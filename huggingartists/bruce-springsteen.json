Excellent, grasshopper! But nobody captured my audiences imagination or their hearts like Clarence. Clarence was, Clarence was a figure out of a rock n roll storybook, and together, we told a story that was bigger than any of the ones I had written in my songs. It was a story where not only does Scooter and the Big Man bust the city in half, but we remade the city. We remade the city shaping into the kind of place where our friendship and our love for one another wouldnt have been such an exceptional thing. First night I saw Clarence he came walkin out of the shadows towards the band stand, nodded to me, got up, stood to my right, for the very first time. He picked up his saxophone, and when he played - when he played, he whispered that story in my ear. And then we whispered it into your ear, and we carried it together for a long, a long good time. The Big Man was big. Everything about him. His personality, his size, his laugh, the sound of his saxophone. When I first heard it I thought it was the biggest sound I ever heard. And it was. His heart, his problems - they were big. But he was elemental in my life. And losing him was like losing the rain. If I were a mystic, if I were a mystic, I guess Clarence and mines friendship would lead me to believe that we, we stood together in other older times, ya know and uh, in other lives, along other rivers, in other ancient cities, in other fields, workin side by side, with the sun settin, doin our modest version of Gods work.

Alright, this is the final days of Pattis first pregnancy. And I receive a surprise visit from my father at my home in LA. Now hed driven 500 miles unannounced to knock on my door, thats his style. So at 11 a.m. we sit Sunday dining room, and were nursing morning beers, thats his style. Thats my fathers breakfast of champions. When, my dad, never a talkative man, right, blurted out, Youve been very good to us. And I nodded that, that I had, ya know, and uh, and he says, And I wasnt very good to you. And, the room just, was, stood still. As to my shock, ya know, the acknowledgeable was being acknowledged, if I, if I didnt know better I wouldve sworn an apology of some sort was being made, and it was. Here in the last days before I was to become a father, my own father was visiting me to warn me of the mistakes that he had made, and to warn me not to make them with my own children. To release them from the chain of our sins, my fathers of mine and our fathers before, that they may be free, to make their own choices and to live their own lives. We are ghosts or we are ancestors in our childrens lives. We either lay our mistakes, our burdens upon them, and we haunt them, or we assist them in laying those old burdens down, and we free them from the chain of our own flawed behavior. And as ancestors, we walk alongside of them, and we assist them in finding their own way, and some transcendence. My father, on that day, was petitioning me, for an ancestral role in my life after being a ghost for a long long time. He wanted me to write a new end to our relationship, and he wanted me to be ready for the new beginning that I was about to experience. It was the greatest moment in my life with my dad, and it was all that I needed", "Well now on a summer night in a dusky room\nCome a little piece of the Lords undying light\nCrying like he swallowed

around the world, people are both still thinking of you and working for your release. Although you were the most visible of the protesters, we know that there were many other young people who have suffered in the protests, about whom we are also very concerned. But, in many ways, through your imprisonment, you have come to represent them.\nMany artists voiced their concern when these charges were first brought against you, we had every hope that the authorities, in dealing with you, would show some understanding, a sense of proportion, even some of the wonderful Russian sense of humour, but none of the above were forthcoming.\nThe impact of your shockingly unjust trial and imprisonment has spread far and wide. Especially among your fellow artists, musicians and citizens around the world, including the many parents who feel your anguish at being separated from your children. While understanding the sensitivities of protesting in a place of worship, we ask that the Russian authorities review these harsh sentences, so that you may return to your children, your families and your lives.\nThe right to freedom of expression and dissent is a legitimate one and essential in any kind of democracy. You have been accused of what could be described as ‘a victimless’ crime, but in our opinion, in a just society, there can be no crime where there is no identifiable ‘victim’.\nYour strength, bravery and fearlessness are an inspiration to us all.\nYours in solidarity,\nBryan Adams, Adele, Alt-J, Laurie Anderson, Animal Collective, Anti-Flag, Arcade Fire, Arch Enemy, Archive, Joan Armatrading, Joan Baez, Beardyman, Jeff Beck, Yasiin Bey, björk, Rubén Blades, Billy Bragg, Jackson Browne, Peter Buck, Tracy Chapman, Chase & Status, Neneh Cherry, The Clash, Coldplay, Lily Rose Cooper, Dido, Django Django, Melissa Etheridge, Siobhan Fahey, Paloma Faith, First Aid Kit, Franz Ferdinand, Foster the People, fun., Peter Gabriel, Sir Bob Geldof, Kim Gordon, Debbie Harry, PJ Harvey, Don Henley, The Hidden Cameras, Niall Horan, Billy Joel, Sir Elton John, Ke$ha, Angelique Kidjo, The Knife, Mark Knopfler, Tom Lehrer, Sean Lennon, Annie Lennox, Lykke Li, Sir Paul McCartney, Romy Madley-Croft, Madonna, Zayn Malik, Stephen Malkmus, Marina & the Diamonds, Johnny Marr, Massive Attack, Mike Mills, Moby, Thurston Moore, Tom Morello, Alanis Morissette, James Morrison, Graham Nash, Kate Nash, Youssou N’Dour, Karen O, Yoko Ono, Clock Opera, Ozzy Osbourne, Liam Payne, Peaches, Joe Perry, Phoenix, Portishead, Portugal.

brigade\nI was open to pain and crossed by the rain\nAnd I walked on a crooked crutch\nI strolled all alone through a fallout zone\nAnd came out with my soul untouched\nI hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd\nBut when they said, Sit down, I stood up\nOoh, growin up\nWell, the flag of piracy flew from my mast\nAnd my sails were set wing to wing\nI had a jukebox graduate for first mate\nShe couldnt sail but she sure could sing\nI pushed B-52 and bombed them with the blues\nWith my gear set stubborn on standing\nI broke all the rules\nStrafed my old high school\nNever once gave thought to landing\nI hid in the clouded warmth of the crowd\nBut when they said, Come down, I threw up\nOoh, growin up\nIve never held an honest job in my entire life. Ive never done any hard labor. Ive never worked nine to five. Ive never worked five days a week until right now. I dont like it. Ive never seen the inside of a factory and yet its all Ive ever written about. Standing before you is a man who has become wildly and absurdly successful writing about something of which he has had - absolutely no personal experience. I made it all up. Thats how good I am. Now how, Im sure youre wondering how did this great miracle come to pass? Well, in the beginning, there was a great darkness upon the waters, as a child, it was Christmas, your birthday, summer vacation, but the rest of life was a lifeless sucking black hole. A lifeless sucking black hole of homework, church, school, homework, church, school, homework, church, school, green beans, green beans, fucking green beans. But then, then a blinding flash of sanctified light, a human being, and just a kid, just a kid from the southern sticks, but uh, new kind of man, he split the world in two, and suddenly, a new world existed. The one below your belt. And above your heart. Sunday night in 1956 at 39 and a half Institute Street into a Coldwater flat and into the mind of a seven year old kid, the revolution had been televised! Right under the noses of the powers that be, who if theyd have known what was actually happening and the great changes, the changes that were about to come, they wouldve shut this shit down, or more likely, signed it up real quick, because we the unwatched, the invisible, the powerless, the kids, would want more. Now more life, more love, and more sex, and more hope, and more truth, and more power, and more soul, and most of all, more rock n roll. So I sat with my mom, my little seven year old mind on fire, staring into a blue tube as fun happened. Fun, the real kind. The joyful, life-affirming, hip-shaking, ass-quaking, guitar-playing, mind and heart-changing, race-challenging, soul-lifting bliss of a freer existence. A freer existence exploded into unsuspecting homes all across America, on a regular Sunday night. The world had fucking changed. In an instant. In a sweating wet orgasm of fun. And all you needed to do to get a taste of it, was to risk being your true self. Because the rock n roll genie had been let out of the bottle and he told us that if you were born in the U.S.A., my fellow citizens, these feelings, these freedoms, this fun, was your birth right. I listened, I believed, and I heard a mighty call to action. So, I studied my new hero. And I noted hes got the same two arms, two legs, two eyes that I got. Yes, hes a human Adonis, and Im - pathetically creepy. But Ill figure that part out, alright. The one thing he had that I didnt have was strapped around his waist. It was the guitar. The guitar, or as my father had christened it, That fucking guitar. But that fucking guitar was the key. It was the sword in the stone, it was the staff of righteousness, and they sell em at Western Auto downtown for 25 dollars! So I begged and I pleaded with my mother just to rent me, cause we couldnt afford to buy a guitar from Mike Deals Music School on South Street. One Saturday afternoon, I brought it home. And I sat on the living room couch. And I unlatched its full alligator case, and I slowly opened it up. And up from the green velvet lining came the sweet smell of a cherrywood cocktail of power, pleasure, salvation, and dreams and dreams and dreams. So I took lessons, dedicatedly, I took lessons for two solid weeks, and I quit. It was too fuckin hard. Learning the guitar, not only was it fucking hard, but the lessons were boring, just give me the three magic chords please! And let me twist! And shout. But I was a seven year old kid and my hands barely fit around the neck and I couldnt waste my mothers hard-earned cash week after week so very shortly I knew, that back it was gonna have to go. But the morning before I returned it, I strapped it on one more time. I took it out into the backyard where the neighborhood kids were. And I put on my first show. Woo! I slapped it. I shook it. I shouted. I sang voodoo nonsense. I burned a hole in the grass. I shook my little seven year old ass, woo! Most importantly, I posed with it. Thats the shit! I danced with it, I did everything but play it. I couldnt do that. I sucked so bad and the kids laughed and laughed at my silly ass. And we brought it back that afternoon. Ridin back home, with my mom in the car, sat in the backseat and I was quiet, was thinking, I was a little disappointed, in myself. But somewhere inside, somewhere inside I knew that for a moment, just a moment, in front of those kids in that backyard, I smelled blood\nI took month-long vacations in the stratosphere\nYou know its really hard to hold your breath\nI swear I lost everything I ever loved or feared\nI was the cosmic kid in full costume dress\nMy feet they finally took root in the earth\nBut I got me a nice little place in the stars\nI swear I found the key to the universe\nIn the engine of an old parked car\nI hid in the clouded wrath of the crowd\nBut when they said, Sit down, I stood up\nOoh, growin up\nOoh, growin up\nAnd it was bye-bye New Jersey! Im gonna be airborne!", "Charles, bring us home!\nI want you all to rise from your seats now please and join us!\nCome on now!

Uh, always been a little complicated for me cause trust requires allowing others to see as much of our real selves as we have the courage to reveal.

But it means allowing others to see behind our many masks, masks we wear, overcomin that fear, or rather learning how to love and how to trust in spite of it.

It was a towering beautiful copper beach tree, and on sunny days, I lived under its branches, its roots, where a fort for my soldiers and a corral for my horses, and I was the first on my block, to climb high into its upper reaches, leaving behind a world that, I didnt care for much already\nAnd up near the top, I had the wind in my face and I had all the dreaming room that you could want. On slow summer nights, Id sit beneath its arms with my pals like the cavalry at dusk, just listening, listening, for the evening bells of the ice cream man. My grandmothers voice calling me into bed\nI lived on Randolph Street, but my sister Virginia, she was a year younger than me, my parents Adele and Douglas, my grandparents Fred and Alice, and my trusty dog Saddle. We lived spitting distance from the Catholic church, the priests rectory, the nuns convent, the Saint Rose of Lima Grammar School, all of it, just a footballs toss away, across the field of wild grass. I literally grew up surrounded by God\nSurrounded by God, and my relatives, cause we had cousins and aunts and uncles and grandmas and grandpas and great grandmas and great grandpas, so all of us were jammed into five little houses on two adjoining streets, and when the church bells rang, the whole clan would hustle up the street to stand witness to every wedding and every funeral that arrived like a state occasion, in our little neighborhood", "For two days the river keeps you down\nThen you rise to the light without a sound\nPast the playgrounds and empty switching yards\nThe turtles eat the

in his arms\nI awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us apart\nWill never again tear us from each others hearts\nI got dressed and to his house I did ride\nFrom out on the road I could see

And all we know about manhood is what we have seen and what we have learned from our fathers, and my father was my hero. And my greatest foe.

And then my dad who for years, he sat at the kitchen table, unreachable, but I was too young, I was too stupid to understand was his depression. Well I kneel next to him in the aisle, and I brush his forearm, and I say, Look dad. That guy on stage - thats how I see you.\nMy fathers house shines hard and bright\nIt stands like a beacon calling me in the night\nCalling and calling so cold and alone\nShining ’cross this dark

I was 19 years old. That felt pretty good.

I wanna release you from suicide watch right now. Snap out of it, come on. Because my mother was bright, happy, shed merrily make conversation with a broom handle, she believed that there was good faith, good heart, good hope in all citizens. She gave the world a lot more credit perhaps than it deserves, but that was her way. Now on school mornings, I hated school, thats just rockstar 101. If you dont hate school in my business, please keep your fucking day job alright? Because its a sign, its a sign that, brother, youre going nowhere man, nowhere. You need to have hatred in your heart to get to the top where I am, alright? Youve got to hate on, uh - so of course I hated getting up and uh, my mom had perfected this technique in the morning where shed stand over my bed with a glass of ice water and give me 30 seconds, eh you know, Five, four, three, two, boom! Niagara Falls. I would get dressed, I would drift downstairs to breakfast where I would feast daily on a huge bowl of sugar pops, a fine product, with just one problem - they dont put enough sugar in those sugar pops. So I wasnt content until I snowed more sugar on my sugar pops until they looked like the Himalayas, and then mmm good, with a buzz on, and a kiss from my mom, I was off, with my sister, lumbering up the street with our book bags, as my moms high heels clicked lightly in the other direction toward Lawyers Title Insurance Company in town center, she was a legal secretary. That was a job she did since the day she got out of high school, fifty years to follow. Goes to work, doesnt miss a day, never sick, never down, never complains, work doesnt appear to be a burden for her but its a source of energy and of social pleasure. Now, some evenings I would meet my mother at closing time and we would be the last to leave the office and this was always a great privilege to me. I would have my mother all to myself, and with the building empty, her high heels would echo down the long linoleum hallway, and with the fluorescent lights out, lawyers cubicles empty, secretaries; desks empty, typewriters covered, silent, the building was so still, after all the noise of the day ya know it was so, it got so quiet, it was as if - it, it was as if the building itself was resting after a long day of service in the interest of our town. And then suddenly wed be through the front door and out on Main Street in five oclock rush hour and she would stride along, statuesque, and, Id be runnin alongside her just, trying to keep up and I would be, ya know, looking up at her, and uh, its a sight Ive never f-, never forgotten - my mother walking home from work, had some - just some eternal impact on me, ya know uh, she uh, she always had these very ethnic features, she had coal black hair, Italian olive skin, and when she was young she wore that red lipstick, that was very fashionable, in the 50s. And shed be looking down at me with a look that for me, was like the grace of Mary, Made me understand for the first time how good it feels, feel pride in somebody that you love, and who loves you back, ya know. She let the town know that we are handsome, responsible members of this shit dog bird, pullin our own individual weight doin what has to be done day after day, we have a place here that we have earned, and we have a reason to open our eyes at the break of each day and breathe in a life thats steady and good. My mom was truthfulness, consistency, good humor, professionalism, grace, kindness, optimism, civility, fairness, pride in yourself, responsibility, love, faith in your family, commitment, joy your work, and a never-say-die thirst for living - for living. For living and for life. And most importantly, for dancing. My mother and her two sisters were dancing machines, alright.

mill, and then he went off to war, and when he came home, got married, they shut the rug mill down, so he went to work on the Ford motor plant in New Brunswick, then he worked at the Nescafe plant in Freehold, worked in a plastics factory in town, he was a truck driver, bus driver, drove a taxi, he lived mostly at home, except for his second home which was a little local bar in the center of town. Now to a child, bars in Freehold were these citadels of great mystery. When you walked through bar room doors in my hometown, you entered the mystical realm of men. On the rare night, that my mother would call my father home, we would slowly drive through town until we drew to a stop outside of a single lit door, shed look at me and say, Go in and get your dad. This both thrilled and terrified me. It thrilled me because I had been given the license by my mother, the law, to go into the bar! Im a kid! But it terrified me because to enter the bar is to enter my fathers priveleged, private, and sacred space. He was not to be disturbed when hes down at the bar. Everybody knew that. So I would walk in, and I was waist-high, like a Jack who climbed some dark beanstalk into a land of giants, all I remember is the men towering over me on their way out the door. Now once you were in, to the left against the wall was a line of red leather booths that were filled with husband and wife tag team drinkers. Now there were your hardcore regulars there night after night after night, alright now to the right was the bar, a line of stools filled by a barricade of broad working class backs clinking glasses, too loud laughter, and very few women. I would stand there lost in the noise and the hustle of the crowd and I would drink in that dim smell of beer and booze and aftershave. Now to a kid, that was the scent of adulthood. It was the scent of manhood. I wanted some of that. And finally somebody would notice me, and draw me over to my pop, now my view from the Ford was the first thing Id see was the chrome legs of the barstool. Then Id see his black shoes, white socks, dark green work trousers, powerful legs and haunches, my dad til the day he died had the legs and the ass of a rhinoceros. And, and his trousers always looked like they were stretched. stretched over that legs and ass somehow, I dont know how. He was always bustin out ya know, uh, then I would see his black Garrison work belt, his green work shirt, and then his face. By the time I got there his face was flushed red, red as a tomato because he was Irish and whatever he drank went straight to his face, alright. He couldnt hide a thing when he came home, ya know, uh, and not only was it red, like it - it was like distorted too, into some sort of booze mask, by, by Mr. Schlitz and, and, it was so foreign to me as a child that, it - he - fuck I dont know, ha ha, but it was scary and hed be peering down over his shoulder, down at the cigarette smoke and hed be lookin at me like Ive never seen you before in my fuckin life. I then uttered the immortal words that I was sent to deliver - Mom wants you to come home. Id hear, Go outside, I will be right out, and I would follow my breadcrumb trail back out the bar room door, I would hop into the backseat, and I would inform my mother, Um, hell be right out, hell be right out", "You may think Im fooling\nFor the foolish things I do\nYou may wonder how come I love you\nWhen you get on my nerves like you do\nWell baby you know you bug me\nThere aint no secret about that\nWell, come on over here and hug me\nBaby Ill spill the facts\nWell, honey it aint your money\nCause I got plenty of that\nI love you for your pink Cadillac\nCrushed velvet seats\nRiding in the back, oozing down the street\nWaving to the girls, peeling out of sight\nSpending all my money on a Saturday night\nHoney, I just wonder what you do\nThere in the back of your pink Cadillac\nPink Cadillac\nWell, now way back in the Bible\nTemptations always come along\nTheres always somebody tempting you\nInto doing something they know is wrong\nWell, they tempt you, maam, with silver\nAnd they tempt you, sir, with gold\nAnd they tempt you with the pleasures\nThat flesh does surely hold\nThey say Eve tempted Adam with an apple\nMan, I aint going for that\nI know it was her pink Cadillac\nCrushed velvet seats\nRiding in the back, oozing down the street\nWaving to the girls, peeling out of sight\nSpending all my money on a Saturday night\nHoney, I just wonder what youre doing\nIn the back of your pink Cadillac\nPink Cadillac\nNow, now, now, some folks say its too big\nAnd uses too much gas\nSome folks say that its too old\nAnd that it just goes too fast\nOh, but love is bigger than a Honda \nAnd its bigger than a Subaru \nHey man theres only one thing\nAnd one car that will do\nAnyway we dont have to drive it\nHoney, we can park it out in back\nAnd have a party in your pink Cadillac\nCrushed velvet seats\nRiding in the back, oozing down the street\nWaving to the girls, peeling out of sight\nSpending all my money on a Saturday night\nHoney, I just wonder what you do there\nIn the back of your pink Cadillac\nYou know the one I mean, Le Car\nWoah!

But uh, all I know is the streets were dead empty and the whole place looked like itd been locked down since 1955. My corner church was silent and unchanged, no weddings, no funerals, I, rolled slowly another 50 yards up my block to visit my great tree and it was gone. Itd been cut to the street since the last time that I had drove through. So I got out of the car and I looked down, and there was a square of musty earth that held the remaining snakes of its roots on the edge of the parking lot. So I reached down, I picked up a handful of dirt and I just kinda ran it through my hands, and my heart sank like, like a kid who suffered from irretrievable loss, ya know, like, like some, some piece of me was gone.

Its imprint was too great, it was too old, and it was too strong, it had been there too long, to be done away with so easily. It had stood witness to everything that had happened on these small streets beneath its arms. All the joy, and all the heartbreak, and all the life.

I never believed that people came to my shows, or rock shows in general, to be told anything. But I do believe that they come to be reminded of things, to be reminded of who they are, that theyre most joyous at their deepest, when life feels full. Its a good place to get in touch with your heart and your spirit. Its good to be amongst the crowd, be reminded of who we are and who we can be collectively, and music does those things pretty well. Sometimes, they can come in pretty handy. And particularly these days, some reminding of who we are and who we can be isnt such a bad thing, ya know, uh. I uh, I re- I refer back to the weekend of the March for our Lives when we saw all those young people in Washington and citizens all around the country remind us of what faith in America and what real faith in American democracy, and how sacred that is. When uh, that weekend, you just saw what it actually looked like and felt like. It was just encouraging, to see all those people out on the street and all that righteous passion alive in the service of something good, to see it still there at the center of the beating heart of our country, and, in spite of what weve been goin through, it was a good day ya know, it was just, it was just one good day. But it was a necessary day. Because these are the times when weve also seen folks marching, and in the highest offices of our land who want to speak to our darkest angels, who want to call up the ugliest and the most divisive ghosts of Americas past, and they want to destroy the idea of an America for all. Thats their intention. Thats what weve been seeing in the outrage of the broken families on the border, and in hate-filled marches on American streets, this year. Things I never thought I would see again in my lifetime. Things that I thought that were dead and gone forever, on the ash heap of history. Ya know uh, ya know weve come too far and worked too hard, too many good people paid too high a price, and paid, paid with their lives to allow this to happen now. Ya know. Theres been too much hard work done, and sacrifice. Theres a beautiful quote by Dr. King that says, The arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice. It is important to believe in those words and to carry yourself, and to act accordingly, to live with compassion, and have faith in that what were seeing now, is just another hard chapter, in the long long ongoing battle for the soul of the nation", "So - so Im 20 years old, and Im livin and playin on the Jersey shore and Im waitin to be discovered. Now, I have some confidence. Ive been around a bit, and without a doubt, I am definitely the best thing that Ive ever seen. Ive already played in front of every conceivable audience. I had played firemans fairs, midnight madness supermarket openings, drive-in movies, uh, in front of the concession stand in between films, Ive played beach parties, offices, clubs, pizza parlors, coffee shops, bowling alleys, trailer parks, roller rinks, VFW halls, CYO canteens, the elks lodge, YMCA gymnasiums, hockey rinks, county fairs, carnivals, high school dances, weddings, fraternity parties, bar mitzvahs, soul revues, battle of the bands, Sing Sing Prison, and Marlboro Psychiatric Hospital. Send me your murderers and your maniacs and let me entertain em, alright? Its what I do. Thats all true. Thats all before I was 23 years old. Im frustrated, I listen to the radio and I think Im as good as that guy, Im better than that guy, so why not me? Answer: because I live in the fucking Boondocks, alright. Let me explain this to you. I live in the boondocks. There is nobody here and no one comes down here. Its a grave. There was no Jersey, Jersey, Jersey Shore, Jersey Almighty shit. I invented that. Before me, Jersey was Jeserkistan. Jeserkistan! One of the little -stan things that nobody knows a fuckin thing about, ya know. And New York was a million miles away from the Jersey Shore. In my little town as a child we knew no one who had ever been to New York City. Jesus Christ, it was only an hour away! But no, you might as well have said youre goin to the fuckin moon! Hey, were goin to the moon, you wanna go? No, no, no, no New York, were provincial, everybody was afraid ya know, everybody was afraid of the big city. And there was no internet, there was no ET, or MTV, or cable TV or satellite or, this is before anyone and everyones asscrack from any place U.S.A. could be seen all over the world, should they choose, in the push of a key, in the next instant. So who was gonna come to the Jersey shore, to discover the next big thing in 1971? Youre correct. No fuckin body. All we heard down there was the sound of, one hand clapping. Wasnt gonna happen", "8 A.M., Im up and my feet beating on the sidewalk\nDown at the unemployment agency, all I gets talk\nI check the want ads but there just aint nobody hiring\nWhats a man supposed to do when hes down and\nOut of work\nI need a job, Im out of work\nIm unemployed, Im out of work\nI need a job, Im out of work\nI go to pick my girl up\nHer name is Linda Brown\nHer dad invites me in\nHe tells me to sit down\nThe small talk that were making\nIs going pretty smooth\nBut then he drops a bomb\nSon, what dya do?\nIm out of work\nI need a job, Im out of work\nIm unemployed, Im out of work\nI need a job, Im out of work\nYeah, yeah, yeah\nHey, Mr. President, I know you got your plans\nYoure doing all you can now to aid the little man\nWe got to do our best to whip that inflation down\nMaybe you got a job for me just driving you around\nThese tough times, theyre enough\nTo make a man lose his mind\nUp there you got a job but down here below\nIm out of work\nI need a job, Im out of work\nIm unemployed, Im out of work\nI need a job, Im out of work\nOoh, Im out of work\nIm out of work\nIm out of work\nIm out of work\nIm out of work\nIm out of work\nIm out of work\nIm out of work", "So now its just Tinker, me, Tinkers dog, thousands of miles to go, and we got several problems, one is I have no license. Second problem is I dont have a clue as to how to drive. And by that I mean the man who would very very shortly write Racing in the Street - thats how good I am. Because at 21, I had never driven a fucking block. Around 1 or 2 AM, Tinkers eyes glass over and he says, Im fried. I need to get some sleep. Its your turn to drive. I go, Tink, I cant drive. He says, Springsteen, theres nothing to it. Idiots all over the world are doin it. Oh yeah? He pulls me into a parking lot, he puts me behind the wheel, I start grindin gears, pumpin the clutch, jerkin the truck all over the lot, its a 1940s manual transmission and I cant get past first gear! After a moment Tinker says, This isnt gonna work. But I got another idea. He gets in the drivers seat. He slips in the clutch. He smoothly shifts it into first. He eases out on the clutch. He gets that truck goin on a sweet little roll, looks at me and says, Now lets switch seats. And thats what we did. I was fine in second, third, and fourth, and I could keep it in between the lines as long as I didnt have to stop or go near first gear. If I gotta do either of those things I have to wake up Mr. West, alright. Now, it doesnt matter because hes awake anyway, because the guy who cant drive is drivin! Youre not gonna sleep through that! So, uh, youd be surprised how far you can go across this big country without having to stop, ya know, its, its a long ways between things out there, and man I drove my share. 2000 miles in second, third, and fourth gear. Without killing anybody. Uh, and we made it on time, ya know, but - that trip was, was where I saw the United States at its fullest, and as a young man I was overwhelmed by its size and its beauty and, this is a short piece from the book about riding across the country for the very first time. The country was beautiful, and I felt a great elation at the wheel as we crossed the western desert at dawn. The deep blue, purple shadow canyons, pale yellow morning sky, all of its color drawn out, leaving just the black silhouetted mountains in your rear view mirror. And then with the eastern sun rising at our backs, the deep reds and the browns of the plains and the hills came to life slowly in front of us. Our palms turned salty white on the wheel from the aridity. Morning woke the earth into this muted color, and then came the flat light of the midday sun, and everything stood revealed as pure horizon. Just sky, sky, sky, and more sky. Lowering on the two lanes of black top, and disappearing into nothing. My favorite thing. Then the evening, with the sun burning red into your eyes, and droppin gold into the western hills in front of ya. All felt like home to me. And I fell into a lasting love affair with the desert", "We said wed walk together, darling, come what may\nAnd that come the twillight should we lose our way\nIf as were walking a hand should slip

a rack of paperback books, I come across a book called Born on the Fourth of July by a Vietnam veteran named Ron Kovic. Now this book was a testimony of the experience hed had as a combat infantry man in southeast Asia. Week or two later, Im bunked in at the fabulous Sunset Marquis Motel in Los Angeles. Uh, for the uninformed, its kind of an upscale, uh, low-life rockstar hangout, alright? Uh, small world theory. Small world theory proves itself once again. I been seein a young guy with shoulder-length hair sittin in a wheelchair by the pool for several days. So uh, one afternoon, he rolled up to me and said, Hi, Im Ron Kovic. I wrote a book called Born on the Fourth of July. I said, Jesus, I just, I just read it, and when it, it destroyed me, and, he spent the afternoon\nTalkin to me about many returned soldiers who were struggling with a wide variety of problems and he wanted to know if Id take a drive with him to the vet center in Venice, meet some of the southern California veterans. So I said sure, next day we headed out there and Im usually pretty easy with people, but once we were at the center, I didnt know how to respond to what I was seein. Uh, talkin about my own life to these guys seemed frivolous. There was homelessness and drug problems and post-traumatic stress, and young guys my age dealing with life-changing physical injuries, and it made me think about my own friends from back home. Walter Cichon. Walter Cichon was the greatest rock n roll frontman on the Jersey shore in the bar band 60s. He was in a group called The Motifs, and he was the first real rockstar that I ever laid my eyes on. He just had it in his bones, he had it in his blood, it was in the way he carried himself. On stage, he just, was deadly. He was raw and sexual, and dangerous and in our little area, he taught us, by the way that he lived, that you could live your life the way you chose, you could look the way you wanted to look, you could play the music you wanted to play, you could be who you wanted to be, and you could tell anyone who didnt like it to go fuck themselves. Walter had a guitar playin brother, Raymond. Raymond was tall, tall kind of sweetly clumsy guy, one of those big guys, who just isnt comfortable with his size. Hes always like, ooh, ooh, knockin into shit wherever he is, and wherever that is, there is just not enough space for Raymond, for some reason. And uh, but, but then strangely he was always dressed impeccably, ya know, with a pastel shirt, long pointed collar, shark skin pants, nylon socks, spit-shined pointy toed shoes, slicked back black hair with a little curl that would come down when he was playin the guitar. Uh, Raymond was my guitar hero. And he was just a shoe salesman in the day. And uh, Walter I think worked construction, and they were only a little bit older than we were. Never had any national hit records. Never did any big tours. But they were gods to me. And uh, the hours I spent standing in front of their band, studying, studying, studying, class in session, night after night watchin Rays fingers fly over the fretboard and Walter scare, the shit outta half the crowd, oh man. Ya know, they were essential to my development as a young musician. I learned so much from Walter and from Ray. And my dream was I just wanted to play like Ray, and walk like Walter", "On the road to Basra stood young Lieutenant Jimmy Bly\nDetailed to go through the clothes of the soldiers who died\nAt night in

Bart Hanes was the drummer from my first band, The Castilles. He was the first real drummer I ever played with. He was absurdly funny kid, classic class clown, was a good good drummer, with one strange quirk - couldnt play Wipeout by The Safaris. This may not seem so critical to you right now, I understand, but, in those days, your skills, your mettle, your self-worth as a drummer and as a human being, was tested in front of your peers once an evening by your performance of Wipeout. Now Bart could play every other fucking thing, but when it came to Wipeout - beyond his capabilities. Was tragic, ya know. One day, he got off, he got up off the drum stool, he joined the Marines, then uh, Walter and Bart, they were both killed in the war in 1967 and 68. Bart was the first young man from our hometown to give his life in Vietnam. So, I really didnt know what to say to the guys I was meeting in Venice. I sat there for most of the afternoon and just listened. Then in 1982 I wrote and I recorded my soldier story. It was a protest song, the G.I. blues. The verses were just accounting of events, the choruses were a declaration of your birthplace, and the right to all the blood, and the confusion, and the pride, and the shame, and the grace, that comes with birthplace. 1969, Mad Dog, little Vinnie, and myself, we were all drafted, on the exact same day. All three of us. We rode together early one Monday morning from the selective service office on probably the unhappiest bus that ever pulled out of Asbury Park. Because we were on our way to what we were sure was going to be our funeral. Wed seen it already, all very up close. And when we got to the Newark draft board, we did everything we could not to go. And uh, we succeeded, all three of us, when I go to Washington, and I vacation to visit Walter and Bart, Im glad that Mad Dogs, little Vinnies, for that matter, my name, isnt up on, on that wall, but it was 1969 and thousands and thousands of young men to come would be called, simply sacrificed, just to save face for the powers that be, who by then already knew, they knew it was a lost cause. And still thousands and thousands of more young boys. So uh, so I do sometimes who went in my place, because somebody did", "Cold rain running down the front of my shirt\nIm flat on my back wheels in the dirt\nAngel makes her face up out on Baker Street\nShes straddling the shifter in my front seat\nTheres nothing to lose, its a heartbreak\nThe decks stacked\nSo put your foot to the floor and darling dont look back\nWere making night tracks through the blazing rain\nBlowin pistons, workin the fast lane\nRed line burnin, pockets full of cash\nAngel writes her name in lipstick on my dash\nTheres nothing to lose\nIts a bad break but baby were backed\nTonight well blow off the doors and honey we wont look back\nWe held it in our hearts in the pourin rain\nWe made it through the heart of a hurricane\nWe tore it apart and put it together again\nWell angel, wont you believe in love for me\nCmon and meet me tonight, darling, out in the street\nWell move with the city in the dark\nYou got to walk, it talk, it in your heart\nTheres nothin to lose its a heartache\nThe decks stacked\nSo put your foot to the floor, darling\nTonight well blow off the doors, baby\nWere gonna even the score", "There was a woman waiting at the well\nDrawing water beneath a desert sky of blue\nShe said Hell heal the blind, raise the dead\nCure the sickness out of you\nCome on men of Gideon\nCome all men of Saul\nCome all sons of Abraham\nWaiting outside heavens wall\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nAnd together well walk into Canaan land\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nHe saw the watcher at the city gates\nJonah in the belly of a whale\nHe watched you walk your ragged mile\nHis mercy it did not fail\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nAnd together well walk into Canaan land\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nLai lai-lai lai, lai lai-lai lai, lai lai-lai lai, lai lai-lai lai\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nAnd together well walk into Canaan land\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nAnd together well walk into Canaan land\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nAnd together well walk into Canaan land\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand\nAnd together well walk into Canaan land\nRaise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand", "Well, they blew up the chicken man in philly last night\nNow, they blew up his house, too\nDown on the boardwalk theyre gettin ready for a fight\nGonna see what them racket boys can do\nNow, theres trouble bustin in from outta state\nAnd the d.a. cant get no relief\nGonna be a rumble out on the promenade\nAnd the gamblin commissions hangin on by the skin of his teeth\nWell now, evrything dies, baby, thats a fact\nBut maybe evrything that dies someday comes back\nPut your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty\nAnd meet me tonight in atlantic city\nWell, I got a job and tried to put my money away\nBut I got debts that no honest man can pay\nSo I drew what I had from the central trust\nAnd I bought us two tickets on that coast city bus\nNow, baby, evrything dies, baby, thats a fact\nBut maybe evrything that dies someday comes back\nPut your makeup on, fix your hair up pretty\nAnd meet me tonight in atlantic city\nNow our luck may have died and our love may be cold\nBut with you forever Ill stay\nWere goin out where the sands turnin to gold\nPut on your stockins baby, cause the nights getting cold\nAnd maybe evrything dies, baby, thats a fact\nBut maybe evrything that dies someday comes back", "I had one shot, my girlfriend at the time did me a great favor, brought a guy who had a successful recording band down to the Student Prince, our club, Asbury Park, to discover us. We got up on a little stage that fit 150 people, was about half full, and we played for this guy like we were at Madison Square Garden. Everything we had, all night long. We played five sets from 9pm til 3am. At the end of the night, I was soaked to my bones, I got off the band stand, this guy walked up to me, looked me in the eye, shook my hand and said, You guys are the best unsigned band Ive ever seen. Then he slept with my girlfriend and left town. Thats the end of that story. Its a sad ending, ya know. But that was enough for me. I gathered together the men, and I said, Gentlemen, we are going to have to leave the confines of the Jersey shore and venture into parts unknown if we wanna be seen, heard, by anybody, or discovered. Now, I found a manager, surfboard manufacturer from the west coast, hed moved east by the name of Carl Virgil Tinker West. Now, together he, Mad Dog Lopez, and myself, we lived in the surfboard factory, in the industrial wastelands of Wanamassa, New Jersey. Tinker said he had some remaining rock n roll contacts in San Francisco so we all got excited, and he said if we could get there, somethin might happen. So we saved up all our money until we had 100 dollars, alright?. And then me, Danny Federici, Mad Dog Lopez, little Vinnie Roslin our bass player, rigged out Dannys station wagon for the drive, put a mattress in the back for the drivers to spell each other into sleep, then on the way out there, we rigged Tinkers old 40s flatbed to carry our equipment, and we had three days to make it across the country for a New Years Eve gig in Big Sur, California. Now three days means those are gonna be thousand mile days. You can make it, but you cant stop. You stop for gas and for nothing else. You drive, drive, drive, drive, 72 hours straight, somebodys drivin all the time, around the clock. Now of course we lost Danny and the entire station wagon full of drivers in Nashville, Tennessee. Now, theres no cellular phones - young people, take a moment. Lets try it. Imagine a world without the cellular phone. When you lose someone in that world without the cellular phone, oh theyre fuckin lost. Theres no device! You cant get in touch with em, theyre gone! Out of your life!

This album portrays urban industrial life, building images both of the hardship and desperation of normal life, and of a promised freedom, found outside the city in empty highways and fast cars. This album and its representation of society echo many of the main tenets of transcendentalism, especially its aversion to society and desire to escape it. While this was most probably not intentional, the album’s message bears a remarkable similarity to the beliefs set forth in transcendentalist writing.\nBruce Springsteen’s “Born To Run” album, while it is not directly transcendentalist, is motivated by the same dissatisfaction with the society, and advocates for the same departure from society. While the album was new and creative in many regards, the format of the album itself is exceedingly unimaginative. Most vinyl albums would have between eight and ten songs, with four or five per side. “Born To Run,” with eight songs total, was no exception. With this arrangement, the first songs of each side are, respectively, Thunder Road and Born to Run. In this format, these two songs are given the most emphasized positions on the album. Perhaps because of this, they are the two songs most indicative of the album’s message.\nThunder Road describes the singer’s invitation to a woman, Mary, to drive away together on “thunder road.” In the song, society, and life within it, are described as broken, desperate, and decidedly unidealized. Mary, while she is described as “a vision” in the first lines, is later told, rather undiplomatically, “you ain’t a beauty, but, hey you’re all right.” Society waits for “a savior to rise from these streets,” but even Springsteen is “not a hero.” He and Mary have “one last chance to make it real” in a “town full of losers.” Society overall is portrayed as smothering, and hopeless, with escape to Thunder Road their last hope.\nStanding out from Springsteen’s unrelentingly bleak landscape is Thunder Road, the only thing idealized or glorified in the song. However, Thunder Road itself is left ambiguous. If it is a place, it is never specified, but it is described as “two lanes that will take anywhere”. However, the focus is not on Thunder Road as a place, but rather as an action or a state of being. They are leaving, not to reach a specific place, but rather “to case the promised land.” His deliberate imprecision makes his offer even more appealing to the audience, who can create Thunder Road in their mind as they wish.\nThe other main song of the album is “Born to Run.” It gives the title to the album, and is one of Springsteen’s most famous songs. This song has a similar structure to “Thunder Road,” in that it describes the singer’s promise to a woman that they are “born to run” from all of the stifling influences of society. Society is described here as a “death trap,” that “rips the bones from your back.” He states that “ gotta get out while young.” Again, Springsteen promises that “we’re gonna get to that place/ where we really want to go.” Here he also chooses to make their final place of freedom as vague as possible. However, the song is still centered entirely around their escape from society.\nTranscendentalism was a literary movement that arose in the late 1800’s as a reaction to industrialization and the cultural and environmental changes that followed the industrial revolution. It had two main components: First, an aversion to the structure and institution of society, and second, a desire to leave society altogether, continuously traveling away from society into nature to try to escape its influence. This album parallels the argument made by transcendentalism in both of these respects. In both of the songs discussed above, the song begins by portraying society as smothering and painful.\nIn these songs, society is described not only as unidealistic or unpleasant, but as deadly. In Thunder Road, they live in “a town full of losers,” while in Born to Run the town is a “suicide rap” that “rips the bones from your back.” Springsteen’s characters are trapped in a society that they find to be a “death trap,” and they look for escape through driving. Where transcendentalism looked for societal escape in nature, Springsteen looks for it in driving. Thunder Road is focused entirely on Springsteen’s offer of freedom, which he offers in the form of Thunder Road. They are driving “to case the promised land,” and to leave on “two lanes that will take anywhere.” Similarly, in Born to Run they ride at night through “mansions of glory,” and while the “highway is jammed with broken heroes,” they can escape because they are born to run.\nBeyond just wishing to leave, their aversion to society is fundamental and unchanging- they are “born to run” until they reach “that place where really want to go.” Springsteen’s word choice in “born to run” implies that they are different from the rest of society in a basic and innate way. In addition, it implies that they will continue running forever. In Thunder Road as well, the focus is not on the location and nature of Thunder Road as a destination, but instead on its characteristics as a means or process of escape. This parallels the transcendental idea that escape from society is found in the continuing act of leaving society, rather than reaching a specific place. Here, as in transcendentalism, society must be escaped in order for the individual to be happy, but for Springsteen his means of escaping society lies in driving away, rather than withdrawing to nature.\nOne major criticism of transcendentalism is its sexism. Transcendentalism focuses on the manly virtues of the intrepid explorer of nature. Here the poet or speaker is obviously male, and has all the traits of traditional manly virtue. He brings the ideas of transcendentalism to those yet unenlightened, who are defined as those still stuck in the structure and institution of society. Women are left out of the image of the transcendentalist, and included only implicitly in those still trapped in society. This undercurrent is reflected in Springsteen’s portrayal of women in these two songs. In both songs Springsteen is the one with the knowledge of how to escape from society. The woman in both songs lacks character development, and occupies the more passive role- escape is offered to them, rather than vice versa. The image of the woman between the two songs is entirely interchangeable- the only difference between them is their names. All of the agency and wisdom is given to the speaker, while the woman’s role is simply to get into the passenger seat.\nWhile the “Born To Run” album was not produced as a work of transcendentalism, it shows many parallels to their arguments. In Springsteen’s case, the reaction is not against the industrialization of society, but rather against the structure and hierarchy of society. Escape is found through the items of industrialization that the original transcendentalists were trying to escape. The reaction is not against the technology associated with industrialization, but instead with the social arrangements that follow industrialization. Throughout his music, Springsteen deliberately chooses to portray blue-collar, working class life. Choosing to portray this section of society builds his argument against the hierarchy of society. More broadly however, the parallels between the two arguments show that the impulse to escape society is still attractive to many within society. However, the choice to run to mechanical escapes rather than natural ones could reflect that society as a whole is no longer uncomfortable with the idea of industrialization- society as a whole likes its mechanical comforts too much to try to return to an age without industrial technology. This shows that it is the effects of the order and structure of society, rather than the effect of technology, that make individual members of society wish to leave.", "The screen door slams, Marys
