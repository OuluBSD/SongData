pussy, vacation\nAnd influence a generation thats lacking in patience\nIve been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience\nJust me and my old man getting back to basics\nWeve been talking bout the future and time that we wasted\nWhen he put that bottle down, girl, that niggas amazing\nWell, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas\nWe might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us\nWe

culture\nTell me who dissin, I got some things thatll hit the culprit\nThem strep throat flows, them shits to stop all of the talkin\nAll of the talkin, got one reply for all of your comments\nFuck what you think, Im too busy, thats why you leave a message\nBorn a perfectionist, guess that makes me a bit obsessive\nThat shit I heard from you lately really relieved some pressure\nLike ayy, B, I got your CD, you get an E for effort\nI piece letters together and get to talkin reckless\nOwl chains like credentials, you know you see the necklace\nMy lifes a completed checklist\nIm tired of hearin bout who you checkin for now\nJust give it time, well see whos still around a decade from now\nThats real\nHow much time is this nigga spendin on the intro?\nLately Ive been feelin like Guy Pearce in Memento\nI just set the bar, niggas fall under it like a limbo\nThe family all that matters, Im just out here with my kinfolk\nOff everything my pen wrote, we went from Bundy to Winslow\nThis for shorty up on Glengrove who love when I catch my tempo\nI sip the Pora and listen to Cappadonna \nThe fresh prince, just had dinner with Tatyana, no lie\nAll these nineties fantasies on my mind\nThe difference is that with mine, they all come true in due time\nI might come through without security to check if youre fine\nThats just me on my solo like Fuck it, like YOLO\nWanted to tell you, Accept yourself\nYou dont have to prove shit to no one except yourself\nAnd if you end up needin some extra help, then I could help\nYou know, back on your feet and shit\nTryna get my karma up, fuck the guilty and greedy shit\nHow much time is this nigga spendin on the intro?\nHow this nigga workin like he got a fuckin twin though?\nLife is soundin crazy, 40 on Martin Scorsese\nAnd I wouldnt change a thing if you paid me\nNow real nigga, wassup?\nAyy, yeah, ayy\nHow much time is this nigga spendin on the intro?\nIf theres hell below, Ill see you when you get there\nAre you enjoyin yourselves?\nIf we may, we would just like to close off with somethin a bit inspirational\nHopefully something a bit relevant as to us all are having the same fears, shedding similar tears, and of course dying in so many years\nIt dont mean that we cant have a good life\nSo wed like to just maybe close out with something, some food for thought, for all of us\n177Embed", "Facts Lyrics\nDirt and

someone else can feel they pain\nI always hear people complain about the place that they live\nThat all the people here are fake and they got nothin to give\nCause they been starin at somebody elses version of shit\nThat makes another city seem more excitin than it is\nI know a girl whose one goal was to visit Rome\nThen she finally got to Rome\nAnd all she did was post pictures for people at home\nCause all that mattered was impressin everybody shes known\nI know another girl thats cryin out for help\nBut her latest caption is Leave me alone\nI know a girl happily married til she puts down her phone\nI know a girl that saves pictures from places shes flown\nTo post later and make it look like she still on the go\nLook at the way we live\nI wasnt hidin my kid from the world\nI was hidin the world from my kid\nFrom empty souls who just wake up and look to debate\nUntil you starin at your seed, you can never relate\nBreakin news in my life, I dont run to the blogs\nThe only ones I wanna tell are the ones I can call\nThey always ask, Why let the story run if its false?\nYou know a wise man once said nothin at all\nIm exhausted and drained, I cant even pretend\nAll these people takin miles when you give em an inch\nAll these followers but who gon follow me to the end?\nI guess Ill make it to the end and Ima find out then\nYouve got me fe–\nYou, ohhhh, ayy\nHigher,

be alive for it\nCant get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it\nYou know 40 wants peace but Im down to cut ties for it\nAnd I cant sleep these days unless I take one\nIf they dont have a

it\n\n… And then when I saw the news\nMake me feel afraid of how I’d been to you\nTrust me when I say I thought it all through\nTrust me when I say that shit is old moves\nGod made himself a way from

info I give to you niggas\nIm on the brink of influential, Im here for you niggas\nI guess a hit doesnt add up to a career for you niggas\nI must have been hard to watch, what a year for you niggas\nIts December 31st and we in Miami just meditating\nYou got your resolutions, we just got reservations\nLiving out a dream it feels like I stayed up\nAnd we just want to party, Patron straight up\nFuck that old shit, Im on new things\nOVO Clique, Red Wing Boot Gang\nYeah we want it all, half was never the agreement\nWhod have thought the route wed chosen\nWould ever end up this scenic?\nI can relate to kids going straight to the league\nWhen they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed\nAnd thats around the time\nThat your idols become your rivals\nYou make friends with Mike\nBut got to A.I. him for your survival\nDamn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous\nCause we want to be them, and they want to be us\nSo on behalf of the demanded and the entertainment\nThat you take for granted, y-you can thank me now\nAnd oh my goodness youre welcome, youre welcome\nAt this point me is who I am trying to save myself from\nRappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them\nCause they think that I can help them\nGet back to where they fell from\nBut drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight\nExcept the niggas that I came with, they good for life\nYeah, thats how you know its going down\nIn case another chance never comes around\nY-You could thank me now , go head\nThank me later, yeah I know what I said\nBut later doesnt always come so instead\nIts okay, you could thank me now \nUh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimming\nI think Im spending all my time with the wrong women\nI think Ill have a chance at love and knowing me, Ill miss it\nCause me dedicating my time just isnt realistic\nMan, the good girls went silent on me\nThey got a boyfriend, or left for college on me\nAnd all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now\nThat make me wish I had a little less mileage on me\nBut do I ever come up in discussion\nOver double pump lattes and low fat muffins?\nDo I? Or is missing what we had out of the question?\nIm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson\nI got flows for the Marilyn Monroes\nWho was there before it all, I guess thats how it goes\nThey hear about your cons, but focus on your pros\nAnd love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul\nBut those same ones from your area will grow into women\nThat are ready to get married at Hello\nBecause of what they allowed, where are they all now?\nI know theyre somewhere watching\nSo Im trying to make them proud\nSearching for the meaning, youll find it next to me\nThey tell me Im the hottest, guess we finally get to see\nIm feeling like Nas, who am I to disagree?\nThey say the doors will open up soon as you find the missing key\nThats probably why Im in this bitch shining\nJump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment\nI rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded\nAnd the bandwagons full but you can try and run behind it–\nIm sorry\nPoolside drinking, Margarita rounds\nShout out to my city though I hardly be in town\nIm the black sheep but Chris Farley wears the crown\nAnd I know life is just a game in which the cards are facing down\nIm in a world where things are taken, never given\nHow long they choose to love you will never be your decision\nAnd Im aware that this could be the last time you listen\nSo while Im still here in this position\nY-you could thank me now , go head \nThank me later, yeah I know what I said \nBut later doesnt always come so instead\nIts okay, you could thank me now\nIts a- okay 29Embed", "Big Amount Lyrics\nIma tell you, Ima tell you this right now\nIf you, if you woke up this mornin, nigga you winnin for real\nI got a big amount, I took a different route\nI am the pick of the litter\nI was in juvy, they gave me community\nI had to pick up some litter\nI want it easy, please do not tease me\nI wore my Yeezys to dinner\nThis is the season, I got the seasonin\nDont make me sprinkle you niggas\nI got my reasons, you wanna please me\nSend me the pussy, not pictures\nMet her this week and fucked her this evenin\nShe turn a freak on the liquor\nYeah, I am a boss on these bitches\nYeah, I pour some Voss on these bitches\nYeah, I have no thoughts on these bitches\nYeah, rock double-cross on these bitches, yeah\nDearly departed, gather today\nOn some Prince shit\nYou know what they say\nMe and my safe, got a friendship\nTen on me, thin weight, flip weight, gettin paid\nGettin laid\nBitch made, took off sick days\n6 trey, 6-4 bounce, bitch, bounce\nHood nigga, favorite spot was the Waffle House\nPatty melt with the hash browns\nTryna avoid all the pat-downs\nTryna avoid all the lame hoes\nWeirdos in the background\nBlackout when I back out\nBlow the horn for a pedestrian\nShawty ride like an equestrian\nI bought the dress that she in\nRed bottoms in his and hers\nGot a Rollie in his and hers\nGot a car in his and hers\nWalk in the zoo and say, Pick a fur\nLast night was a blur to me\nThis mornin I got two with me\nI dont know what to do with me\nGoin ape like the zoo with me\nGot a tool with the screw missin\nTwo girls in the pool kissin\nEverywhere I go, the rod with me\nCause these niggas actin too fishy\nFuck yall niggas on, man?\nDuffle bag forever\nJust left V Live\nAtlanta could never die as long as Tit alive\nYeah\nLook, I got a big amount\nI think Im the biggest out\nGot hits and I aint even put em out\nLit and you cant even put it out\nGot the Billboard melodies\nRap is somethin I do on the side\nCrossed over to the other side\nAnd I didnt even have to die\nGot the money and I never show it\nLet a nigga try to play heroic\nMichael Jackson talkin to me in my dreams\nAnd he say, You bad and you know it\nBetter shamone with my check then\nIm a J.

cant even hear myself when I get quiet time\nLike, how they tellin me Im done, when Im in my prime?\nTheyve been tryna push a narrative since 09\nAnd they even had my ass convinced a couple times\nBut that aint even the half, I had tougher times\nOnly look for sympathy inside my mothers eyes\nAnd its whatever with them niggas on the other side\nWe got problems we could never really put aside\nI cracked the door for us all, put my foot inside\nI tried to kill them boys with kindness, but they wouldnt die\nSo now I kill em all for acting like they couldnt die \nMy hard work doesnt just pay off, it pays all the family debts off\nIm taking heads off, Future out here like Irving Azoff\nHouses paid off, label paid off\nMy soul for the money wasnt the trade-off\nUnlike most of you boys that fade off\nI feel guilty taking some days off\nPlease dont google my net worth, the numbers are way off\nI mean, if you comparin it to what I really made off with\nIm more like Bernie with all the earnings that they came off\nTrust me it was nothin light, holmes\nThey tried to give me a slice of the pie, and I took the knife home\nI know you love me\nCant picture bein a hubby, finger too stubby to fit a ring on\nUnless Kawhi wanna run it back\nOther than that, the stringsll be unattached\nCertified Lover Boy, Im not the one for cuddling or none of that\nYall music gets watered down, when you love em back\nAnd you know what Im on, blowing past ya, owning masters\nSaid youre like a father figure to me, but now daddys not around so Im a bastard\nOh, of course, the only villain that show remorse when I owe you more\nSoft spot for all the ones that came before, I cant ignore it\nIm always tryna rekindle\nFrom the bottom to the top, man, whats it like in the middle?\nFrom the lemon faced radio host that love to be bitter\nTo my dogs in the game who wasnt pick of the litter\nFor the young Gs out here starting from the beginning\nNobody praying for you when you winning, dont forget it \nWoah, woah, woah-woah\nWoah, woah\nWoah, woah-woah, woah\nWoah, woah, ah\nSaid its hard when it starts to fade away\nSaid its hard when it starts to fade away\nYeah \nSaid its hard when it starts to fade away\nHard when it starts to fade away\nIts hard when the memories start to fade away\nSaid its hard when the memories start to fade away\n So beautiful\nYeah, yeah, yeah16Embed",

early July\nI called her a bunch of times but she barely replied\nNow its December, Im driving, and shes like Wheres my hi?\nIts weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy\nSee that was a segue, I believe the matter\nIs what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter\nWhere the Timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up\nDrug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up\nWhere girls become exes from Summers caught hoin\nThe winter cars come out, the summer cars go in\nAnd some places is breezy, and some it start snowin\nAnd if you planning family vacations you better know when\nBut some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city\nInstead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity\nCause mom stays up late, she seen them videos\nWhere Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!\nYeah man\nIts a funny thing going through the winter up here man\nA lot of girls yknow, wanna get close\nYou might think they the one\nBut just wait, nah mean, take it slow\nForget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach\nShe lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet\nSince Im driving, I ask her how to get to the suite\nShe doesnt answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat\nShe throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat\nShes bold but I roll with it, Im impressed cause shes sweet\nThen she says I heard your song and Im obsessed with the beat\nI mean, the lyrics are good, but Im obsessed with the beat\nI love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good\nTheres a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat\nOff this Im kinda taken back for a second\nI get her number she tells me to call her after this session\nAnd so I do, and its kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch\nUntil we end up sexin and now my heart attached\nIm thinkin off I shouldve been more Southern\nAnd realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho!\nYeah, uh\nI told yall I had a story for you right\nUh, ya man, its what it is\nAnd now, Im proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench\nShe love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench\nBut, my boy say Im actin different, because I lay downtown\nAnd I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench\nShe tellin everyone Imma hold here down\nTell everyone Im the prince up in this cold clear town\nAnd stupid me I just listen to her\nInstead of wondering if this is really gon last me the whole year round\nBut then Spring shows up, and its Dallas in this bitch\nThe weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed\nWhen we were together, it seeming like way back when\nBall players hop on the plane and make it way back in\nSee she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa\nInstead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana\nAnd its a shame, she had me convinced that she couldve been a dime\nI guess, I lost another one to the wintertime\nI miss you, most of all, my darling\nGive me a second to gather my thoughts\nStrolling in the park \nAnd watching winter turn to spring \nYeah man, you know we had to switch it on em right?\nStrolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing\nIm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss\nMan, but I got something to else to tell ya baby\nI remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up\nNow Drakes committed we waiting on the breakup\nSo we can get back to them cognac nights\nWith dress codes and light skinned girls that wont act right\nAnd I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild\nThe winter came and blew his cold air through\nBack then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her\nBy the end of the week I would know that crew\nAnd wed assembled a trio, a whole new scene\nWith three ladies in the shot we never broke routine\nAt the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin\nWe had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen\nBut this Summer is different its a two man operation\nGranted the fact that we one man short\nGot love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation\nCause handlin crack is a one man sport\nInstead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin\nI find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin\nThe face, the breast, the bras, the toes\nIm still solo and a long night draws to a close\nCause its a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside\nWell never talk again, scary and true\nThat song Special I recorded with Voyce well its like a classified\nIts what Im lookin for to carry me through\nYet I cant seem to find it, every girl that possesses it\nOnly wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit\nAnd when they talk about they past and lovers\nAnd you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others\nYet you find peace with yourself, now least theres some room to ride\nTheres also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive\nStrolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring\nStrolling in the park,

Now after all the talk about how you would show up and never back out\nDrake offered to put three grands on this battle to judge it\nAnd you fucking backed out! Yeah, you little fucking pussy!\nIm in front of DNA, wow! No fucking way!\nThis gotta be my lucky day\nIm about to tie him to a leash in case he tries to fuckin run away\nYeah, the problem with you kids is that you lack respect\nBut fuck me over on money right now\nAnd try to run out and Ima snap your neck\n‘Cause people know\nThat backing out of battles is not part of my plans\nBut you and Cortez always lie, so not to my surprise\nAll your alibis came as a bunch of unauthorized scams\nShit, even if I met you in the middle of the East\nYoud find a way to say that I ran\nBut Im from Los Angeles, Im proud to say that thats my land\nIn L.A. we support our home teams\nWe got a lot of pride, but goddamn\nThe way you ducked me in L.A. proves\nYoull always be more of a fan of The Dodgers than I am\nYou soft as hell, Im not gonna lie, fam\nIn your battle with Rex, you almost copped a right hand\nFrom Dot Mobbs hopping hypeman\nWhen Rex made fun of your retarded mother\nI know you wanted to fight, man\nBut then they called the cameras off\nAnd you walked off and called it a night, damn!\nSort of like when Eminem told you\nLose yourself in the moment, you only get one shot in a life span!\nAnd you answered him, like, I know, Slim!\nThats exactly why Im gonna walk away from this mic stand!\nYour boy Cortez act on some G shit\nWe were supposed to battle here\nHe backed out, like, I need more cash now.\nAnd that is some weak shit; hes a sneaky latino\nSo I wasnt surprised when I came to find out that he skipped\nHe was already flaking like a tortilla\nSo soon as I saw the guacamole on the side with the green chips\nI knew it was only right that that bean dipped\nIt dont matter what battling league you actually be with\nIf you gon be dumb enough to bite the hand that you eat with\nAt least be smart enough\nTo cover up your tracks and dont leave prints\nSomeone call up Smack and tell him to cancel the field trip\nStraps with the beams equipped\nLike an active Marine ready to damage your queenship\nShells battering, the cannon ring until half of your team is seasick\nThe other half starts abandoning ship, panic and leap quick\nIn the same fashion that Hollow took his first chance to get green quick, turned his back on GT\nPacked up his bags, took the cash and then he split\nAnd the faggot hasnt been seen since\nIts all a story that correlates if you go back and you read script\nI use this all as a scenario to reference the battling scene with\n‘Cause GrindTime is the ship\nAnd this is bad as the Titanic sea gets\n‘Cause without Smack you wouldnt be shit but lost talent stranded across the Atlantic sea without a raft to compete with\nI got the long nose like X-Factor\nIll make the back of your Jeep flip\nI said, youd think we were playing Xbox together\nThe way I left half of your screen split\nMy guns are barely legal with magazines thatll make this teen strip\nThats how you like it, right? Come back with a clean flip!\nYeah, Im ready for the drama\nAint no question marks, Ill rip your flesh apart like Jeffrey Dahmer\nLets get it poppin\nIll take the beef and steady chop it like a chef from Benihana\nSpeaking of chefs, shouts out to Cortezs mama\n‘Cause I heard every GrandTime East Coast event\nShe be fixing Poison Pen his empanadas\nSpeaking of him, youd have to pick up the phone and Pen will call ya, ‘cause you too busy slumped over in the bed with Hoffa\nHolding hands with Hollow\nWe all know you were raised by Dutch Vega and Sara Kana\nWhats the beef between us? Its been a never-ending saga\nIll leave you walking around with Benders suppressed persona\nWhen I Sketch Menace your necklace off ya\n deadly waters\nIll throw your body on the stretcher\nAnd let the chopper off, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom-bah-boom-bah\nAnd drop your paramedic helicopter\nI do this for my fans, you mothafuckas aint shit to me\nAre yall kidding me? Im fuckin bum-rushin the enemy\nThese knuckles will leave you bucklin instantly\nI’ll fucking get 10 men to start punching you viciously\nUppercuts will leave your stomach in misery\nLike muscular dystrophy\nThats for thinking you can come online publicly dissing me\nYou can pop your fists while Im still crushin you physically\nThis shit is childs play\nYou get ate side ways like the number infinity\nI said, you need artist development\nBefore you come on the blog and then mention me\nIll stomp you out and make you a part of this history\nDont show me that, ‘cause this is about to be the bodybag of the century! Hold on! Hold on! You mothafuckas aint shit to me\nThey say karmas a bitch, for you its probably dentistry\nBecause the part of your mouth thats missing\nIs only a reflection of whats scarring you mentally\nSo the gap between your teeth\nExists merely as an object of imagery to distract you from the real gap between us—and thats bars and delivery!\nNovember 5th… its ironic, you know, my father died on this day\nAnd I can still remember him telling me\nSon, say what you mean, and mean what you say.\nSee, Im only 20, Diz\nSo in my past battles my emotions might have got carried away\nThats why I flew here to Canada\nTo make sure that wont happen today\nSo when I grip the 9, rip your spine\nMake your body rewind—man, I dont mean that shit\nIll probably never clap the shit out you\nBut trust I mean every word when I say Ill smack the shit out you\nThe difference between entertainment and real life\nLike, remember when I said Ill fuck you up in Vegas?\nWell, dependin on how this battle goes, I still might\n‘Cause, see, I still might\nMove back, move back, what are you doing?\nGettin in my face tryin to go crazy\nTryin to fuck me up when its dead time\nWhen Drakes here in front of the battle\nBut you aint gon make none of his headlines\nWhat I was tryin to say was\nThat the difference between entertainment and real life\nLike, remember when I said Id fuck you up in Vegas?\nWell, dependin on how this battle goes, I still might\n‘Cause me missin a tooth only means\nIve been in a real fight and got real stripes\nSo until you get tapped with a sucker punch and missing yours from an uppercut, then you know what this feels like\nI took this battle for YouTube views, promotion and fanbase\nSo I made sure Im well prepared\nKnowing my name would be buzzin in Sweden\nChina, Switzerland, making them well aware\nSo once I get rid of this storm, and yall see the weather clear\nJust think about the end of every other natural disaster\nYou gone see DNA everywhere\nRemember against A-Class when yall was supposed to go 60 seconds, then on the day of the battle this guy switched it?\nThen remember against Swave you had timed rounds\nBut he said fuck it and you wound up rhymin for 9 minutes?\nThen against me, this guy told Lush, Im rhymin till Im finished.\nWhich only proves further you got a problem with time limits\nSee, you the snake thats tryin to hide your rattle\nWhich only shows the Canadian Quarter\nAint the only bitch that flips when its time to battle\nAnd thats when I realized, hmm\nYou really got a problem with time\nLike when you say youre a terrorist and a hijacker, Im not gettin it\n‘Cause if you detonate a bomb\nWhat you gon set the time to? Unlimited?\nYou really got a problem with time\nI discovered something, Diz, while I was watchin your battles\nAnd nigga, you have never wore a watch in your battles!\nYou really have a problem with time\nIts not opinion no more, its a fact, nigga\nYou do twelve lunchbreaks \nChange times whenever you want with your hat to the back\nWhat the fuck you think you now? Black, nigga?\nYall all know, we really got a problem with time, but fuck that!\nFor the last two years youve been givin me the runaround\nI managed to stay relevant\nWith every battle reaching over 200 thou\nYou done the same, but your musics trash\nSo the industry will never love your style\nWhich makes you a earthquake\n‘Cause you always gone be a disaster that remains underground\nSee, you just an entertainer, Diz! In other words: a fuckin gimmick\nAnd its for so long that the delivery can mask those fuckin lyrics\nYour rhymes are put together sloppy and unorganized\nThats why besides GrindTime we aint fuckin with it\nSo battlin DNA will be the first time his verses have structure in it\nSo when you spit all aggressive with conviction\nI be thinkin that you actually mad\nAnd then understand why you hate us New York niggas\n‘Cause he drive us around all the time in taxi cabs\nLike his rap battle D, hes supposed to be the big bad Dizaster\nAnd when I see DNA, Ima shoot him and let the 5th clap ya\nI said Dizaster, lets fight! – he said Cool, Ima bitch-slap ya!\nSoon as he hopped out the cab\nAll you hear on the radio is Dizaster, its your dispatcher\nPlease go pick up Plex Rock and Lush One\nAnd stay away from DNA, you know you dont bust guns\nYou never touched drugs a day in your life or touched none\nAnd hurry up, your moms calling, rents due, you must come!\nSo when you squint your fuckin eyebrows\nAnd spit with alllll that aggression\nI almost think you might really bust your Glock\nBut then again we saw him against Arsonal\nAnd you aint look too good with that fuckin shot\nYou gon try to rebuttal everything I say\nDont act like you fuckin not, but its cool\n‘Cause a good rebuttal only means I had to say somethin hot\nSo dont be confused when he rebuttal every lyric I say\nAnd think hes clever with frees\n‘Cause every time yall cheer for that great rebuttal\nYou only givin credit to me\nMan, DNA, you are so fucking hood!\nIm gonna rebuttal everything you say?\nGoddamn it, I didnt even know I was that good\nShit, but fuck it, since he wants to talk about time\nThen well talk about time, when I roll up outside and hurt ya\nBut youre DNA, you never click-clack the burner\nYou never commit the murder\nSee, I do what I want with the time limits\nIll just extend them further: this worlds mine, I control time\nThats why they call me the Prince of Persia\nBut you wanna rebuttal too\nI mean, you rebuttald your missing tooth\nBut thats not even a rebuttal topic\nI mean, you wanna rebuttal a missing tooth\nThen make a CD, put out some music, get some money off it\nWait til at least you have one deposit\nGo to your fucking dentist office\nWrite him a cheque with a fucking number on it\nAnd if it makes you feel any better about the situation\nYou can write the word rebuttal on it\nHomie, listen, its been since day one I aint liking you, dude\nWe can go outside right now and Im fighting you too\nIt aint about punchlines, DNA\nIll just display how Im a better writer than you\nSo stop talkin, pay homage, Im spittin\nI solve problems, Im an awesome magician\nThis street magic, Ill make your beef vanish\nLike hot pockets, ‘cause all of you chicken\nI wanna squab with him, but if your squad is honestly trippin\nThat car stoppin, that Glock poppin\nYour top open like Top Ramen before you spark the ignition\nI start boxin, Bernard Hopkins\nYour heart stoppin, Chris Farley condition\nTheres no where to runin an arm bar, caught in submisison\nNow you lost in the mix, got a bunch of hostages with him\nHe tried hoppin the fence, its an impossible mission\nIm camouflaged in the trenches\nReady to penetrate your armys defences\nWith these binocular lenses I have a prophets vision\nIs that the hardest kid in your clique? I got a problem with it\n‘Cause Im the motherfucker, Im what your role model isnt\nIm the armed technician here to remodel your kitchen\nWith a bomb in it, the islamic edition\nPart of your crib gone with the wind, shards of you missin\nCarvin your rib, disarm the opposition\nThen plant the pipe bomb in the car engine\nAnd have Queen Latifah set it off from the distance\nMy job description: I split wigs like a salon beautician\nThat .38 is Special like your moms condition\nI know yall have a problem with the retard jokes\nBut I only use them ‘cause he has something in common with them\n‘Cause when he says hes flippin to mingle\nAnd hes letting the machete spray\nIts not hard for us to see the retarded in him\nI dont give a fuck if yall wanna donate to autism\nThe truth is — cover your ears, Bishop — the truth is your moms not even a good example of what being handicappeds about\n‘Cause shes a master at that wheelchair\nIn that I wouldnt have a doubt\nMost people, getting around when theyre disabled\nThey find it hard, and you live in a massive house\nBut she uses the fucking hallways as interstate freeways\nWhere she gets off at the nearest living room exit\nSo she can take the fastest route\nWeaving in and out of furniture traffic\nShe doesnt even scratch the couch\nBut shes kinda like you in a sense, ‘cause whenever shes stuck in a corner shes really good at backing out\nStop touching me! Yall gon make a rapping discovery\nI dont even know how I can battle you so comfortably\nI still cant even believe this faggots in front of me\nEveryday I wake up and I hit a blunt before I even wash my face up\nThen I think about your genetic make-up\nAnd how we can make up such a fake fuck\nYou pussy you duck hunt  youre getting duct-taped up\nIll kill every faggot in your city, Ill even fuck Mase up\nTheres nowhere to run now, youre on a one-way truck\nAbout to get ran the fuck over over by a fucking one-way truck\nYou little fucking pussy! Your face is vaginal\nYour mouth is like a vagina and in the center it has a hole\nBut fuck a camel though, you have enamel toe\nIts Dizaster, you know I act like a crude jerk\nYour attitude is past faggot, dude\nYou got a gap in your tooth, gagged and you yapped on your new shirt in your battle with Tsu Surf\nI react, Im rollin fast, I let the tool burst\nKids will get hit in ass like the back of a Vatican school church\nI take stacks off packages, this faggot dont move work\nThe only cleaning his gap out\nIs the only time he digs up or actually do dirt\nTwo thirds of his life has been a root canal\nConceited influenced you in style\nEverything you about to do he happened to do first\nYour foundation is missing\nLike the roof of your mouth, that is what you worth\nI would slap this dude around\nBut the fact is life is already battling you worse\nAnd that is reality, I know its sad, but the tooth hurts\nDiz, you aint say one thing hot\nYou still aint say the fuckin truth; Ive been in about 18 battles\nAnd he still gone mention my fuckin tooth\nAnd yall gone cheer ‘cause you think its nice, people\nBut thats wack, ‘cause its shit likes to go to the gap\nLike white people — so why you gon keep freestylin\nActin like you gettin it? Diz, you aint rippin it\nEven your hat knows Im gonna win\n‘Cause its like Cleveland, you gone lose in the end\nThen you wanted to mention my mom being disabled\nThats why I hate that you rap, b\nYou just placed in your rap, D\nMy teeth is missing and I got a face full of acne\nWhen that steel flare\nI bet all of these fans will cheer, like Drake in Degrassi\nPeople are rappin, you must be kiddin me\nIll do you like Pun, have you dead in the middle of little Italy\nThinkin you can spit with me, you aint hot as humidity\nSo why would yall give him props\nFor mention my mom with a disability?\nIll go to your moms house, come through, smack her hard\nCome through, see her right quick, then I snatch that broad\nCatch her right in the kitchen while shes eatin caviar\nAnd put that bitch in a wheelchair out the blue like the Avatar\nAnd this the point, see somethin somethin\nYou think that you so nice, you little old clown\nYou rebuttal half lines, I damn near just rebuttal your whole round\nThis the point where I pin you down and have Organik hold you\nBeat the shit outta you like your pops did when he disowned you\nGive you the same treatment\nThat you did every time you was disloyal\nBut wait, before I do all that, Ima expose you\nRemember what you told Organik about King of the Dot?\nYour league is fucking shitty, bro\nIf you aint gonna give us the help in promotion and gettin dough\nThen why the fuck you attach our logos\nAgainst your bitch-ass videos?\nFuck King of the Dot! We technically invented you\nGrindTimes the prototype, we do what you pretend to do\nI will never respect this chump!\nNow you over here two years later? I guess time flies loud\n‘Cause if you aint notice\nKing of the Dot is shittin on Grind Time Now\nAnd your last three battles been in Canada\nSo this league basically made you, bitch!\nAnd you disrespected them in a battle? You ungrateful bitch!\nYou a faggot, Im just tryna figure out what made you switch\nI guess Grind Time held you down and then raped you, bitch!\nI couldnt wait to get in your face to tell you I hate you, bitch!\nFlew all the way Canada\nTo put you in a wheelchair: Drake you, bitch!\nThey said DNA fell off, well, now Im back — thank you, bitch!\nBut hows his pop rich and you say you struggle, dummy?\nYou take battles for free but gotta pay bills?\nI guess you dont care about no fuckin money\nFor a couple of pennies hell be ready to travel\nSo it makes sense when you ate that sandwich versus SMP\n‘Cause thats the only time you had bread in a battle\nThen you disrespected Jin and his whole race\nBut I bet you if you seen him youd probably switch sides\nAnd dick ride and be pole-dancin\nYou whine and cry about every battle, I bet you have a fit\nThat you dont get your way at your folks mansion\nSo it makes sense why you hate Asians\n‘Cause you always throw tantrums\nAnd everybody knows that battle versus Locksmith\nThat one counted, ‘cause you showed you hated Asians more\n‘Cause when you choked you looked dumbfounded\nBut if thats too low, then turn the volume on your speakers up\nYour rhymes is weak as fuck\nLike the last time Redman and Method Man tried teamin up.\nAnd when he said that line versus Swave\nAt first I was like, Woooh, damn, thats hot!\nUntil Method Man co-signed you\nAnd you just disrespected a legend who gave you props\nAnd then if you talkin like that, then of course hes frontin\nThere aint a course, I get him off for nothin\nThis battles six days after Halloween\nIts ironic, ‘cause he already lost to Pumpkin\nAnd he said, In the MC book, when you fuck up you keep goin.\nAnd in the eyebrow book, you keep shavin if they keep growin\n‘Cause Ima keep it a hundred\nMy tooths missin and them eyebrows is real bushy\nSo King of the Dot, lets keep it a hundred\nOne of us is lyin sayin we get pussy\nWhen I run up on Dizaster in New York with a Knicks hoodie\nHell back down and get scared and get mushy\nOkay, I lied, I see one of us does get pussy\nBut why do you keep on talkin\nWhen you act like you know you off the heat?\nMe, right now? Nigga please!

reason that\nI dont believe in finding the love that I need and\nIm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season\nSo I guess that makes you Aunt Viv\nUntil you take from me till the point that you cant give\nAnd when I see you out I pass by its offensive\nBut what you expect though\nKinda direct yo\nCause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive\nI told ya\nMr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter\nBut she wasnt satisfied with none of the things that I bought her\nAnd wasnt tryna show up none of the places that I brought her\nAnd couldnt utilize none of the things that I taught her\nSo I was just tryna upgrade you\nI aint ya understudy thats tryna upstage you\nI was ya other buddy that tried to front page you\nCrown you\nGet to know the people that surround you\nFunny to think that

approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice\nThey just tell you all the rumors they heard\nAnd we laugh soon as you come and tell me like Amel and Bryce\nMy groove theory is that when you too cheery\nThey try to bring you down to the level they at\nWell when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky\nThats why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap\nBut, uh, they aint thinking Drake get smart, girl\nNah, they probably think Ill break your heart, girl\nHaha, I cant lie, you probably right about it\nAnd if you give me the ass quick, Ill probably write about it\nBut I hate it when they

seven man echo\nYou saying I hustle, my source for currency coke\nThey saying you never moving it and currently broke\nAnd you risk doing crack time and hang around black crime\nJust so you can have something to say in you rap lines\nThey say Drake killed it like young girls at a private school \nDog if I were you, I tell you what I would do\nI would cut ties with the cops and just make them fire you\nLose the body pack and the velcro you feed the wire through\nTell them not to call and thats even if they require you\nCause they the only people recording that wanna hire you \nWith what I spend

She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was Pon de Replay, and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. Its hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called Work.\nToday the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.\nCaptivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, thats often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.\nWhen it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.\nWhats most impressive isnt the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. Whats most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.\nThis woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless its to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasnt changed since day one.\nShes someone, shes someone Ive been in love with since I was 22 years old. Shes one of my... shes one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life Ive looked up to her even though shes younger than me. Shes a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.3Embed", "Thank You Note to 40 LyricsBefore we do this I just wanna say thanks man. Thank you for the years you spent working with some of Torontos true legends honing your craft. Thanks you for dropping everything to work with me after we met and realized we had something special. Thank you for pushing yourself despite the fact you should be resting to achieve an end goal that we are both obsessed with. Thank you for listening to me vent and talking me off ledges. Thank you for talking me out of sending every good song I make to someone else 😂.

least for the time that it took\nWhen you climb and you look\nYou done made it to the clean air\nBreathe in enjoy it cuz some seek joy just to destroy it\nDistorted visions dont playback the way they were recorded\nWhy cant sometimes life be edited minus all the bullshit\nGet a full grip fast forward through the open road\nWhen life push your buttons you dont seem to have remote control\nI hope that your soul is safe\nI hope all your goals in place\nI hope that it goes away and everything just goes your way\nI hope when foes oppose you they get stuck with the frozen face\nI hope I can motivate somebody to grow today\nI hope that you go hard and even though things dont go your way\nHold up wait\nEven though you broke my heart\nIm still wishing you the best\nIm just gonna play my part\nIf someones willing to invest\nThis has been my blood\nThis has been my tears\nThis is been a pain I felt inside my heart for years\nI been workin so hard I know they gotta feel the bars\nThis aint bout no girl this bout the deal I lost\nYeaaa,ey yo check this out\nI like to dedicate this song to…\nAll my failures in life\nEverything that I ever endured that just made me stronger…\nIt made

beautiful\nDont know why I gave my heart, gave my trust\nGave everything, you think that if I had the chance\nTo do it over again\nId do something different, make better decisions\nSave me from my ignorance\nBut I keep making the same mistakes before I\nI see the danger but I go forward\nIm sitting here tryna keep my composure\nKnowing inside Im broken and tore up\nShe got me gone, Im on her like a drug\nI try to go but end up wanting more\nStuck in my head, vivid as a picture\nI wanna be clean but I cant get rid of her\nUh, give my all, you take it from me \nAnd dont even replace it for me \nI wish youd just fake it for me \nI wish I can make you love me more\nYou cant tell I fucks with you, I needed you\nI thought that you understood that based on how I treated you\nI dont pay attention to the rumors that you feed into\nKnow youre missin somethin, I wish I was what completed you\n Damn\nYesterday I fell in love\nToday feels like my funeral\nI just got hit by a bus, shouldnt

could do it, I believed in the naive in you \nI just need to breathe, baby now I got the freedom to\nShes like a drug, yeah\nAnd I dont think I can get rid of her \nCause she got me in this curse \nAnd then it dawned on me\nI cant do nothing with her \nThis womans worth \nI cant find my way out and it hurts \nI tried but she wont let me go \nShe won’t let me go \nShe wont let me go\nShe wont

Lil Romeo must die\nMy last battle was Battle of the Bay 5\nThat was 5 years ago when I was ‘yay’ high\nI feel paranoid on a yay high\n‘Cause with these cameras, this host, and this little pussy…\nAm I on Dateline?\nI could kill you in six seconds: I should just make Vines\nLet’s save time, just say “time!”\nHe’s probably gon say some Asian shit\nAnd pull out shoguns, Peking Duck, Ching Chang Chong\nWait, slow that down, did I accidentally diss you?\nI said pull out yo guns, peek and duck, ching chang chong\nThat shit is easy as fuck, I don’t like to slow it down\nWhen I spit a line, I want y’all to know it now\nYou always over-explain\nThat shit is overly done, ain’t y’all over it yet?\nIronic, the shortest motherfuckers always tryna go over your head\nHow you that small?\nYou look like a male Bratz doll\nYou know I actually auditioned for Wild N Out\nThen I looked in the mirror and said, “That’s not what I’m about.”\nThey had me rhyme in a Chinese accent\nI told em I’m from Korea town\nThen they asked the black guy next to me to wear a wig and a Madea gown, y’all know him as Conceited now\nYou’re a D-list celebrity, I’d rather keep my integrity\nI’d make more money in my sleep while you sleep with the enemy\nI couldn’t have bought my condo with Con dough\nI got Dumb money—and that’s not a pun, dummy\nNow I got young money for the artist fee\nAnd you also got young money for modeling the cover of Carter 3\nLook at his baby ass with his baby tats\nYou buy your guns at Baby Gap\nYour first job, you babysat\nWhen you throw out punches they feel like baby daps\nYour favorite rapper is Baby Bash\nThat’s not a punchline, that’s real… baby facts\nListen here, Dumbfoundead\nNow you going against the hoodie type\nThe gun’ll spit, give you a bunch of tips\nI ain’t talking about good advice\nNigga you ain’t cookin me, the only thing you cook is rice\nAight, which one of y’all Dumbfoundead\nBoth of you niggas look alike\nSo y’all finally put Dumbfoundead in front of me\nThey say you are what you eat\nNo wonder why this cat kept duckin me\nNigga, me and this Chin shoulda been battled\nI woulda served ya and flamed ya\nDont think that the Dot is determined to save ya\n‘Cause they gave me the body I always wanted\nLike a personal trainer\nSo I’ll pull up on that set you rep\nGet your stomach cut without doing sit-ups\nYou better dip, it won’t work out\nIf I spot you with the pounds that I lift up\nWhen the MACs out you ain’t doing squat\nY’all better see Dumb bail when I send this Chin up\nThis kid Dumb is the worst dressed in battle rap history\nI mean I hate your shoes, b\nYou only roll in somethin fresh when you makin sushi\nAnd what you wear doesn’t match\nLike the lips and words in Asian movies\nY’all move y’all mouths a million times for just one word\nAnd it still be off—why?\nThey be like, “...........Hi.”\nThe sound effects never on time either\nIt’s either like kshch or huhhuhkpshpsh\nBut try that kung fu shit with me, I’ma grip the 8\nYou don’t want me to cook your noodle\nWell, get low, mane, like what’s on your dinner plates\nDon’t believe anything this ninja say\nOr one word he spit today\n‘Cause just like your YouTube clip\nWe know everything you kickin fake\nThis nigga’s name is Jonathan Park\nThat’s not a punchline, that’s real facts!\nNo cab when you see an arm wave\nYou can get hit with the knife\nBut a toastll spread when I give Park, K’s\nI’ll show up at your front door with a large 8\nRight where John stay, it’ll be lookin like Monopoly\n‘Cause I got the metal piece at Park place\nYou will get wet—grab a poncho, nigga!\nI point with the 9 like Rondo, nigga\nAnd you gonna hear a lot of steel like I’m a Toronto nigga\nHow you say that kick video was fake? That shit was real\nIt’s as real as you grip the steel\nIf I can’t kick it, yo, your bitches will\nTheres perks to being short, I don’t care what y’all think\nWhen you got small feet, you can get the Jordans all cheap\nWhen you order a shot at the bar, that’s a tall drink\nHe got three hot tubs at the crib, all sinks\nI know these short jokes are getting old\nBut I ain’t even gotta use those\nThey’re just starting to grow on me, but you won’t\nSo I had some of my North Korean homies hack into your emails\nI found some very interesting details\nKeywords like latex, shaved legs, jpegs of Taye Diggs\nAll types of gay shit\nBut I know you ain’t gay, ‘cause you into Asians\nBut yours look like cavemen\nI stay with a bad bitch, what you think is a dime is maybe, ehhh, 6\nLike, if you went to a Thai whore house\nThey be last pick and have dicks\nI get the top hoes at the Brothel\nYou couldn’t reach the top row at a Costco’s\nIt’s impossible, you’re hella short\nYou, Emmanuel Louis, Gary Coleman, Martin Lawrence\nLil Bow Wow, Big Bow Wow, and Kevin Hart\nBlack Hollywood’s seven dwarves\nA bunch of midgets in the woods living large\nYou seem all tough in Hollywood\nBut it’s all an act in the end like Bollywood\nWhen I’m talking K pop, I ain’t talking Gangnam Style\nI’m talking Gangland files\nIn L.A. words can get you killed like a hangman round\nLately the battle scene has gotten Iggy Azalea\nBut I ain’t talking black and white\nI’m talking make-believe and actual life\nHear how you glorifying guns and probly gon have a blast tonight\nThere’s some kid in every major city in America who’s gon get blast tonight\nYou have imaginary guns\nSome people have mandatory ones\nI seen them Wild N Out reruns of you rapping having fun\nThe homie died the other day, the news ain’t ran the story once\nSometimes I think we both forget that we both sell rhymes\nBut hook us up to a polygraph, bet I won’t fail mine\nWith your folktales of dope sales, ain’t no shells flyin\n‘Cause real rounds don’t end when the host yells Time!\nYou and your whole Asian gang, I’ll just use one fist to hit ya\nI’ll put my right hand on that yellow circle: that’s Twister, nigga\nDouble deuce-deuces with these little blickers\nI’ll grip the trigger, you could get shot down by the twins\nMore than Roger in Sister Sister\nI’m quick to grip a Wesson or a 12\nI’ll let the weapon give you hell\nJust like your fortune cookies you can get the message from a shell\nYou cuff your bitch like she in jail, but she give me mad choch\nYeah, you’re part of the Swim Team, I give her back strokes\nShe give me fast throat, and do good when she south\nSince she eat with chopsticks, she should be used to having some wood in her mouth\nBut she has the flattest ass and chest I have ever seen\nShes such a small skeezer\nIf I was you I wouldn’t be wrestling to hit that raw neither\nI mean shes from China, why would you take her?\nNo matter what she rock, nothing big shows\nFrom any angle that John seen her\nThis large nina make sure your nephew and niece are slaughtered\nAnd your aunt may find your uncle been killed like Peter Parker\nNigga, the clip will be on your head, you don’t need a barber\nAnd that shit will “BOW!” like you when you greet your father\nI’ll kick in his door, walk in his home\nStart wavin like I’m finna go\nWhen I’m lickin ain’t no envelope\nI’ma hit your sensei, your grandfather, I’ma kill your folks\nI’ma bring the Maggie to that yellow family like the Simpsons show\nY’all niggas know I’m gonna sling him\nThem 9’s I’ma bring him\nAnd I bring the war to Park like Wild Water Kingdom\nI’m bringin the heavy can\nAny problems, I’ll let the semi blam\nIf things go south, Park, soon as you walk I’ll\nMake sure you get caught, man, how can he stand?\nY’all catch that? Kyle, Cartman, Kenny, Stan?\nMan, that’s why this chinky hates me\nIf it’s problems I’ll get the shit jumpin like Mr. Hanky\nNow lastly they told me\nBy the looks of his eyes he might be sleepin on you\nSo I better come with it, I should be scared of his freestyles\nAnd be horrified of Dumbs writtens\nHad me like, “Shit, in this battle, Dumbfoundead gonna cook and eat me…” nah, just kiddin\nSLOW IT DOWN! I JUST DISSED YOU!\nI said, Dumbfoundead gonna cook and eat me? Nah, just kittens\nHAHH!!!\nI’m opening up for Pat Stay and Charron, shake my head\nI started this nerdy shit, this the motherfuckin thanks I get?\nI get the club going up like iLoveMakonnen\nYou get in the club droppin names like, “I’m with Nick Cannon.”\nHe rocks expensive shit and licks his lips, LL Cool J over here\nDifference is you’ve been rappin about dudes your whole career\nBy the way, what’s all that shit on your neck?\nWhat’s all that shit mean?\nOh, I get it, we all make mistakes when we’re fifteen\nThis is where me, Tunechi and Wiz link\nWe got grown-man tats, lil tyger, that shit is kid ink\nHow much work could they done on you?\nMatter of fact, that’s the only time you’ve had a gun on you\nRatatatat butterflies on your back\nAnd some Chinese letters that don’t mean jack\nEvery battle you do is a short film\nOh, you got unlimited ammo?\nDoes that mean I could have force fields?\nDoes that mean I could have orcs, swords, shields\nA giant hammer that Thor wields?\nDoes that mean I could have orbs, pills\nPotions to level up more skill?\nJust ‘cause you talk about guns doesn’t make it more real\nYou’re a dork still!\nWhile you and your crew were playin Gangster: The Gathering\nI went on a couple dates with your family\nMet his mama on Tinder, thought we had something special\nI leaned in to kiss her\nShe said “SLOW IT DOWN! I JUST MET YOU!”\nSo I holla’d at his auntie, real polite, real respectful\nI thought she’d want me\nBut she said: “SLOW IT DOWN! THAT’S MY NEPHEW!\nMy last resort was his sister, I knew I’d be successful\nI was like, all aggressive with it, like, “Let me hit it!”\nShe said: “SLOW IT DOWN! I’MA LET YOU!”\nIt’s funny how you think Organik is your friend\nBut he’s just exploiting you, he’s like Nick Cannon at the end\nYo, but after this, I may never have to battle rap again\nBut you, you’ll be back up here again\nBattling with him, battling with them\nBattling with enemies, battling with friends\nWait, what’s your name, sir? Jim? You’ll be battling with Jim!\nFor you, it’s a never-ending battle and the battle never ends\nThe end.\nWe was supposed to battle 2009 in Grind Time\nWith the bars you ran, so what we need relay for?\nYou was pissed, I was buzzin\nIf we battled, you would be a corpse\nSo that shows I been made John mad in ’09 like EA Sports\nI mean I thought you would sign a deal\nYou mad ‘cause my views are climbin mills?\nI know that shit was drivin him crazy\nLike when you behind the wheel\nI shoot and fire steel that’ll pop at ya\nAnd I light 8 sticks like it’s Hanukkah\nJust to get you capped like a yarmulke\nThat erase this mark like a swastika\nI load and flash steel: that’s photographers\nAnd the can it’ll cap it all like Ottawa\nYo, I’m boxin ya, if we brawl up in this place\nYou’ll get knuckles all up in ya face\nAnd your head be knocked-off like the Jordans that y’all make\nSo y’all go and gave me this Chino in TO\nWho eats soup named miso, and he’s called a hero?\nNigga, I will take every dollar you got if your gwap got zeroes\nLike that movie they was shooting, Heat\nAl Pacino’s in the cast and Rob De Niro\nSLOW IT DOWN! I JUST DISSED YOU!\nI said we’re shooting heat\nI’ll put Chinos in a cast and rob dinero\nYou take this Asian pride shit so far\nYour favorite battle rapper is probably Math\nI mean there’s nothin left to talk bout\nYou’re so Asian, when you get hungry, you argue with your girl on purpose so she can put you in the dog house\nYou take this Asian pride shit so far, you probably love Ryu\nAnd your second favorite battle rappers Tsu Surf\n‘Cause he puts his rhymes in subtitles\nI should let the snub light you right now\nYou’ll let the pipe blaow? Nigga, pipe down!\nYou ain’t got the Magnum for protection to pop Con, Dumb\nIt’s not in your lifestyle\nI need you to tell me right now\nWhy do you use “R’s” instead of “L’s” when you speak?\nHe be like, “Herro! My favorite rapper is Ril Wayne.”\nI mean, now that’s the truth, I ain’t racist\nI don’t know if that’s somethin you do ‘cause you’re Asian\nBut in this battle I’ll give you a L so you can use it in your language\nThat Ruger get to bangin\nPut you in your place if you comin for Con dough\nGo realer with the bananas\nFor the monkey business wherever Con go\nWhy would you think a 9 would miss?\nBullets have no name, but they still comin for John though\nY’all know S.O.N.S. created a lane for any battler that has bars\nEven when you Asians will break\nAnd somebody down and killin em, that’s ours\nNo, when you Asians will break\nAnd somebody down and killin em, that’s SARS\nSo even if he did say he’ll burn me like ether when he busts guns\nThese blickers kick back like 3 Ninjas\nYou Rocky?

"Try Harder Lyrics\nSometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough\nTo feel what Im about to say in this song\nWhen they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself\nAnd you do it and get the feeling its wrong\nThat there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get to snapping\nAnd they try to make you out as a lie\nIts ironic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason\nIts a lose lose why even try\nWhen your ideas so frequently get rejected\nPeople just get neglected\nAnd they never really know how to feel\nPhone calls is something that youre expecting for someone without the ethics\nAnd the motives to try and make them a mill\nYou never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and\nThey just wanna say that you aint around\nI mean theres always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming\nThat you couldnt help and maybe next time you aint in town\nYou gonna try to try harder cuz\nTry harder cuz\nTry Try-Try-Try\nAnd the managers make you succumb to pressure and if what you spittin is fresher\nThan most of these rappers running the game\nCertain people will copy whats in the past to turn the profit with cash\nTheres time I would have done it the same\nI mean I got me a Range\nAlso got me a guilty conscience\nThat made you tell anybody I meet that I rent\nSometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers\nAnd watched the game from the bleachers\nBecause Im really tend to need what I spent\nIn a house that I promised to get my mother dont compensate for the other time\nI wasted out late at the club\nInstead of sitting in once a week for some dinner Im working hard on the winter\nSo this album is a labor of love\nYou say as long as Im staying out of the streets and just spending money on beats\nThat she can rest without a toss and a turn\nBecause she know that my reputation precedes me and people watch me on TV\nThats exactly why I often get burned\nBut Im gonna try to..\nYou gonna try to try harder cuz\nTry harder cuz\nTry Try-Try-TryEmbed", "Do What You Do Lyrics\nI do this for yall man\nMalice,

Lets take his shoes.\nWe got older, put mother and daughter in a sacred room\nOne live, one die nigga, make em choose!\nFuck it, kill yourself for all I know\nI point that can at her, that big boy is Ontario\nBut there aint no where to run though\nNow that was a reach, I aint gon lie\nBut Im reaching for another gun pronto\nDrake Started From The Bottom beat, you gon get it from Mahalo \nSee, we all know a whole bunch of shit that you could say about me\nIf I was you, Id have all my shit took away\nYou could say\nBig T, what you know about studying for a test thats a month away?\nYou had to go to school, your dad made you read a book a day\nThe whole book a day\nNo Bs, you only could get As\nCause if you didnt get good grades you got all your privileges took away.\nYou could be like, Big T\nWhat you know about being mad when McNabb couldnt play\nCause if it was a mistake my dad used to beat my mom ass and I had to look away.\nLike, He didnt mean to fumble that last play it was a mistake.\nAll you hear is {bbbbbrrr bbbbrrr clap clap} Leave her alone dad for goodness sakes!\nWhat you know about Adam having the same face as mine\nCause Im Adam junior and hes Adam senior he had the same face as mine\nSo if I lose the disgrace is mine\nSo first place was mine cause you had somebody there to motivate you every time\nI wouldnt know about that\nQUIET nigga!\nYo check\nSo I worried theyd paint me simply\nIf fat jokes were all Id bring for T\nBut hes the first really fat guy Ive battled so...this is big for me\nI mean, these fat jokes are mad heavy\nYall might get mad at me\nShit, I might lose all my fat friends, oh wait I dont have any\nSo if regular fat people wear big tees with their bathing suits\nYou take the next level and probably bathe in suits\nI mean Id clown him about his outfit but his face looks like its drowning\nYou dont have a lazy eye you have a lazy face around it\nYou look like the Teflon Don if he was covered in Teflon\nOr a walrus who dipped all of his blubber in Exxon\nFuck a bug, hes killed any mammal hes stepped on\nIf Biggie saw this piggy he would think he was Dead Wrong\nI mean as far as food, what we got today?\nLobster face? Pasta plate?\nHes black and Islamic, what the fuck is he? A chocolate shake/sheik\nI mean, youre too fat to walk over subway grates\nBut youre in the hall of fame with Jared as the Subway Greats\nI mean, fucking your blood pressure is higher than the price of a brick\nYou are addicted to steaks if were talking life on the strip\nWe would need a whole tray to put ice on your wrist\nAnd your fingers are too fat so you fucking type with a stick\nBut fuck jokes, Ill use reality to show that theyre lame\nThe joke would be you probably need two seats whenever you sit on an airplane\nThe reality would be if you sat next to on me an airplane it wouldnt ruin my night\nIt wouldnt ruin my flight\nIt would ruin my life!\nHim coming down the aisle with hard steps and short breath Please God do not let him sit here Id be praying with palms clenched\nSit down and your drenched from your breast to your forehead Fuck two seats, lard fest could only fit on a park bench\nIn case of emergency landing hed need an extra large vest\nIf he has the window seat, the suns eclipsed by your chest\nAnd Id be hard-pressed to stay Meta like Artest\nBecause this guy cant keep his side fat off of the armrest\nI mean...\nI mean its a tight nice little package but I promise all thats real\nYou are inconvenient to be around, how awful does that feel?\nI mean...\nI mean his gains could be alleviated\nAnd his pains could be abbreviated\nWith a diet and exercise maybe tying to be creative\nIts really basic but the only time hes creative\nIs making tacos with ice cream as a freaking meat replacement\nHes got a million ways to sweeten cakes\nBut not one way to lean his face in?\nAlways room for cheese and bacon\nBut let me guess, the greens were taken?\nBut people treat it like its a disease a sickness to be mediated\nMisleading statements from the media they deviate it\nLike its fat shame and I cant take it\nIm trying to decrease your weight and that benefits you\nSo you could show some appreciation\nI mean that fact that youre fat\nSays so much about you as a man\nNo long term goals, no perseverance, you cant stick to a plan\nYou only care about yourself, youre stuck in your selfish ways\nAnd none of your family members care enough about you to help you change\nBut they say, Big Ts the man like thatll help him magically\nOh course youre the man dawg, you motherfucking have to be\nYou have to be cool or funny just to get an advantage\nOtherwise you wouldnt have a single friend on this planet\nI mean, I mean, fucking...\nFat people make less money, they get promoted less\nTheyre more likely to be alone or suffer an early death\nAnd I get pissed cause you have kids and your children are gonna grow\nAnd its a tragedy cause being fat is all that theyll ever know\nWhen your daughter was born you probably weighed 355 pounds\nIf you walked a mile a day since then, hed be skinny by now\nSo I dont give a fuck if I lose today or fucking lose the race\nBro you cant win at life until you fucking lose the weight

I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J.

I completely support and agree with Rolling Stone replacing me on the cover with the legendary Phillip Seymour Hoffman. He is one of the most incredible actors of our time and a man that deserves to be immortalized by this publication. My frustration stemmed from the way it was executed. The circumstances at hand are completely justifiable , but I was not able to salvage my story or my photos and that was devastating. They ran the issue without giving me a choice to be in it or not. I would have waited until it was my time because I understand the magnitude of the cover they chose but I just wasnt given that option and that made me feel violated. I apologize to anybody who took my initial comments out of context because in no way would I ever want to offend the Hoffman family or see myself as bigger than that moment. I am still the same person. Today I was forced out of my character and felt the need to react swiftly. These days are the worst ones. Waking up after a great night in the studio and its your day to be picked apart. After dwelling on it for a few hours or days you will come to the conclusion that you brought it on yourself almost every time. So here I am having that moment.

No? D-Did he steal a stack? No…\nOh, he took too long to release the Conceited match\nYou cheeky twat! How dare you repeatedly bite the hand\nThat helps feed ya fam\nWhen he was the owner of the only league that let you compete for cash\nThat man took you from a dirty piece of shit\nTo a featured brand with a sea of fans\nI’m talking before your hairline receded back\nAnd had a teeny chance of making an NBA season draft\nHe’s the reason you can afford them red leather sequinned pants\nAnd Showwoutt’s fee to do a remix dance\nTalking about\nTalking about where’s Norbes, Cheeko, and Beasley at\nYou need appeasing and someone needs to see to that\nShut the fuck up! Miss us with that diva act\nThe damn truth is youre Frank Lucas\nWe wouldn’t know you exist if it wouldn’t have been for Smack, but...\nYou, you said if they release Arsonal first, it’s on the flag and rep of ya people\nWell, they did that and you did nothing, so that was very deceitful\nWhen you said you was gonna shoot on blood\nLil Gerald that never will be\nIf he shoots on B’s then that’s Resident Evil\nMe and Arsonal did 6 million, you must act like I ain’t contributed to the hits\nWell you and Arsonal did half them numbers in twice the time\nIf you don’t understand that then you stupid as shit\nThat means there was a 100% increase when they added me\nAnd removed you from the mix\n3 Million … Drake I can’t see him with these Views From The 6\nThats my second round in \nMan I put niggas to sleep, automatic or handguns\nEverybody I clap throws off, Conceited slow that down\nAutomatic or handguns, everybody I clap dose off\nThey sent them contracts, I’m like yeah, it’s grind time\nBut to keep it real I was ready before I signed mine\nThey told me, switch up and joke, nah that’s Grindtime\nI’m more of the “you’ll get choked” a ticking time bomb\nA football star, you can ask, I was Moss like\nCould switch to that mask and ratchet, the lacrosse type\nAnd if I get mad, I spaz like\n“I need everything he made back, I’m the rawest type”\nI’m coming for the belt, who got it? Tell em he’s next\nThe K Shine, it ain’t nothing but Murda, ask T-Rex\nWhen I look at Shotty, naw, I don’t see threat\nYou was supposed to battle Verb and Ill, and I’m ya final destination?\nYou see all that prove is you can’t cheat death\nI got a Navy Seal connect, man this shit loud\nThe weapon he just plug me with about his size\nIt’s war, you run with ya squad, you never switch rides\nYou get sliced down the middle for not picking sides\nThey got me back on that wild shit\nKnock, knock, knock, who is it? Kidnap his child shit\nPow pow shit, that 40 or that Cal shit\nShotty watch ya mouth, I’m not the one to get loud with\nThat shit I just did, that’s an effortless move\nYou Golddust looking motherfucker, you just put me in a wrestling mood\nIf I decide to bomb first, best believe Ima land mine\nI ain’t scared of no nigga, that boy was from Mankind\nThree 2 minute rounds for what? That’s the long road\nI could’ve beat you with 3:16’s that’s Stone Cold\nA million views every battle is easy, that’s a simple trait\nThat’s why I’m Hitman “Hollywood” Holla, that’s Triple H\nWhere I’m from niggas get clapped up in the lobby\nThe army has been instructed to catch bodies\nThe officers killing my race like it’s a hobby\nIn other words ain’t shit horror about Shotty\nFor 25K Mook could kill a nigga that’s ill\nMan for that 10k I’ll kill this nigga for real\nYou came to talk about balls, and that shit’s so gay\nThe console its sold separately, meaning I ain’t with those games\nYou trying to bring back the old Holla\nYou need more than tank tops and big rope chains\nYou need the fire and skill plus the desire and will\nAnd a sponsorship with Rogaine\nI’d a killed you when you were ya lil bros age\nFor the record I’d a MOP’d that Billy dance for a lil Fame\nMOP, Billy Danze, Lil Fame, switch the lane\nSpill his brains, when that Shotty’s in his face, this shit’s Cobain\nI’d shoot the hair off Holla’s head, trust I got that killer aim\nTwo hands steady the beam, they support the dot like Drizzy Drake\nWhat’s real to you? Basketball or a gangbanger? Pick that shit\nAin’t no such thing as half way crooks Gerry, and you ain’t with that shit\nSplit personalities, persona disorder, you see how quick man flip\nAye let’s just say it’s JFK, there’s still questions about who that Hitman is\nBut I have a question, and I hope you have the answer to it\nIf battle rap’s a cappella why you always dancing to it\nFuck bars, you and Aye Verb spend your time\nTrying to plan the coolest hand maneuvers\nYou almost did a YMCA just to tell me about a strap you’re using\nFuck you think this is? Fuck you think this is, though?\nFuck you think this is? I ain’t playing Hitman game\nNow bald headed white boy shoots and\nEveryone’s in black suits like the Hitman game\nURL King Of Performance, uhhh let me throw the debate in\nI think Roc took ya spot like Coke in the 80’s\nI’m in the Dot again\nI’m in the Dot again\nDeep Waters just passed me the strap in case I actually need it\nSo if I have to act like an idiot it’d be more clapping and screaming\nThen you and Showwoutt after a remix\nIt’s Horroh, It’s Horroh, the one that brought a Tom in Gerry’s house\nTo put holes in every wall like Tom & Jerry’s house\nBut his chick saw em, she let me knock out on the couch\nI ain’t rob her, but she still had the Shotty in her mouth\nYour chick loves that hard white, not the coco\nBut tonight I will be over your bird like the sponsors logo\nWhat? I will be over your bird...\nIm meant to believe the plasticine gangster theme?\nIm meant to believe you’re in the banda with a strap in each hand as you’re trapping keys?\nRapper please, you’ll be shook in the suburbs\nProbably get robbed by a gang of geeks\nI mean he walk in a white hood and stay quiet, well that’s Assassins Creed\nWhat’s big money to small change?

Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something.\nIts impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues.\nThis is real and Im concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step.\nMy thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence.\nBe safe out there.

This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry, and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed muchEmbed", "The Notice Lyrics\nEvery night its all the same\nPoppin bottles for them bitches, gettin faded\nIm happy you noticed\nHouston numbers but sometimes﻿ I want a little conversation\nI think its time for somebody to notice\nThat this life is overrated cause Im meant\nFor something realer than a good time getting faded\nShe just wanted someone to notice that her hair\nNails did and for somebody to notice that she bad\nI havent seen you in forever its been ages\nYou aint aged a bit\nStill the same woman you was back in 06 damn swag\nStill so cold, we so throwed, how you been?\nIve been fine, hows your son?

supposed to come on the show, it didn’t happen but we connected the day after and did a legendary interview in Hyde Park. I said it felt like you’re gonna make history\nIt’s been a while, that’s kinda how we ended up here. When I got here , I was just like in my room, just tryna find my lineage of coming to London and just trying to figure out where it all started. And I just watched that Hyde Park interview and I’m watching this kid, it’s me but to me it’s just a kid that’s just trying to talk, trying to answer questions in the best way possible. Just the fact that we were just walking around, just me, you, a microphone and a camera. I was like “man I should hit Semtex up, man we should talk again”. I feel like that was a good conversation, we covered a wide spectrum of things and I think it’s been a long time since somebody’s been able to sit down and do that with me, and that’s how we’re here\nHow’s it feel to go from doing mixtapes, So Far Gone was the mixtape that really broke, before that Lil Wayne mentioned you in an interview with me, and I started following you and it’s just grown. From there you’ve been non-stop, its crazy…\nYeah that was an amazing time for all of us… still doing it with the same people. It was just… our landmark for that project is 15 Fort York, which was “40” and Oliver’s apartment and we really started that project there. Then it moved to the Beverly Hills Hotel in LA, when we were first just getting around Wayne, I know Wayne mentioned me in the interview, but the real turning point for me was when Wayne went on stage at the MTV awards and rapped one of the verses from ‘Money To Blow’. Instead of doing his own verse he just impromptu rapped one of my verses. And at that time, people are like, people from back home who really didn’t….. I mean it was just a tough thing to believe like, “I know he says he’s over there but is he gonna come home with a Lil Wayne record, is this gonna really happen” at that time people were like “ok he just rapped Drakes song, if he gets a Wayne record this is outta here”\nThat was when I was able to come back off those trips with Ransom. I went back home with Ransom, which was the first time I had ever got a Lil Wayne verse. From there I had a bunch of songs that I had recorded at the studio called Hot Beats and Wayne just got on all of them like ‘Stunt Hard’ and ‘Forever’ was one of them, early early. Then we started crafting that first project and using the input of two people who again I still work with to this day and my music wouldn’t be what it is without them, that’s Oliver and ‘40’ – you know it’s funny cos we’re sitting here talking and they’re back in Toronto executive producing ‘More Life’. Oliver’s executive producing it and ‘40’ is obviously always involved, but kinda just a full circle moment for us, cos Oliver had so much input on ‘So Far Gone’ so I was like “man it would be nice to do something with me and you again”, so I gave him that task and he’s at home piecing it together. So yes it was a great start and from there it just became a wild journey that I guess we’ll talk about\nA lot to talk about – ‘More Talk’…\nSince we’re right at the beginning, I was in Amsterdam with Lil Wayne….and he tells me – Yo he’s been writing on ‘Detox’ that was like the mythical album, you gotta be about your business to be involved in that, or to be in the studio. How did you end up from doing a tv show to working with Dr Dre, writing for him on Detox? It’s taking it back…\nIts taking it back, I’m not usually that good with the ‘taking it back moments’ but I actually remember this one vividly. But yeah, I was on the show and while I was on the show, I started getting less and less character time, because of the fact that everybody was taking a notice to just the fact that I was more focused on music. And at the time I actually had a studio that was right by the film studio for Degrassi, so I ended up working out a deal with the after hours staff where I would leave work, go home get my stuff – Degrassi was all the way in the east end, which is Scarborough that’s like an area of our city. I’d go home all the way back to the city, get my stuff, come back to the studio, I would record and around 4/5am I would sneak back into Degrassi, they’d let me in and I would go to sleep in my dressing room. Eventually they found out what I was doing and they got really upset. During that time I was crafting all these songs, and I had a song that Omen produced – it was me and Mickey Factz and somebody else was on it I think. So Dre had heard the song and he had hit me like, “man I need proof that you wrote this” , so I had to fax him the lyrics of the song, I had to send him a fax message, from my moms fax machine in her bedroom I sent him a fax\nYou know at that time, Detox was going on, it was more like he had just a camp of people, I guess churning out ideas and just trying to spark something. I was flown out to record at Record One, which is a legendary studio. Yeah I was in there for a while, I did a lot of work, me and ‘40’, always brought ‘40’ with me, that was like a stipulation in my career, I wouldn’t move without ‘40’, so brought ’40’. Got to meet a lot of great people, obviously got to work with Dre, and it kinda all came to an end, when I.. Dre brought me into his office and said “Man you’re doing really good work” and he gave me a $10,000 cheque, and it was the most money I’d ever had in my life and at the time I was in a relationship. So I got the money and I called my girl, and I flew my girl down to L.A and was like “we can get a hotel this is crazy”, it was just a joyous moment for me. And I had missed studio or I had done something wrong, I had let my mind deviate from work and I had missed something, and next thing I know I was sent home and that was kind of it. It was a huge life lesson for me and I still have that… Actually when Dre came out at the Forum, I brought him the $10,000 cheque cos I had saved the actual hard copy of it, even though I got the money for it, they let me keep a copy of the cheque\nSo yeah that was kinda my dealings with that very early on, and I had heard rumblings, like oh all these people are here and I had met Snoop, and I kinda wrote this song, that ‘40’ still has somewhere for Dre and Snoop. We listened to it not to long, couple years ago, its kinda hard. But yeah it was a great experience, a great learning experience for me and ‘40’, it brought us closer and it just taught us about how this shit really works and I think that set us on our own path\nSo lets fast forward to 2015/2016, VIEWS one of the most successful albums, the tour you did in America was the most successful tours. How do you feel about what you achieved with VIEWS and the reaction? It’s a very pivotal point for you, going from writing for Dre and being on a TV show all the way up to …\nYeah I mean, it was one of those moments in my career, where the album started to build and build and build and you know when anticipation starts to build, it can either result in massive failure or massive success. Obviously somebody’s watching over us and it resulted in massive success for us and it was also just an opportunity for me to really take a lot of risks that I felt I was ready to take at that moment. And yeah, I mean I was obviously very proud of it from the title to the cover, to just the styles of music that I felt we introduced almost as a package. It kinda started with ‘Work’ because ‘Work’ came out before my album, and then progressed into ‘One Dance’, ‘Controlla’, ‘Too Good’. But just the style of music that was making me happy at the time, because to be completely honest with you I was having trouble figuring myself out in rap at that time I was a very defensive individual just coming off the situations that I’d come off of. I was having trouble trying to make rap music where I was able to peel back the layers and every time I’d make a song – ’40’ is always really bluntly honest with me and was like “Man you really sound like aggressive and defensive” – and I was just trying to figure out why and I realised it was just a reaction to my previous situation that had kinda happened before that\nSo there was a time where I actually thought about taking the rap off of VIEWS and just making it an album full of music that made me happy with melody. But obviously I know why I’m here, I know who my core fanbase is, and so towards the end of the album, I tried to execute it as best as I could, on the rap end. You know I still listen to the bars and I know exactly where I was at and they are great to me, and they are time markers to me, but yeah, I guess we’ll get into ‘More Life’ after and how that situation progressed. But yeah VIEWS for us was, it was surreal, the numbers and all the things we were able to achieve, it was an incredible time for us. And of course in true OVO fashion we didn’t celebrate it all, we just kinda went on to working on the next thing. That was kinda it, it was just another album to us, it wasn’t my biggest album by any means, it wasn’t the one to me, it was just another chapter in the story but I’m very grateful for the people who enjoyed it and supported it. Whether people want to admit or not, the influence that it’s had on music, I feel is very evident, whether people don’t wanna say it\nDid you know what you were doing when you made ‘One Dance’, Kyla’s on there, Wizkid is on there, it’s a truly global records, because I think very few people have done what you’ve done with mixing everything with the US, the UK and African sounds. Did you know how big it was going to be, it was the song of the year\nIt really all started with the Kyla record, it was just a song that I had played, we Dj at our own parties just because …\nHow did you discover it though, that’s like a UK underground Funky Sound…\nI mean I just listen to a lot of music and I have friends with great taste in music, so I’ve been personally putting that song in my own playlist and DJ set for like four/five years now, I know it’s older than that, even just playing it and having people… What really set something off for me was having people in America come up to me and be like “Yo what was that song you just played?” and I would be like “man people really like that song but they don’t know it”. So I just, my brain started working of like how could I utilise a bit of it, there’s so many good pieces. So I introduced the concept to ‘85’ and I said to him like “man if we could make a beat, I don’t wanna do a cover I wanna write a whole new song, I just want Kyla to serve as the bridge or as a bridge to the next verse, or as a bridge to the next hook”, and he was like “alright alright cool”\nI had the beat for a while, I was just trying to figure it all out, and at that time I had met Wizkid through Skepta, cos we did a remix of one of Wizkid’s songs together and it just kinda all really fell into place naturally. And when it was all said and done, it was one of those moments much like ‘Hotline Bling’, I just didn’t really know how people were gonna feel about it, and that was part of the reason why I dropped ‘Pop Style’ along with it, cos I was kinda almost nervous like man I don’t know, this is just so different, let me just make sure I drop a rap record, so people just know I’m still on my shit. And I remember Boi1da had walked into the studio one night and he had heard ‘One Dance’ and he just looked at me and he’s like “man that’s gonna be the biggest song of your career to date” and I was like “c’mon man it’s like, that’s a lot to say, we hope it does well”. And yeah he was right, and it was just the perfect marriage of a lot of things, so many thank you’s to Kyla for being so supportive, she came out to South Africa and shot a movie with us for this song, and you know of course Wizkid doing his thing, and yeah just the entire UK for supporting it and the world for being open to listening to it\nI love that tempo, I love that cadence, those melodies, that’s the music that makes me happy in life, so it was great to just be able to just make something like that and shine light on a song from the UK that deserves it, because that’s truly a classic song\nWith ‘Pop style’ what happened with that, because when I got it originally it was Jay-Z and Kanye on it and they kinda weren’t on it?\nYeah, I was dealing directly with Ye and that’s the version that he sent me and that was what we talked about and he was like “man you know this is like ‘Pop Style’ featuring the throne, this is huge” and I was excited obviously anybody would be excited to see them link back up. And then I didn’t know what I was gonna hear. So when I heard Jay had two bars, I was like alright it is what it is, it’s cool I like that, it’s a little intro and Kanye goes off. And then you know I’m not really sure the details between how that conversation was miscommunicated or what they were going through at that time, or what anybody felt towards me or whatever it was, I’m not really sure but next thing I knew it just became a bit of an issue. And you know from there I don’t waste too much time, so I just was like alright cool I’ll finish it, I can rap as good as anybody else, so I’ll just go finish this song and put forth my own version cos I don’t really like… you know no one can dangle anything over my head in this business, I don’t play that. So it just needed to be done and I did it myself and yeah both versions exist, so when Kanye comes out to do it at the shows it goes crazy. I know he was really upset cos at that time we were working together pretty heavy and he really wanted to be on the record but you know…\nOn the Pablo tour, he said a lot of things that are well documented but he said, before the last show, he was talking about how he was sick of not being able to do certain things everyone should come together and just make music. Is it digital politics now that prevents things from happening?\nI don’t know, I think everybody has their own little things going on, I’m not really sure what he’s referring to half the time, cos in the same breath, I went from being… like working on a project with him, to him sorta publicly shitting on me and DJ Khaled for being on the radio too much. But yeah I’m not really sure, everybody’s got their own thing going on. Again me when I hear that, I just distance myself from it you know, alright if that’s what it is I don’t really even understand the point you’re trying to make but whatever it is that you’re going through, I accept it, I don’t respect it at all. You know cos I feel like me and Khaled are just good people, I’m not sure why we’re the target of your choice that you made that night. And yeah I accept what you’re going through, and I just go and continue working on my own thing. You know the more and more this progresses, the more and more I just feel like keeping to myself, cos its just so unpredictable, you never know which way people are gonna go. I mean streaming is the new record business, so yeah I guess you could call it digital politics, that’s kinda a good name for a song, I might have to do that when I get upstairs\nSo with ‘Childs Play’ another banger, there’s a line on there where you say why you acting light? What does that mean?\nOh you mean “I’m acting like I’m light skin”, that line , that’s just sorta something people… that’s like very an American thing people say like ‘ah man’ you’re being light-skinned”, I guess they say it’s like ‘emotional’ you know. I just think it’s a ridiculous stereotype, but I was just kinda playing on the irony of it, cos I’m actually light skinned so it made me laugh so I said it. But yeah it’s just a silly stereotype in black American culture, that light-skinned guys are this way or that way, so that was just a little joke\nWhen did you first experience racism, you’re coming from a dual heritage, your fathers black, your mothers white, it puts you in a predicament, when was the first time you really noticed you get it from both sides, or one side or the other?\nMan you know, I’ve really been grateful in my life to be born in Canada and just the journey that I had growing up was so… it was just a very accepting journey. I always had friends from all different backgrounds, from different walks of life, we all get along, I never really notice colour, religion, we don’t live like that. There’s really not that much segregation in Canada, and especially in Toronto, it’s like a cultural mosaic. And I know I’ve said that time and time again, but it truly is, it’s made up of so many beautiful people from beautiful places and you get to actually learn and you don’t ever develop hate. You know, the first time I really experienced it, was when I got famous and went to America and people would challenge me, like I don’t understand how it works or like “your Canadian, you’ll never understand, like the Black American struggle, or you’ll never under…..” That was the first time I really got challenged, and it was by people I had met from America that were like even close to me at the time\nYou know, if I ever feel anything or if I ever feel like an outsider, it’s usually because I’m not American to be honest with you, that’s when I feel like people are against me or they feel like I’m not part of the…. I guess it’s got something to do with the fact that I have quite an eclectic make up, I am mixed, I am Jewish. Yeah but I feel like, at the end of the day when it comes to everything else I’m Black. I am referred to as a Black artist, last night at that Awards show, I’m a Black artist. I’m apparently a ‘rapper’ even though ‘Hotline Bling’ is not a rap song. The only category that they can manage to fit me in is a ‘rap’ category, maybe because I’ve rapped in the past, or because I’m Black, I can’t figure out why. Just like I can’t figure out why ‘One Dance’ wasn’t nominated, maybe because they can’t… I mean, well it’s just there’s pop obligations that they have and I fluked out, I fluked out and got one of the biggest songs of the year that is a pop song and I’m proud of that, you know. I love the rap world, I love the rap community, but you’re right I write pop songs for a reason, I wanna be like Michael Jackson, I wanna be like artists that I looked up to, those are pop songs but I never get any credit to that\nAnd shout out… and by the way I’m speaking to you as a winner from last night, I won two awards last night, but I don’t even want them, cos it feels weird for some reason, it doesn’t feel right to me. I feel almost like alienated or you’re tryna purposely alienate me by making me win rap awards, or either just pacify me by handing me something, putting me in that category, cos it’s the only place you can figure out where to put me. And remember they don’t decide the winners, but they do decide the nominations so they have to play it politically. And shout out to Chance, for last night, like I said I’m speaking from a winners point of view and I’m so happy for him, I’m not talking about.. I’m not angry about how last night worked out. But when you ask me like where, like do I feel, like racism, or do I feel it the same as everyone else, yeah I feel it, I notice it going on in it’s own places. But thankfully I get to be around the greatest group of people, my friends are from all over the place, they like Lebenese, they’re.. I’m Jewish, most of my friends are from the Islands of Jamaica, English, so I mean, we just don’t really notice it like that until I start talking about the music business\nYeah it’s a really tough time in the world and again that statement has been said over and over again and I think we know it’s a tough time and I’m …\nHow did it feel to be on stage in Manchester when the Grammy’s were going on, you stuck to the tour..\nYeah I mean I did it because that at the end of the day is what matters to me that’s real life you know. I was pitched by the Grammy’s to cancel those two shows and fly and go sit in the audience to lose because they don’t air the other rap awards on TV. So I would have left 30,000 people hanging to sit there and just be there for their own ratings you know. The worst part is I expressed myself, like man I’m really thankful I was at those shows in Manchester cos those were two of the strongest shows that we’ve had so far. I texted somebody from the Grammys and was like I’m really glad I stayed behind, I really don’t wanna have this conversation about coming out there again and I got a text back that said ‘Blame It On Donald Trump’ – and I’m not gonna say who it is that I’m texting but this is like the institution, we’ve been conditioned to think that this it the true award for our accomplishments, for our music. By the way if you had a night like Chance last night, he deserves it, for his friends, for his family, for his collaborators, its amazing when they champion you. But all I’m saying is, to kids that will be coming up in the future and might now get championed or might not get that moment, that’s OK too. Because you have to realise what institution you’re dealing with. You’re dealing with a bunch of people that are just people at the end of the day and they’re either good people to the core or bad people to the core and we’ll never know. But I mean yeah, I was really glad that I was in Manchester last night, and like I said I’m speaking from the perspective of a winner, I won two awards, it’s just it really put it all in perspective for that thank God that I stayed here and did what I’m supposed to be doing for the people that actually care about my music, you know. Yeah man, that’s just kinda how I feel about that about this given timeEmbed", "Hotline Bling Lyrics\nYou used to call me on my cell phone\nLate night when you need my love\nCall me on my cell phone\nLate night when you need my love\nAnd I know when that hotline bling\nThat can only mean one thing\nI know when that hotline bling\nThat can only mean one thing\nEver since I left the city, you\nGot a reputation for yourself now\nEverybody knows and I feel left out\nGirl, you got me down, you got me stressed out\nCause ever since I left the city, you\nStarted wearing less and goin out more\nGlasses of champagne out on the dance floor\nHangin with some girls Ive never seen before\nShe told me dont worry about it\nShe told me dont worry no more\nCause I cant feel my face when Im with you\nBut I love it, but I love it\nWhat do you mean?

We are rolling and were recording, lets begin. This is a very special broadcast of OVO Sound Radio right here, Beats 1, Apple Music. Long time coming man. Long time coming man...long time coming, an exciting time, an exciting night for obvious reasons. Any way, man, here we are in the Safe House this is kind of...I suppose the official home of OVO Sound, this is the heart now of OVO Sound, here in Toronto, OVO house based in Toronto. Uhm...Its 40s spot, where the music gets made.\n40s...uh what do they call it, like a brain child, brain child? This is 40s creation from the ground up...I mean I was here, man, when there were no walls. I was here when there was no...not even a hint of a studio, or any...and uhm, he saw it through to the end. I mean, incredible execution on a vision that he had from the very...very early on. I know hes always...hes always enjoyed living in the same space that he works in. So hes been able to build this...build this complex that we utilize to get the job done, yeah.\nWhen you walked in here for this first time, because I always thinking like....rooms you can catch a vibe pretty quick Yeah And you know 40 obviously build this, you were there for the process...and when, you know, he called you in for the first session...did you, did you catch a vibe? Did you record something that first night?\nI was here, uhm, I was here a few times as you know...I was here when this room first started functioning and everything else wasnt built. I think....I think maybe the first...one of the first things we did here that got released was probably Back to Back ironically enough, but I think that was kinda when we were kind of....Thats how you, uh, thats how you broke the bottle on the bow? Haha that was like one of the first... On that track? That was like one of the first thingsWow. that we actually recorded and it...and it...Tangible energy from the get-go.\nI mean, you know, just... Get it done. execution, man, just following suit. I watched 40 execute so I had to come in here and execute too, thats it. How many visitors really...I mean I know theres a lot of people in here tonight for obvious reasons, because, you know, were tryna capture something. You know...but, uhm, you know, when its, when its... business time, how many...how many visitors generally roll through here? Cause the vibe I get is you guys keep it pretty...pretty light.\nYeah, I dont really. Im not really into, like, a whole bunch of people and distraction, uhm...I have, you know, I have respect for everybody and their craft in whatever they do. So I expect the same thing when people come in here, I dont want a bunch of hustle and bustle, talking and...loud you know. And...and the other thing thats tough when you invite people in the studio...is theyre obviously coming to watch something happen. Right.\nAnd...and it doesnt always happen every night. You know...its not like every night is some magic moment. I mean, theres nights of frustration, theres nights of nothingness, theres night of just...you know, uh...these little tactical, uh, things. That clinical, surgical edits and stuff that...it gets you know Housekeeping. Right. I pretty much gauge the, uhm... characters that are allowed to sit in here based off of how they conduct themselves on those type of nights. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nAnd I think I have a pretty immediate, immediate team that is able to sit in here and I...I...I...I dont want to notice you, and thats not to be offensive, I just dont want to know that youre here. I want to be able to...to get up and just go in there and spill you know. Not worry about peoples feelings Yeah. or tensions or any of that, that makes perfect sense, you know. Today unless...you change your mind Laughing the albums done Its done. 40 sent it while the game was on. Its crazy, I mean were literally watching the Raptors while 40 was...you know... Mhm. I think the line was from Noel was right now weve been finished for seven seconds. Yeah hahahahaha.\nVincent like came in, he was like but nah, I sent the...I sent the email seven minutes ago, weve been finished for seven minutes. And he want to his computer and he was like ah, I never sent it. The game clock was kinda measuring the album clock too you know, its synonymous tonight. Oh man the world clock has been measuring the album now...and, and to a certain extent thats your fault. Cause back on August the 6th in 2014 you announced the name of the record. Yeah.\nNow...now I have...I spoke to your friend Skepta about announcing records prematurely. Mhm. And he was pretty straight about it, he wish he hadnt done it. He felt the pressure of announcing Konichiwa way up front, added additional pressure to him. I mean...you did it almost two years before you delivered the record. How did it work for you making that announcement, you know... in 2014?\nI think the...the announcement was more than just the album title, it was just a shift in the city. You know, that we, uh...we saw an opening there. You know, it was, it was, the name took on a life of its own. Uhm...and now the city is obviously referred to as, as what it is...Yeah. Uhm...and yeah, I mean...I...were...me and Oliver are always, are very cautious about that. Uh...we never wanna prematurely announce anything, but I kinda feel like, like its crazy that you say two years cause t really doesnt feel like two years. I mean, yeah, I just had this plan to finish this album and then...but I, I remember I was like oh man, well you know, Im gonna do a mixtape.\nJust cause Im just like at this place, where Im..Im in this hotel every night, I just wanna make rap music, and I always, always wanted to make a, a project with Boi-1da. Uh...just like, exclusively like his... his brand of music, like just hard ish, like uh...trying to snap as much as I could and get as many joints as I could in, in a short amount of time. Uhm...and so thats kind of, you know, I was really adamant about finishing that mixtape first and then I said, okay then Ill move on. I mean, when we...when we do these albums, and especially if its me and 40...its never not been me and 40...but, when me and 40 lock in. We really lock in ...yeah. and we take it very seriously and its not... its not like some rush job, you know? We...we, well sit there and, and we...like I said some nights we dont even come here and make music some nights we just talk yeah... we talk and we listen and you know, we try and figure out, what...what the direction is and what...what works for me... It seems to me, that might be a distinction because you blur the lines so successfully, it helps in the evolution of mixtapes. Theyve been around in existence for a long time and yet when you started to do and some of your peers started to do it at a similar time, these mixtapes were becoming blockbusters in their own right. They werent just moving the streets anymore, they were actually moving the sales and the charts and you were touring off the back of these things.\nWell, well that was it, I went...I wnt on a full-blown tour off of If Youre Reading This Its Too Late.... Its crazy. ...and it went straight to iTunes and I feel like thats like a...thats a hundred percent a possibility, same thing we do with a lot of the OVO Sound artists, you know, its like, why not? You put all this time and theyre all original sounds, why should shouldnt it be able to be...you know, I understand, I understand...the...the joy of getting a free body of work from somebody, but you know, this is like one of the only platforms we have left to like generate interest and income and all these, you know, these...get the attention and make it that easy to access... and focus... as opposed to going to ten different places to try and find it once links are being you know...so I mean... Its focusing your audience, isnt it ultimately? Yeah and thats really what its about right now, is, is...and thats, I mean not to shamelessly plug but even...you know, what weve been doing with Apple Music and stuff like that...its like you know, just focusing the audience and giving them a place to go and hone in on this one hub to go get everything.\nUhm...but with that being said, you know, I...I finished that tape and I was really happy with it a lot of the songs got bigger than expected and we had to go do some shows... I wondered that...I wondered, you know, if it...I mean I know you dropped it in the early hours in the morning and it was just like Wake up surprise, heres a Drake record and everything else, but i know how I felt about that album and millions of other people do as well and that record has become, in many respects, a modern-day classic...and I wondered if that caught you off guard?\nUhm...yeah I definitely...I definitely always just treated it like a mixtape. I...I was never...you know, even the difference between this album and that is like...the...the time we spent on the transitions, the layering of the production, the...the changes...just, just...sonically even, the time that 40 and Gadget put in...uhm, you know...this was just a tape that we did in my hotel room at the end of the day...Laughing so, I mean, its...its great that people love it, I mean, I always just looked at it as a bridge to get to where were...were at today.

The tour, slated to start after the Canadian rappers OVO Fest, will kick off August 8th in Darien Center, New York and run through September 27th, when it ends in Woodlands, Texas. That tour, which is sponsored by a video-game manufacturer, will feature a nightly competition between fans of the two rappers.\nThe meaning of the album title is unclear, but the announcement is just one part of what will be a busy summer for the rapper. On July 16th, Drake will host ESPNs ESPY Awards at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, where the ceremony will be televised live at 9 p.m. EST on the sports channel. The show intends to celebrate the best moments in sports with music, comedy bits and appearances by famous athletes.\nLater in the month, Drakes label OVO Sound will release two records by artists he signed. Majid Jordan will put out A Place Like This on July 22nd, and PARTYNEXTDOOR will release PARTYNEXTDOOR TWO on the 29th. Drake recently made a guest appearance on the latter artists Recognize, streaming below via Rap-Up, which will appear on the album.\nDrake will then stage OVO Fest in Toronto on August 3rd and 4th, when Outkast will perform and he will do his own set, with appearances by yet-to-be-confirmed special guests. This year, OVO Fest was awarded a CAN $300,000 government grant, which amounts to roughly US $268,000, as part of an initiative to help out festivals in Ontario. A press release claims the festival has sold out of the fests 35,000 tickets.5Embed", "Blue Tint Lyrics\nLook who Im fuckin again\nI had her on ice, but then\nI watched the ice get thin\nNow, does she sink or swim?\nShe had an attitude in the summer\nBut she bein nice again\nDouble my price again\nTop of the charts, back in their hearts\nHoney, he strikes again, whoa\nSome honeys bitter with life and they hate me\nThey wanna put knife in my ribs, whoa\nWay this set up, I live like Ronaldo\nBut I never been in Madrid, whoa\nShe said that that she workin, I told her come over\nAnd we can get right at the crib, whoa\nShe finish at six, but then say she got court in the morning\nTo fight for her kid, I told her Id pray for the kid\nWhat a time this is\nTo be alive for this shit\nPresident doin us in\nMy window got blue in the tint\nDid this shit once and Id do it again\nLook who Im fuckin again\nI had her on ice, but then\nI watched the ice get thin\nNow, does she sink or swim?\nBlue faces, I got blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah\nBlue faces, I got blue diamonds, blue tint, yeah\nLook who Im stuck with again\nI had her on ice, but then\nI watched the ice get so thin\nNow, does she sink or does she swim, now?\nShe bein nice again\nDouble my price again\nTop of the charts, back in their hearts\nHoney, he strikes again, whoa\nSome honeys bitter with life and they hate me\nThey wanna put knife in my ribs, whoa\nNobody better, the show up and runnin\nAnd I could put that on the twins, whoa\nWe not together, but I get the info on you\nCause Im nice to your friends\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, whoa\nShouldnt have told me, but they did\nWhat a time this is\nTo be alive for this shit\nPresident doin us in\nMy window got blue in the tint\nDid this shit once and Id do it againEmbed", "Soundcloud LyricsRemix of Yes Indeed by Lil Baby & DrakeEmbed", "The Freaky Friday Management Technique LyricsWe walk the same path, but got on different shoes\nLive in the same building, but we got different views\n—Drake, Right Above It\nMany years ago, I encountered a particularly tricky management situation. Two excellent organizations in the company, Customer Support and Sales Engineering, went to war with each other. The Sales Engineers escalated a series of blistering complaints arguing that the Customer Support team did not respond with urgency, refused to fix issues in the product, and generally inhibited sales and customer satisfaction. Meanwhile, the Customer Support group claimed that the sales engineers submitted bugs without qualification, did not listen to valid suggested fixes, and were alarmists who assigned every issue the top priority. Beyond the actual complaints, the teams genuinely did not like each other. To make matters worse, these groups had to work together constantly in order for the company to function. Both teams boasted superb personnel and outstanding managers, so there was nobody to fire or demote. I could not figure out what to do\nDuring this time, I miraculously happened to watch the motion picture classic Freaky Friday starring the underrated Barbara Harris and the incomparable Jodie Foster—note: there is also a high quality remake starring Jamie Lee Curtis and the troubled, but talented Lindsey Lohan. In the film, mother and daughter grow completely frustrated with each other’s lack of understanding and wish that they could switch places and they do:\nThrough the course of the movie, by being inside each other’s bodies, both characters develop an excellent understanding of the challenges that the other faces. As a result, the two women become great friends when they switch back. After watching both the original and the remake, I knew that I had found the answer: I would employ a Freaky Friday management technique\nThe very next day I informed the head of Sales Engineering and the head of Customer Support that they would be switching jobs. I explained that, like Jodie Foster and Barbara Harris, they would keep their minds, but get new bodies. Permanently. Their initial reactions were not unlike the remake:\nHowever, after just one week walking in the other’s moccasins, both executives quickly diagnosed the core issues causing the conflict. They then swiftly acted to implement a simple set of processes that cleared up the combat and got the teams working harmoniously. From that day to the day we sold the company, the sales engineering and support organizations worked better together than any other major groups in the company—all thanks to Freaky Friday, perhaps the most insightful management training film ever made2Embed", "Plenty LyricsLyrics from Snippet\nWhen I get it plenty\nPlenty, plenty, plenty, plenty\nShenseea Im gon get you like eventu\nTrust me, I’m

It was 1986 and I was barely aware of a place called Silicon Valley. In those days there was no “startup culture or entrepreneurship movement”. Most people were only recently becoming aware that computers existed and almost nobody knew where they came from. The startups themselves were quite different than today’s breed. Most of the important startups were computer companies like Sun Microsystems, Apollo Computer, Cyrdome, Compaq and Silicon Graphics. In 1986, there was no outsourced manufacturing and China was largely irrelevant to the technology industry. All the companies in those days had their own manufacturing—often in Silicon Valley—and were very large in terms of employees compared to today. Having more than 100 employees prior to shipping a product was not unusual.\nAlthough there were important exceptions, very few 20-year-olds started companies in those days. I was not the exception—I just wanted a job. I wanted a job, but I knew absolutely nobody in technology or in Silicon Valley and there were no technology startups in New York. I had no idea how to get a job and then I got a break.\nMy father’s friend had just married Ed McCracken, the CEO of Silicon Graphics. I had my father ask her if she would talk to Ed, which she did. Ed then passed me to his head of Administration, Ken Coleman. Eureka! I had made the proverbial “friend of a friend of friend” connection.\nKen agreed to meet with the son-of-a-friend-of-the-CEO’s-wife. After we met, he also agreed to take a chance on me as a summer intern.\nSilicon Graphics was the Google of its day—the place where all the best engineers wanted to work. The company invented modern computer graphics and was building the coolest machines in the world. Prior to arriving, the only jobs that I’d held were paperboy, busboy, waiter, bellhop and valet attendant. Coming from those environments, I thought that I had died and gone to heaven. One day I’m washing dishes and the next day I’m helping debug the operating system that would run the graphics for Jurassic Park. In one connection, I’d gone from the outhouse to the penthouse. Everybody at Silicon Graphics seemed to be a genius, the products were incredible and I never wanted to leave work. I knew that I had to do whatever it took to get myself to Silicon Valley permanently.\nUnfortunately, I had not been properly socialized for life inside a big corporation. As the son of a new left radical , I was combat trained. If somebody said something that I didn’t agree with, I wouldn’t hesitate to attack them ruthlessly, call their ideas stupid or personally insult them. I couldn’t help it. It was how I was raised. It was like I was Huey P. Newton and everybody else was The Man. I am quite sure that I would have and should have been fired several times, but for some reason Ken Coleman took an interest in me and smoothed things over whenever I got myself into trouble. He was my personal guardian angel. He helped me to build my life and career doing what I loved.\nOver the years, despite being about 100 times more important than me, Ken always found time to meet with me and give me pointers about how to be effective. Much of what you read on this blog originally came from Ken.\nAfter we met, Ken’s career continued to accelerate. He eventually became the chief operating officer of Silicon Graphics. He is now chairman of Saama Technologies and on the board of City National Bank, United Online and Accelrys. And Ken continues to help people like me. He helps people figure out how to fit into the amazing, innovative, magical world known as Silicon Valley.\nThis fits in very well with how we think about Andreessen Horowitz. We help technical founders learn how to be CEOs, we help engineers find the right company and we help executives find the right match. So, it’s natural, obvious and awesome that today we announce that Ken Coleman is joining Andreessen Horowitz as a Special Advisor.Embed", "Fit of the Weekend 1/11/14 Lyrics17Embed", "Still Got It

commitment back then\nBut now Ill let you tie me down, something like a tennis shoe\nAnd now I got bread I could grow, we can go do some things that we dont normally get to do\nSo got a thing for me,

how much your friends and crew mean to you and the sense of responsibility you feel to put on for your city. Can you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like LeBron to make that decision, and that ultimate responsibility?\nDrake:\nYeah, I mean, I think that for the last week and a half I’ve probably been bothering LeBron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be. I think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life he’s in. I don’t think that there’s a better way to deal with it than how he just did. I think if we can give out an award at the ESPYS for incredible essay writing, I would definitely love to present that to him because I think what he just did was patriotic in its own way, was courageous and was just, to me, I think it’s going to be one of the most historic things of our generation.\nI’m just honored to know him and glad that I’ve gotten to, no pun intended, witness this moment for sure. I think it’s an incredible thing. I actually woke up kind of late today, so I’m just catching on. It’s a great feeling for me. I can’t wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud I am because he’s been a friend of mine for a long time.\nShell:\nObviously, you’ve joined Saturday Night Live and we’ve had Justin Timberlake host the show. Are you going to take a more musical approach to the ESPYS than what we’ve seen in the past?\nDrake:\nI think obviously one of the talents that I’m able to bring to the ESPYS is music, but I’m just going to get up there and I want to just prepare a great night for people. I think we have prepared an incredible night for people. I definitely want to incorporate music, but I’m not there to put on a strictly music‑based show. Yeah, we definitely have some incredible pre‑tapes. Yeah, I think it’s just going to be a great night overall. I’m there to deliver a great hosting job.\nShell:\nWhat makes the perfect ESPYS host? We’ve seen some amazing people like Justin Timberlake and John Hamm and even LeBron James. What strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer?\nDrake:\nWell, I think what makes a perfect ESPYS host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats. But I think most importantly what I bring is the fact that I feel that I know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys I have personal relationships with. I think I’m going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that I don’t know.\nTo me, it’s just about knowing the room that you’re in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve.\nShell:\nHosting a sports awards show, what do you feel is music’s role in sports?\nDrake:\nWell I said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go. I think that when I speak to any of my friends that play sports they’re always super into music, whether it be rap or other genres. My dream in life or my other dream in life that I’ll obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league, so I think they’re synonymous in that way. We inspire each other, and I think that’s what really ties music and sports together.\nShell:\nThis is a question for the producer, and if possible I have a follow‑up for Drake. With the LeBron news and the decision that was so successful for ESPN, was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the ESPYS? Did anybody reach out? Were you close?\nMaura Mandt:\nNo, there was not an attempt to have that be there. And with the decision, it wasn’t something we were looking to have that announcement be on the ESPYS. Certainly if LeBron wanted to announce on the ESPYS, I would have happily had him there. I think what the ESPYS is about is the sports world plays out over the year, and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective, and that’s what you look for the host for.\nWe’re going to be reflecting on the year, and LeBron is something that happened, so it will definitely be something that we’ll address in the show. But just like in sports, we don’t try to make that news happen. It unfolds.\nShell:\nDrake, in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance, and a lot of times in hip‑hop that’s kind of also a part of rap music and it’s always been. Do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage, whether it be metaphorically or outright in hip‑hop?\nDrake:\nI think that’s a funny question. I think it’s a good fit. I definitely think that hip‑hop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for. I think we’re not trying to end people’s careers or make people feel bad in any way, and that’s kind of most of the time what problems in hip‑hop are about. So our night, like I said, is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports.\nSo, yeah, I think there is definitely a difference. Though being clever with words is being clever with words, so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has. But I think the end goals are a bit different.\nShell:\nYou’re also being aware of public perception. For instance, you Instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer, right, and you so like you definitely have, I don’t know how to put it, maybe a love triangle thing going on with Skylar and she’ll probably be there. Can we expect a joke or where you’ll mention it like you did with SNL when you did the whole dated Rihanna thing? Everyone loved it, so can we expect that now that you’ll be hosting the ESPYS?\nDrake:\nWell, I obviously don’t want to give away the material. But I do have a growing affection for Skylar, and I’m not sure she’ll be able to make it, but I’m sure I’ll give you a treat if you enjoy my past references. I’m sure, if I haven’t done it already, now that I know you’re looking for it, I might stick one in there, for sure. You never know.\nShell:\nOne of the things about ESPN and the ESPYS is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the build‑up. Today, I don’t know if you realize this, but you’ve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that Chris Brown posted up. I just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means?\nDrake:\nWell, as far as the latter end of the question, I’d rather not comment on it, but I know that our goal is obviously the night of the ESPYS to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards. I think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet. That’s why I’m excited.\nWe’ve been working hard, like I said, on the pre‑tapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night, which I can 100% guarantee it will.\nShell:\nIs Cleveland your new favorite sports city? How are you going to incorporate A. Wiggins, Manziel, and LB James into your ESPY segment?\nDrake:\nFirst of all, I’d like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks, I do not team jump. I’ve been ‑‑ in the past, I’ve always supported the player and not the institution unless it’s the Kentucky Wildcats or the Toronto Raptors. Those are two teams that I will never stray from. But what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer, whether it comes to football or obviously basketball, I have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams.\nSo it’s not that I’m team jumping, I’m just a supportive friend. With the recent news, of course I’m going to go ‑‑ of course I’m going to go watch games in Cleveland. If not for LeBron, who like I said has been a brother to me for years, I mean, we’ve got three kids from Toronto on one team, plus we have Manziel who, again, is part of our family and like a brother.\nSo I definitely have to look into some real estate in Cleveland and maybe make some trips this year. I might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best.\nBut, yeah, like I said, my teams will always forever be who they are, but, yes, I will support the group that has shifted to Cleveland. I think that for Cleveland, a place that I’ve been time and time again touring, I just think it’s going to be greet. I really would love to see that city grow because they’re just a supportive group of people, and it is a great place, so I’m really excited.\nShell:\nSo the ESPYS is your second host gig this year. SNL was amazing by the way. So is hosting something that you’re trying to do more of or are you just working on more music? You have a lot to write about now that you’re a bachelor again.\nDrake:\nWell, actually, my status hasn’t changed, just to clear that up. I’ve always been out here coasting. But aside from that, the ESPYS is my main focus like SNL. When I commit to something, I don’t let my focus stray.\nSo for Maura to give me this opportunity to host, I don’t take it lightly. I put everything on hold to be ‑‑ to give the best performance that I possibly can at this awards show, and then from there, I have things coming up, whether it’s the OVO Fest or the tour with Lil Wayne, which is a real thing, which a lot of people don’t know if it’s a real thing or not, but it’s very real and it’s going to be very competitive. And then from there, I’ll figure out the next steps for me.\nI’m always working on new music, but the ESPYS is the main focus right now, and we’ll figure out what’s next afterwards.\nShell:\nOne thing we learned about you after hosting SNL is you’re a tremendous impressionist. I personally loved the Katt Williams and Lil Wayne. With having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience, can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show?\nDrake:\nYeah, I’m actually excited to say that I definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance, and that is something that I actually pride in that I studied for. I love finding a character and getting into that character, especially if I know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms. So, yes, I will be doing impressions during the ESPYS, and they’re good. I’m excited. They’re great.\nShell:\nAre you bringing your lint roller?\nDrake:\nOh, yes. I think I’ll probably have it somewhere around. Maybe I should. I should bring it out on stage. You shouldn’t have said it on the call. You should have anonymously sent that tip in, maybe we would have used the joke. No, I think I’ll be lint‑free that night. I’ll have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit.\nShell:\nSo we know that you wore some custom Calvin Klein outfits for your tour. Are you planning on the same fashion wearing any Calvin Klein suits, and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what they’re going to wear?\nDrake:\nI’m not exactly sure what brands I’m going to be wearing. Right now I’m sort of still, like I said, very focused on the show. I’ll figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers I’ll be wearing. But I’m more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that I’ll be draped in for you all to admire. So that’s really what my main focus is, but I’ll get my suits together.\nI’m also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself. I might just cut to somebody and I won’t have to say anything.\nShell:\nYou have so many relationships with a lot of athletes. Is there anyone in particular that you haven’t met yet that you’re looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that you’re with already given you any advice about hosting?\nDrake:\nWell, I mean, I’ve gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends. You know, one of my mentors who is not an athlete, but obviously Jamie Foxx, a previous host and a big reason why I asked to be a part of this, just because that performance that he gave, I believe he hosted twice or three times, oh, twice, right. It was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music, but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was. So his mentorship and advice has been great to me. Is there anybody that I’m looking forward to meeting?\nI mean, yeah, I was going to say, I’ve never met Skylar. I’m sure it will be extremely awkward when I do. But I guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up, which she probably won’t. Her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something. But, yeah, if I ever get to meet her I probably owe her an apology right off the bat. It’s been all in good spirits. But, yeah, that is the one person I’d like to meet.\nJust for that last person, I also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music. I want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down. Yeah, Nick whatever his name is, because he didn’t win, so that’s how he’s going to be remembered. Nick whatever his name is.\nShell:\nCan you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you, and how many are coming from the writing staff? Also, if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song?\nDrake:\nOh, very good double question. Well, for the first part, the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible. We have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady Maura all the way down to the writers and everybody that’s involved. Everyone involved has been incredible to work with. We’ve been at it now for three months, I think, just on and off, meeting and talking and brain storming. As far as ideas being mine, I am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that I submitted are what I’m going to be performing or delivering on Wednesday night. Whether it be music, jokes and pre‑taped pieces, I was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it.\nIs writing a joke harder than writing a song? I think that because of the way I write songs which is very honest, raw emotion about my life, I think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because it’s just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding Drake song as the public would deem it.\nBut, yeah, I mean, all my music is so honest, that sometimes it’s hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself. When you’re able to be lighthearted and joke around, I enjoy it. It comes a little quicker than songs do.\nMandt:\nI’d like to make a comment on the collaboration process. Having worked on the show a number of years, one of the things that really resonates in the content is when it’s authentic from the person delivering it. Being able to have the access we’ve had to Drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on what’s coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life, it really elevates it, so it’s definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved.\nWe had a shoot the other day from one of the skits, and on set he was coming up with stuff, and you guys will see it and know what I’m talking about when you see the show. But there was no script in certain areas of it. It was really like an improv session, and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see. I’m really excited to have that be seen by everyone on the show.1Embed", "One Night Stand Lyrics\nShorty got a man\nShorty got a man\nShorty got a man\nShe said she got a man\nShe said she got a man\nIts a one night stand\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nShorty got a man\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nIts a one night stand\nA one night stand\n \nDiamonds hang around my neck the crib is all finish\nNo love for these bitch, This year is all business\nIt is a shame that a couple of them are off limits\nNo offense to my nigga, Its just the industry small\nWe all lust for the same women\nYou know the ones we saw before we came in it\nI know we aint trippin\nI know I got a couple things that Lil Wayne dip in\nThat Lil Wayne dip in\nI be the same wit it\nThis shit is all about hits and misss\nThe ones that you fucking\nAnd the ones you wife up\nDont letem fuck your life up\nHalf a mill to perform\nWhen its lit up\nWhen its lit up\nShorty got a man\nShorty got a man\nShorty got a man\nShe said she got a man\nShe said she got a man\nIts a one night stand\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nShorty got a man\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nIts a one night stand\nA one night stand\n \nYeah, I met her on facebook\nThats right Thats right\nI met her on facebook\nSaid it started when I started liking pictures\nMaking comments\nAnd all over And all over she told me\nWe threw\nYeah I know\nShe would act funny too\nThe next thing I know she came through the crew\nYeah we spread real good\nAll night on the floor, on the couch, on the table\nYou know how we do\nThen the next thing I know\nShorty got real low\nCause her man at home\nHe textin lets go\nI told her she made it\nNah Nah I threw\nShorty got a man\nShorty got a man\nShorty got a man\nShe said she got a man\nShe said she got a man\nIts a one night stand\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nShorty got a man\nShe said she just wanna fuck\nIts a one night stand\nA one night standEmbed", "One Man Show Lyrics\nLook, I aint never had a benzo\nNope, I pushed me an Ac wit the tintzo\nNosey niggas is peakin in my window\nHave a hard time looking\nI tell you second hand thats a hard grind cooking\nCause my pop was in it so deep\nIf his son wanted in it these dealers would probably drop percentage\nInstead, I drop bars like Im two months sober\nIts my time now so them you months over\nYeah if I want it I find me a way to get that\nIm trying to get to the point where I can sit back\nTook a lot of patience and action\nI grind so Im anticipating relaxing\nIm thinking bout replacing the Jacksons on top of the charts\nI dont need brothers fillin space in the back than\nSo from the kid with the sun tan flow\nThe hottest ticket in town to this one man show\nI think that you know as well as I know\nPeople checkin for me every where that I go\nWhat you gotta understand that its me I be\nUntil the motherfucking day that I D.I.E\nI think that you know as well as I know\nPeople checkin for me every where that I go\nWhat you gotta understand that its me I be\nUntil the motherfucking day that I D.I.E\nI can easily makeem admit to bounce back\nWithout knowing exactly where my accounts at\nYeah you best believe that I often tend to surpass what the rest achieve\nSo they dont like me and throw parties and yet they never invite me\nI cant lie sometime it bother me slightly\nEither way the true fans yell\nI appear calm and its obvious so who can tell\nAnd no this aint Blu Cantrell\nThis is like perfection though we both got the light complexion\nCouple things that I do that well\nAnd the way that I Jack-son you think that Drake new Sam-L \nIve been real though \nThey stay kicking it with me like a field goal\nSee Im humble but I live vain\nWith more deals on the table than a bridge game\nI think that you know as well as I know\nPeople checkin for me every where that I go\nWhat you gotta understand that its me I be\nUntil the motherfucking day that I D.I.E\nI think that you know as well as I know\nPeople checkin for me every where that I go\nWhat you gotta understand that its me I be\nUntil the motherfucking day that I D.I.EEmbed", "Hotline Bling LyricsDrake -

That should be my day of no luck\nIt’s the thirteenth/ weren’t we here just a second ago?\nOh, a year maybe? That’s my reckoning so\nRecollecting on how we disconnected\nI fell through the cracks/ came back nauseated\nAnd hating the fact my insecurities kept pulling me down for real\nSo sick/ couldn’t go/ feeling to throw up\nI was torn up/ thoughts tormented and so fucked\nGoing insane ‘cause I chose one\nCouldn’t fathom ever having to let her go\nAnd you know what? I’d be lying in my bed\nStare up the ceiling ‘til the minute that she’d walk by\nAnd step inside/ say ‘hi’/ chill a bit\nThen at best give a hug or a goodbye and yet\nI would pray she stayed like the days that we lost\nMaking our way to the way that we was\nBut my major mistake – I remained unlocked\nPut my all on display but then failure popped\nWave after wave but I still gave a fuck\nWish I was making this up but I’m not\nThere were days I would wake up and then doze straight off\n‘Cause I couldn’t deal with it\nMind, body, soul set ablaze/ make it stop!\nI would say to myself/ hate how I felt\nThis girl got me so dishevelled to the point\nThat the Devil himself couldn’t take it\nAnd put in a request that I’d be sent straight out of Hell\nI’m not one to place the blame for any of this major pain\nThat I was put through/ wishing you would say name\nBecause I felt hurt/ trapped in this cell worth less\nAnd I ain’t even got to the L word yet\nSay my name say my name\nIf no one is around you\nSay ‘baby, I love you’\nIf you ain’t running game\nSay my name say my name\nYou acting kinda shady\nBaby why the sudden change?\nSay my name say my name\nSay my name, ooh\nSay my name say my name\nIf no one is around you\nSee I felt hurt\nBut I never gave up/ I was mad/ too attached\nI was dumb/ I was blind/ I was axing the facts\nIgnoring every instinct/ collapse ‘em and act\nLike everything was okay/ I was being me\nThen I started seeing cracks/ soon enough\nThere was no way I could ever feel like I’d match up\nTo these man you would hang with so I backed up\nStruggling in silence/ muffling my voice\nNo more muscle to get violent\nStepped up a gear still I felt like my rebuttal had no mileage\nTired out/ drained and trapped in this madness/ unh\nAt times I could swear I was an actor\nTryna be like these guys/ oh my…\nThink back like “KD, why would you do that shit?!”\nSelling out just to tell ‘em how you were there\nTake notice but still you would let her down\nYou dived in headfirst/ got hurt and that’s it\nBetter man up and stand up and act in a manner\nThat won’t go expose just how deeply enamoured\nYou are with this girl and then damage your status\nShatter your chances/ your heart and your sanity\nMan I remember that happening back then how manic I felt\nWhat I had with this girl brought me back to anxiety \nWho the fuck was I tryna be?! \nCouldn’t help but think rightfully \nThat you’d never be mine fully \nSay my name say my name\nIf no one is around you\nSay ‘baby, I love you’\nIf you ain’t running game\nSay my name say my name\nYou acting kinda shady\nBaby why the sudden change?\nSay my name say my name\nSay my name, ooh\nSay my name say my name\nIf no one is around you\nSo a year back from today\nI was in my room with a few tracks I could play\nAs a soundtrack to my night\nWe had talked/ sorted shit/ got along\nNo scraps on the plate but we still weren’t acting the same\nSat back had this one track on replay\nThen I realised next day it was V Day\nFuck!

Its been six years since your best battle\nYoure barely enhancin\nYoure still tryin to top yourself: Marilyn Manson\nYou were the man in the freestyle era, you were livin the dream\nBut battle rap changed and you dont fit in the scene\nYou aint Lebron James, this is your king?\nYou more like Malone, Stockton, youll never win in the ring\nMr. Two Time Everything, the old champs back\nNow excuse him while he gives himself a Pat on the back\nCharrons tramp stamp\nIt took a while to react, they still dont get it\nHowd you birth a thousand battlers and still look pregnant?\nYo, that one bar you said about Mexicans was subpar\nCause yeah, yall do roll deep, but all of you are in one car\nThis was supposed to be your big moment homie, breathe it in a bit\nCause now they got you battlin me, reconsider it\nI got it sewn, no need to stick a needle into it\nHow fitting, Randy Savage in a ring at Queen Elizabeth\nMost people need two months for this shit, give me a week\nIll waste the first six days writin my victory speech\nYour chicky?

This is my theme park\nMy mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark\nPistol on my side, you dont wanna hear that thing talk\nLet the king talk, check the price and pay attention\nLil Wayne, thats

LyricsInstrumental: 6 God by Drake\nWhy they telling me I can’t do it?\nWhen they don’t know a fucking thing\nThey see happiness as something that the money brings\nAnd I’m the dummy here that’s fumbling\nI’m done with this/ me; I’m having none of it\nJumping out the thunder still I’m wondering\nThey hear my words but think of me as drunk I mean\nNothing I could conjure up would ever pick me up\nI need something made of substance or I’ll always be kept underneath\nAnd as much as I would love to be the one that cuts the leash\nAnd lets you open up your minds and wander free\nI just can’t/ used to think my father could\nBut if he failed then I don’t stand a fucking chance\nI’m hearing stories of these people past their forties\nActing borderline mature and boy this shit’s just getting boring\nSo I’m calling just to call out this moronic kinda BS\nAnd alleviate this stress/ I’m going all in ‘til I’ve poured it out\nI’m not new to this\nComing from the motherfucking 6 side\nI’m not new to this\nNiggas wouldn’t make it on this side\nI’m not new to this\nI’m not new\nI’m not new\nLord knows\nHe knows it better than you ever could\nI’m feeling so unsettled\nIf you knew me well you’d know for sure\nI never would attack you out of hate\nIn fact I feel I have to say I wrote this out of love\nI’m only stepping foot in these territories\nSimply ‘cause I’m sick of hearing everybody\nPeddling their beefs and their opinions\nEvery second always talking him and her\nAnd he did this and he got that and she got this and he knows her\nYou react in such a way that’s so confusing to me\n‘Cause I grew up with you in my head as someone to look up to\nNow I’m losing you/ believe me when I say I feel so stupid\nWho could look up to some people hooked on beef\nAnd just gossiping and frolicking in politics\nAnd all of it’s just knocking on my head\nThis shit’s a problem\nSo I’m shooting just to hook you in\nAnd help you out before I snap and have to look towards the hookah\nTemper rising ‘cause I’m trapped inside this pressure cooker\nSurrounded by these people I should break my neck to look up to\nBut every time I look up I don’t see a thing\nSo only place to look now is look down\nAnd look at all these overgrown children\nHold in my emotion with an overdose building\nSober up and hoping for a colder soul\nStill sit holding onto hope although I know it won’t kill this\nBullshit so I’m diving in this pool and going comatose\nIll shit/ my anger’s got this pen in my hand\nPenning this banger as penance for any disrespect\nI may have sent your way\nLet me reassess my manners\nBut this ain’t no apology\nI just feel uncomfortable\nI’m airing out my family but still I feel I need to do it\nJust to get this off my chest\nI’m mad but see I love you still\nI fucking will until my end\nI’ll punch your grill from time to time\nIn the hope I let you know just how I fucking feel\nThrow dirt on my state of mind/ no doubt it’s messy\nGive a shout to Messi/ put me on this beat to beat it down\nAnd show how deadly I can get if you were to ever send a hint\nThat you’d go out your way to just go disrespect me\n‘Cause I can be as disrespectful as Fifty dissing Game and Buck\nOr Shady taking ladies and their babies\nAnd explaining how his chainsaw’s gonna wake ‘em up\nIt’s crazy how I use to be\nNow usually I straight up question anyone that says some shit\nThat’s news to me/ I’ve grown up/ still see the world as beautiful\nBut thing is now I just don’t act as beautifully\nAnd I feel like friend or fam I’ll end it now\nThis is who I grew into/ who gives a shit?\nYou knew me then/ try know me now\nI hold my sound in ‘til I spit\nThen I’m back to laying low\nI’ll show you how\nYou get close\nYou sit back\nDon’t get close\nThen next step

grapevine\nBut jealousy is just love and hate at the same time\nYeah, its been that way from the beginning\nI just been playing, I aint even notice I was winning\nAnd this is the only sound you should fear\nMan, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right\nOh, I know, I know you dont love me, baby\nThey’re trying to take you away from me\nOnly over my dead body\nYou say Im old news, well who the new star?\nCause if Im going anywhere, its probably too far\nJust performed at a Bar Mitzvah over in the States\nUsed half of the money to beat my brothers case\nRed wine over Fed
