This is the track-by-track of our new album, Thats The Spirit. Doomed was the first track that we wrote for the album, and it was also the last track we finished. It was intended to be the first song on the album, because it made it clear that this record isnt gonna be like what youve heard before, because we explored ideas out of our comfort zone and it was this really weird instrumental track, which I loved and I had no idea what to do with it. And no matter what I wrote for the chorus, it just didnt sound right, and we were so close to scrapping the track completely. We recorded it in a silent arena. But in the final push to complete it, when , I cracked it, and in a way this absolute nightmare that contributed to the subject matter of song. Its about how most of my life feels like an unmanageable monster that I cant keep at bay. The first half of the track is my self-destructive, nihilistic side of me. The side that doesnt want to wake up, a side that consumed me until I went and got help. In the second half is this lyric, the devil told me no room for cheats, I thought I sold my soul, but he kept the receipt, and thats me basically getting a second chance, even though it seemed like I had a death wish. Rather than trying to fight these demons, I should embrace them. I guess its me realizing that I secretly enjoy this . I think I secretly find depression romantic, and sometimes I just like to let it take over me. Its almost like a euphoric sadness - it cleanses your mind if you just let it happen. And thats what its all about, this album.

It sounds like something you’d hear in a club. And it’s all about people who live for the weekend and people that’s my age, 30 something or older, they’re still trying to live like 18 or 21. They’re trying hard to have fun they don’t even realize that they’re probably not even having any. The song is meant to sound like you’re walking into a club and I wanted the irony of it to sound like something night out when lyrically it’s saying none of this way of life makes sense to me anymore. The end sax trumpet outro is another idea that came from me. I wanted this final part of the album to feel like when the lights come on at a club or a bar and you get that slightly shitty song feeling. It’s like all good things must come to an end. It’s the only song that’s called something different to the actual lyrics in the song. But if you listen to the chant, the crowd vocals are singing Oh no, a parody on your generic pop-dance song. They all have these cop-out ‘Woah’ sections and we vowed to never have that because we believe everything has to be in the song for a reason, it has to have weight and worth. But this is the one song where it makes sense to the part like that because it’s almost like taking the piss out of something to have that and lyrically it’s contributing to the whole theme of the song.", "Everybody jump\nMy secrets are burning a hole through my heart\nAnd my bones catch a fever\nWhen it cuts you up this deep\nIts hard to find a way to breathe\nYour eyes are swallowing me\nMirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing\nMy skins smothering me\nHelp me find a way to breathe\nTime stood still the way it did before\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nFell into another hole again\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nEdge of the world\nEdge of the world\nShould I sink or swim?\nYour eyes are swallowing me\nMirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing\nMy skins smothering me\nHelp me find a way to breathe\nTime stood still the way it did before\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nFell into another hole again\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nWake up!\nTake my hand and\nGive me a reason to start again\nWake up!\nPull me out and\nGive me a reason to start again\nTime stands still, time stands still\nTime stands still, time stands still\nTime stands still\nYour eyes are swallowing me\nMirrors start to whisper, shadows start to sing<\nMy skins smothering me\nHelp me find a way to breathe\nTime stood still the way it did before\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nFell into another hole again\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nIts like Im sleepwalking\nTime stood still the way it did before\nIts like Im sleepwalking", "Crawling in my skin\nThese wounds, they will not heal\nFear is how I fall\nConfusing what is real\nTheres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface\nConsuming, confusing\nThis lack of self-control I fear is never ending\nControlling, I can’t seem\nTo find myself again, my walls are closing in\nWithout a sense of confidence\nIm convinced that theres just too much pressure to take\nI’ve felt this way before, so insecure\nCrawling in my skin\nThese wounds, they will not heal\nFear is how I fall\nConfusing what is real\nDiscomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me\nDistracting, reacting\nAgainst my will, I stand beside my own reflection\nIts haunting how I cant seem\nTo find myself again, my walls are closing in\nWithout a sense of confidence\nIm convinced that theres just too much pressure to take\nIve felt this way before, so insecure\nCrawling in my skin\nThese wounds, they will not heal\nFear is how I fall\nConfusing what is real\nCrawling in my skin\nThese wounds they will not heal\nFear is how I fall\nConfusing what is real\nTheres something inside me that pulls beneath the surface\nConsuming, confusing what is real\nThis lack of self-control I fear is never ending\nControlling, confusing what is real", "Are you ready?\nHere we go!\nWhat doesnt kill you makes you wish you were dead\nGot a hole in my soul growin deeper and deeper\nAnd I cant take\nOne more moment of this silence, the loneliness is hauntin me\nAnd the weight of the worlds gettin harder to hold up\nIt comes in waves, I close my eyes\nHold my breath and let it bury me\nIm not okay and its not alright\nWont you drag the lake and bring me home again?\nWho will fix me now?
