Shuffling and other bodily movements can be heard in the background.\nRIDE: How long is it gonna take?\nScattered electronic music begins playing in the background.

I dont know what Im supposed to say.\nThe left video feed begins to pan in on a closeup of RIDE. His face remains darkened.\nRIDE: I dont know exactly when, how many times--\nRIDE : Black google.\nRIDEs own voice, dubbed over the video, cuts him off. At the same time, the left video feed cuts to a zoomed out view of RIDE, the light source behind his head now revealed in full.\nRIDE: Uhh...\nThe left video feed slowly zooms on RIDEs face. Cut to black. RIDE begins to scream out repeatedly. With each scream, an ambiguous image lights and then fades on the right side of the screen.\nRIDE : Yeah... Yeah.\nBetween each of RIDEs exclamations, raucous guitar and drums play briefly, then stop.\nRIDE : Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\nThe right side of the screen cuts to RIDE in a nondescript room. With both fists bared, he charges at a wall. Just before his fists connect, the screen cuts away to a front view of his face and torso. Between each exclamation, cut to short clips of RIDE screaming and smashing chairs.\nRIDE : Rah! Yeah! Rah! Yeah! Rah!\nAn ultra closeup of RIDEs face is pictured left. He remains expressionless. Pictured right, a short clip of RIDE sitting in a chair, moving his hands wildly, and laughing manically plays and then disappears. Pictured left, the camera zooms out slowly to reveal RIDEs full face.\nUNKNOWN MAN : How long did it take to get to this place? ...To this place.\nPictured right, cut to a darkly lit hallway with plastic hanging from the walls. RIDE stumbles frantically along the hallway. The right side of the screen then cuts to black.\nRIDE : Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black. Google black.

Both sides of the screen fade to black. A full screen closeup of RIDE appears, lit with pink light.
