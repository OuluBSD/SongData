We had never met or really spoken, so I was a little intimidated. When we started to do the song and Eminem made his entrance, I got goose bumps, the likes of which I have not felt since I first saw Jimi Hendrix, Mick Jagger, James Brown and Aretha Franklin. Eminem was that good. I just thought, Fuck, this man is amazing. There are very few performers who can grab you like that the first time — only the greats.\nEminem is a true poet of his time, someone well be talking about for decades to come. He tells stories in such a powerful and distinctive way. As a lyricist, hes one of the best ever. Eminem does for his audience what Dylan did for his: He writes how he feels. His anger, vulnerability and humor come out. Thats why we look forward to listening to Eminems lyrics and finding out where the hell hes headed next.\nEminem lives, sleeps and breathes music — hes a bit like me in that respect. Hes pretty much a recluse. I think hes enthralled with what hes doing; hes intimately involved with his art. Theres a mystique about him. From the start, I have always admired Eminems thinking. Thats the reason I wanted to appear on the Grammys with him when I was asked, despite all the nonsense talked about his being homophobic and crap like that. The Boy Georges of the world all got up in a twist about it. If they didnt have the intelligence to see his intelligence, that was their problem.\nEminem has the balls to say what he feels and to make offensive things funny. Thats very necessary today, when irony is becoming a lost art. Artists like Eminem who use their free speech to get a point across are vitally important. There just arent many people in the world with balls that big and talent that awesome.", "Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh\nI was justified when I was five\nRaising cane, I spit in your eye\nTimes are

Select them from the fundamental menu to complete the new Fireboy and Water girl experience\nComponents Temple is the most up to date game in the Fireboy and Water girl 5 establishment. In contrast to the past games in the arrangement, this game has a blend of 7 unique sanctuaries, each with 5 or 6 new levels. The sanctuaries in the game incorporate the 4 past sanctuaries in addition to 3 new sanctuaries: fire, water and wind. To approach the new sanctuaries, you should initially finish a couple of levels in the backwoods sanctuary\nThe game methodology proceeds with similar ideas as in the past games in the establishment. Fireboy and Watergirl should cooperate to finish each level. Fireboy should stay away from water pools and Watergirl should keep away from magma pools. Each level is a kind of puzzle where the members need to sort out the correct moves they should do to finish it. As you complete each level, gather however many jewels as you can to improve score. On the off chance that you discover a level to be too hard you can find support in the walkthrough video, later in this page\nThe Fire Temple levels are remarkable in light of the fact that they contain just magma pools that Fireboy can stroll around in and no water pools. Despite the fact that it appears to be a simple sanctuary for Fireboy it precisely the inverse. Fireboy should do all the difficult work to clear a path for Watergirl to have the option to arrive at its entryway. It is a joint exertion all things considered\nThe Water Temple is a similar idea as the Fire Temple just with water. All levels of the Water Temple have just water pools where Watergirl can stroll around openly. This doesnt mean a simple sanctuary for Watergirl. Watergirl should run in any event twice as much as Fireboy to track down a protected entry for her red pal\nVisit here : https://madboyhub.com/", "Its a long long journey\nWhen youre on your own\nIts
