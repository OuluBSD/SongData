in our well-being than we may realize. Experts believe that good flexibility helps you to achieve better results in your training, increases mobility and muscle coordination, reduces muscle pain, and prevents injuries. Good flexibility also improves blood circulation and it may play an important role in preventing some serious illnesses, like arthritis, diabetes, and kidney problems.\nWe at Bright Side prepared some exercises to help you increase your flexibility. Do them after your regular workout or a couple of times a week for 4 weeks and the results will amaze you sooner than you think.\n1. Cat-cow stretch\nA cat-cow stretch is great to start to warming up the spine, it also works on the flexibility of the back, neck, and shoulders.\nGet on your hands and knees.\nArch your back slowly, dropping your stomach to the floor and raising your head up.\nPause for a few seconds.\nSlowly round your back up like a cat.\nRepeat 10 times.\n2. Back extension stretch\nThe back extension stretch is fantastic for stretching your back, just make sure that you don’t overextend it. If you feel any pain or discomfort on your neck, you probably went a bit too far.\nLie down on your stomach.\nCome up on your elbows keeping your stomach down to the floor.\nThen push up on your hands, in a pseudo push-up position, but still keeping your hips on the ground.\nHold it for 30 seconds, repeat 3 times.READ MORE>>>>READ MORE\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nTAG:yoga,Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle,fitness,women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health,yoga,Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health,yoga,Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff,fitness,Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss,fitness,Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health,yoga,Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird,yoga,Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird,fitness,Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff,yoga,Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada, Weird, Public health, Health, Science, Cool Stuff, Weight Loss, Lifestyle, women, Womens Health, Health UK, Health Canada,", "A fuck nya thats that shit I don’t like\nA snitch nya thats that shit I dont like, nah\nA bitch nya that’s that shit I dont like, nah\nSneak dissers, thats that shit I dont like\nDont like, like, dont like, like\nA snitch nya ny-ny thats that shit I dont like, nah\nDon’t like, like, don’t like, like\nA bitch nya thats that shit I don’t like\nA fuck nya thats that shit I dont like\nA snitch nya thats that shit I don’t like, nah\nA bitch nya thats that shit I dont like, nah\nSneak dissers, thats that shit I dont like\nDont like, like, dont like, like\nA snitch nya ny-ny thats that shit I dont like, nah\nDont like, like, dont like, like\nA bitch nya thats that shit I dont like", "", "Fff beep\nKnow how Im rockin like cutoff stockings nigga\nKeep kush in my pocket\nAll designer get your grind up nigga\nNo Breitling no Rollie for the timer nigga\nGang Gang\nI been flexin since 08 \nI dont like the Hammer, Beamer or the SRT8, Mercedes \nMe and gang, pull up, we play hangman\nG-L-O aint none of that squad, is you crazy?
