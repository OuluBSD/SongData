But one day, deep beneath the waves, Noodle prized open a pearl shell of unearthly size, accidentally releasing an ancient hell demon. It scarpered, ready to party like its 1499.\nNoodle learned that this was Maazu, a shapeshifting devil of unimaginable evil, that could take human form. It had to be destroyed. To do so, she must remove its head from its body. Or the other way around.\nBut finding a shapeshifter is like looking for a beard at an Arcade Fire concert. For years, Noodle pursued Maazu across Japan, from the heights of Mt Fuji to the deepest, darkest forests. Finally, she tracked Maazu to Tokyo, where it had risen to the top of the criminal underworld.\nDisguising herself as a geisha, Noodle infiltrated its debauched headquarters, The Demons Lodge. And there, while Maazu was distracted by a heated bout of Drink While You Think, she lopped off its head. His earthly existence was over.

Unwittingly hed made himself prey to a far fiercer foe: a great white whale known as Massive Dick . The blubbery beast swallowed 2D in one bite, and swam into the deep.\nBut a lifetime spent eating ocean garbage – and now 2D – took its toll on Massive, and he died. His carcass washed up on a desert island, where 2D was finally free... to die of starvation, due to a total lack of survival skills. Unable even to catch crabs , 2D had no option but to eat his former host. Rancid whale blubber for breakfast, lunch and dinner. With a side of sand.\nSeveral months later, 2D spotted a plane flying along the coast. Moved to tears by this beacon of hope, he set off in its direction. Twenty-three minutes later he was in the middle of a full-scale beach rave. It turns 2D wasnt marooned at all. He had in fact landed on Guadalupe, off the Mexican coast. 2D joined the beach party, ate some strange-tasting brownies, and came third in the wet T-shirt contest.\nAs he claimed his prize, 2D had a eureka moment. He would have a gap year and find himself. It turned out finding himself was really easy – he was right there. But he stayed the rest of the year anyway, until he got sacked from his job weaving friendship bracelets. It was time to fly home.\nAt Heathrow, a man at arrivals held up a sign saying Wanker. 2D followed him to his car, which drove him to West London, where he was reunited with Murdoc, Russel and Noodle.

But the other shadow was a ship: the Battleship Ringo, owned by music industry giant EMI.\nBefore it was chopped up and sold like a prize pig, EMI had sent a fleet of ships to search the globe for Murdoc. At last, they had him. The Gorillaz star was captured, slapped about a bit, and taken to a secret prison on London.\nDungeon Abbey, beneath Abbey Road Studios, was built to detain the labels ABCs . For three years it served as Murdocs home, until one day, he was offered a deal by Entertainment Internal Affairs.

Noodle, riding on his back the whole way, guessed it was more likely the six tons of polluted shrimp hed swallowed en route.\nRussel had found Murdoc, but like a circumcision ceremony their reunion was cruelly cut short. Pirates attacked from all sides, so Russell cradled Noodle inside his giant mouth and swam away.\nTheir trouble, however, was just beginning. Somewhere off the coast of Japan, Russel was mistaken for a whale and harpooned. He managed to wriggle free, but in the fracas Noodle was swept away into the blood-red waters.\nWounded and delirious, Russel struggled on through the ocean, feebly humming the power ballad All By Myself until he lost consciousness. Eventually, he drifted into the warm waters of the Yellow Sea and washed up on a North Korean beach.\nGiant Russel was carted to Pyongyang, where he was exhibited like a modern day Gulliver. The regimes Glorious Leader declared that hed captured Pulgasari, the legendary North Korean Godzilla. Russel became the countrys biggest attraction, and I survived Pulgasari t-shirts became the nations fastest selling fashion item. Or would have done if people were allowed to sell anything other than manure and tanks.\nIn time, the Norths meagre food rations caused Russel to shrink back to normal size. Realising Russel was just a man, the Glorious Leader proclaimed that hed personally defeated Pulgasari, and Russel was released. He was given a signed pressing of Kim Sings Sinatra, and sent back to England, where he wandered the streets of London, until musician and Gorillaz collaborator Jeff Wootton let him crash on his futon.\nA few days later, Jeffs phone rang - it was Murdoc. Without delay, Russel moved into Murdocs new West London home.\nThe band was getting back together.", "When the passing looks to die for\nTake it in your heart now, lover\nWhen the case is out\nAnd
