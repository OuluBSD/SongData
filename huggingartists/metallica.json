Now its gone into business with BMG and is changing from a free service to a pay service. Is the threat over? Or will a similar site pop up?\nULRICH: There are all sorts of mini-Napsters out there. But Napster is successful because its Computer 101—with some of the other companies, the software becomes really complicated. And theyre not going to get out of the gate in the same way Napster did. Now everybody has their guard up. With every new technology some 19-year-old kid can come up with, somebody five minutes behind him can come up with a way of blocking it. Its never going to go away. But I think it can get to a point where it becomes sort of a nuisance, comparable to, say, bootlegging and piracy.\nPLAYBOY: What did you accomplish by going after Napster?\nULRICH: What weve accomplished most is to bring an awareness to the American public. It turned into the first big issue of the 21st century. People seemed to be more passionate about it than the presidential thing. Obviously, this has been the fucking wake-up call of the millennium to everybody who has anything to do with intellectual property. Theres this whole circle of older ladies who create sewing patterns. All of a sudden, these sewing patterns are being stolen and traded on the Internet. And these little old ladies arent getting their royalties.\nPLAYBOY: So now Metallica is allied with a bunch of old ladies.\nULRICH: Theres your sound bite.\nPLAYBOY: Some of your fans took Napsters side, instead of Metallicas.\nHETFIELD: Because theyre lazy bastards and they want everything for free. I think Napster won the press war. It hurt the fans perception of us—they see Metallica as some big bad guys who wanted to take their free stuff away. I like playing music because its a good living and I get satisfaction from it. But I cant feed my family with satisfaction.\nPLAYBOY: So Napster damaged Metallica?\nHETFIELD: I dont want it to read Napster has damaged Metallica. Its pretty difficult to hurt us. They did damage to how Metallica fans perceive us.\nULRICH: I dont agree. Weve taken hits from day one: between haircuts and using Motley Crue-Bon Jovi producer Bob Rock, to headlining Lollapalooza to writing ballads to making records with a symphony orchestra. Thats part of being an instigator and a forerunner.\nPLAYBOY: Aside from his natural garrulousness, why did Lars become the bands spokesman against Napster?\nHETFIELD: My wife and I were giving birth to a second child . And family is number one. So Lars had to run with the torch, and there were a few bad moves. You know, Lars can get really mouthy and be a snotty-nosed kid at times. I cringed at certain interviews: Oh dude, dont say that.\nULRICH: I said some things that were borderline silly. When Limp Bizkit embraced Napster and took $2 million to play this free tour—it is possible to play free shows without taking sponsorship money, because we do that—I said it was total bullshit. I know a lot of people hate Fred Durst, but I think hes really fucking talented. Me and Fred kissed and made up. When I open my mouth, most of the time something somewhat eloquent comes out, and once in a while I talk a bunch of fucking bullshit. Im aware of that.\nPLAYBOY: What sort of things did the fans say to your face?\nHETFIELD: Some fans said, Leave Napster alone, dude—if they were suicidal . But that was after Metallica rocks, dude. So you would turn your thanks into a fuck you. Ive gotten into plenty of arguments with fans who just wanted to discuss it. This poor girl in Atlanta, I made her cry. She felt money was evil. Why dont you go live in Canada or some socialist country?\nULRICH: If youd stop being a Metallica fan because I wont give you my music for free, then fuck you. I dont want you to be a Metallica fan.\nHAMMETT: Im still shocked at the reaction people have. I thought it was so obvious: People are taking our music when theyre not supposed to, and we want to stop them. Computers make it seem like youre not stealing, because all youre doing is pressing a button. The bottom line is, stealing is not right.\nPLAYBOY: You guys pissed off a lot of people. On the Metallica Usenet group, theres an ongoing thread called Kirk and Lars are gay.\nHAMMETT: That just shows a total lack of creative juices. Thats like calling someone fatso.\nPLAYBOY: Maybe you were right on the merits. But its hard for people to sympathize with the rich.\nULRICH: Yeah, it is. So it becomes about these greedy rock stars. But understand, 80 million records later, I dont know what the fuck to do with all the money I have. So now can we talk about what the real issue is? The real issue, for me, is choice. I want to choose what happens to my music. Its pretty clear that the future is selling your music online. But common sense will tell you that you cannot do that if the guy next door is giving it away for free.\nPLAYBOY: When you started the campaign against Napster, did you know it would drag on so long?\nULRICH: Didnt have the foggiest fucking idea, no. This whole Lars Ulrich-posterboy-for-intellectual-property isnt something I sought out.\nPLAYBOY: Were you surprised when you got booed onstage last September at the MTV Video Music Awards?\nULRICH: I was unaware of it while I was up there. I got offstage, and people were like, Wow, you handled the booing really well. I was like, What booing?\nPLAYBOY: Thats surprising, because you looked really uncomfortable.\nULRICH: I was kind of drunk. It was the worst awards show, hands down, that Ive ever been to. I left, I went out to dinner with some friends and had some cocktails.\nPLAYBOY: When Napster creator Shawn Fanning came out in a Metallica T-shirt, they cut to you in the audience, and you looked aghast.\nULRICH: You have to understand, the whole thing was planned. They asked me to present an award to Shawn Fanning. The day before the show, Napsters lawyers pulled him out of it. They thought I would do something rude or obnoxious to him. MTV asked, Do you have any problem with him walking out in a Metallica T-shirt? I was like, Go for it. I knew about all that—I was just pretending to be sleeping. I had my hand over my face, nodding off. It was sort of contrived.\nPLAYBOY: What would it take for you to drop your suit against Napster?\nULRICH: They have been inquisitive about trying to settle. The only thing we were after was getting our lawyers fees paid. And we believe they have the ability to block access to whatever band wants it blocked.\nHAMMETT: Criticism is something weve always dealt with, since day one. When Kill Em All came out, there was nothing like it. When the second album came out, we had slow songs, for Gods sake! Even our fans fucking criticize us. We have bulletproof vests on when it comes to criticism. To tell the truth, we feed off of it.\nHETFIELD: Metallica loves to be hated.\nHAMMETT: Love to be hated, absolutely. Even before we were in the band, we were outsiders—so that mentality sits really fine with us.\nPLAYBOY: Now that youre superstars—not only on MTV but also on VH1—its easy to forget how unpopular you were at first.\nHETFIELD: When Lars and I hooked up, we liked a kind of music that was not accepted, especially in Los Angeles. We were fast and heavy. Everything about LA was short, catchy songs: Motley Crue, Ratt, Van Halen. And you had to have the look. The only look we had was ugly.\nPLAYBOY: Hey, but you were not immune to dressing LA style.\nHETFIELD: We had our battles with spandex, thats for sure. You could show off your package. Wear spandex, dude. It gets you chicks! On the first tour through America, my spandex—I fucking hate saying, my spandex. Its a pretty evil phrase. They were wet from the night before, and I was drying them by the heater. A big hole melted right in the crotch. It was like, Theyre not real pants, are they? Theyre like pantyhose. I just opted to keep my jeans on, and that was the best thing that ever happened. Lars wore spandex up through the Black Album tour, though he might tell you different.\nULRICH: We were very much the outcasts in Los Angeles. The first year or so, it was pretty lonely.\nHETFIELD: We did some shows where if our girlfriends werent there, thered be no one in the audience besides the bartender. Then a few diehard fans would follow us around, and they became crew members. Maybe that guy wants to lug some gear around so I dont have to.\nPLAYBOY: Where did the medieval, Dungeons-and-Dragons theme on the early records come from?\nHETFIELD: Judas Priest was a band we all dug. Oh, he writes about that. OK, then. Thats what you do to be metal. Then it got into more, Lets write about what we do: Whiplash, Hit the Lights and Seek and Destroy, which was just about smashing shit up. We worked at day jobs. After that, wed throw parties, take the furniture out of the house and smash the joint. We smashed dressing rooms just because you were supposed to. Then youd get the bill and go, Whoa! I didnt know Pete Townshend paid for his lamp! Come back off the tour and you hadnt made any money. You bought furniture for a bunch of promoters.\nHAMMETT: We would drink day in and day out and hardly come up for air. People would be dropping like flies all around us, but we had the tolerance built up. Our reputation started to precede us. I cant remember the Kill Em All for One tour—we used to start drinking at three or four in the afternoon.\nHETFIELD: Smashing dressing rooms was all booze related. The worst was A Day on the Green. A buddy and I, completely ripped on Jägermeister, got it into our heads that the deli tray and the fruit had to go through a little vent. The vent is not big enough. Lets make a hole! The trailer was ruined. Bill Graham—R.I.P.—was the promoter. I was summoned to his office. Like, I have to go see the principal now. He said, This attitude you have, Ive had the same conversation with Sid Vicious and Keith Moon. It was like, Cool! Oh, wait— theyre dead. Not so cool. Maybe I should get my shit together. I realized at that point there was more to being in a band than pissing people off and smashing shit up.\nPLAYBOY: James, what did you think of Lars after that first jam session?\nHETFIELD: Lars had a pretty crappy drum kit, with one cymbal. It kept falling over, and wed have to stop, and hed pick the fucking thing up. He really was not a good drummer. To this day, he is not Drummer of the Year. We all know that. When we were done jamming, it was, What the fuck was that? We stiffed him on the bill for the studio, too . There were so many different things about him. His mannerisms, his looks, his accent, his attitude, his smell. He smelled—he smelled like Denmark, I guess. They have a different view on bathing. We use soap in America.\nULRICH: American kids, there was this sort of compulsive thing about four showers a day.\nPLAYBOY: Well, did you wash?\nULRICH: Often enough for me. OK?\nHETFIELD: We ate McDonalds—he ate herring. He was from a different world. His father was famous. He was very well off. A rich, only child. Spoiled—thats why hes got his mouth. He knows what he wants, he goes for it and hes gotten it his whole life.\nULRICH: Im an only child. I come from about as liberal an upbringing as you can imagine. I traveled all over the world with my father. So, yes, James Hetfield and I come from incredibly different backgrounds. And as we grow older, we probably become more different.\nHETFIELD: He introduced me to a lot of different music. I spent a lot of my time at his house, listening to stuff. I couldnt believe the size of his record collection—I could afford maybe one record a week, and he would come back from the store with 20. He bought Styx and REO Speedwagon, bands hed heard of in Denmark. I would go, What the fuck? Why did you buy Styx?\nULRICH: I have an obsessive personality. When I become interested in something, I have to learn everything about it, whether its Danish chairs from the great modern era between 1950 and 1956, or Jean-Michel Basquiat, or Oasis. When I was nine years old, it was all about Deep Purple. I would spend all my time sitting outside their hotel in Copenhagen, waiting for Ritchie Blackmore to come out so I could follow him down the street.\nPLAYBOY: Since you love Denmark so much, why were you in LA?\nULRICH: I finished school in Denmark and moved to America to pursue a tennis career. We ended up in Newport Beach, which is like the snottiest fucking area of LA apart from Beverly Hills. Theres all these kids in their fucking pink Lacoste shirts, and Im in my Iron Maiden T-shirts. I guess there was a hatred for all that, a bit of an alienation. James Hetfield was the king of alienation. So there was a bit of a brotherly thing that brought us together.\nPLAYBOY: How alienated was James when you met him?\nULRICH: Id never met anybody that shy. He was really withdrawn, almost afraid of social contact. He also had a bad acne problem.\nHETFIELD: There wasnt much to say, I guess. When I met Lars, my mother had just passed away. Everyone was the enemy back then. I wasnt the best at talking—that came just from growing up in the environment I was in, kind of alienated. I was tired of explaining my religious situation. Once the band formed, I thought, I dont have to talk anymore. Lars can say it all. Then no one really understood what the hell the songs were about .\nPLAYBOY: So, what was your religious situation?\nHETFIELD: I was raised as a Christian Scientist, which is a strange religion. The main rule is, God will fix everything. Your body is just a shell, you dont need doctors. It was alienating and hard to understand. I couldnt get a physical to play football. It was weird having to leave health class during school, and all the kids saying, Why do you have to leave? Are you some kind of freak? As a kid, you want to be part of the team. Theyre always whispering about you and thinking youre weird. That was very upsetting. My dad taught Sunday school—he was into it. It was pretty much forced upon me. We had these little testimonials, and there was a girl that had her arm broken. She stood up and said, I broke my arm but now, look, its all better. But it was just, like, mangled. Now that I think about it, it was pretty disturbing.\nPLAYBOY: Did you ever run away from home?\nHETFIELD: Once, me and my sister split. Our parents caught us about four blocks away. They spanked the shit out of us, pretty much.\nPLAYBOY: So do you believe in spanking your kids?\nHETFIELD: Spanking my friends, and their wives. Yeah, as a last resort. But with the spanking comes a huge explanation why.\nPLAYBOY: What was your parents relationship like?\nHETFIELD: It was my moms second marriage—I have two older half brothers. I didnt really see any turmoil. They didnt argue in front of the kids. Then Dad went on a business trip—for more than a few years, you know? I was beginning junior high. It was hidden, that he was gone. Finally, my mom said, Dad is not coming back. And that was pretty difficult. There were some bad times—my mom needed to be home when we kids were home, or Id have killed my sister. We beat the living hell out of each other. I remember burning her with hot oil, and that was, Wow, it went too far. My mom worried a lot, and that made her sick. She hid it from us. All of a sudden, shes in the hospital. Then all of a sudden, shes gone. Cancer got her. We went and lived with my stepbrother Dave, whos 10 years older. My sister was being unruly, and she got thrown out of the house. I finished high school, then, See ya, everybody.\nHAMMETT: James comes from a broken home, and I come from a broken home, and when I joined the band, we kind of bonded over that. I was abused as a child. My dad drank a lot. He beat the shit out of me and my mom quite a bit. I got ahold of a guitar, and from the time I was 15, I rarely left my room. I remember having to pull my dad off my mom when he attacked her one time, during my 16th birthday—he turned on me and started slapping me around. Then my dad just left one day. My mom was struggling to support me and my sister. Ive definitely channeled a lot of anger into the music. I was also abused by my neighbor when I was like nine or 10. The guy was a sick fuck. He had sex with my dog, Tippy. I can laugh about it now—hell, I was laughing about it then.\nPLAYBOY: It does seem that heavy metal attracts a disproportionate number of people whove been abused.\nHAMMETT: I think heavy metal is therapeutic—its music that blows the tension away. I think thats why people who have had really bad childhoods are attracted to heavy metal. It allows people to release aggression and tension in a nonviolent way. Also, heavy metal has a community feeling—it brings outsiders together. Heavy metal seems to attract all sorts of scruffy, lost animals, strays no one wants.\nULRICH: Ive always had issues with that, because I dont feel I had major psychological damage in my life. Why is that limited to metal? If you go to an Elton John concert, people have the same emotional baggage. If you lined 10 Metallica fans up against the wall, you would get 10 different stories.\nPLAYBOY: And three of them would piss on the wall.\nULRICH: And one of them would knock his head against the wall, yeah. Im not so comfortable embracing those types of clichés.\nPLAYBOY: At the beginning, did you consider any names other than Metallica?\nULRICH: We had a list of 20 possible names: Nixon, Helldriver, Blitzer. I was really keen on Thunderfuck.\nPLAYBOY: When did you start to draw female fans?\nHAMMETT: Girls were always at the shows. Its just that they didnt look much different from the guys.\nULRICH: Girls would come on the bus and just blow the whole bus. Like, OK, heres two girls, everybody get in line. People would say, Eww, she just blew that other guy. . . . So? You dont have to put your tongue down her throat.\nHETFIELD: They enjoyed what they did. And, heh-heh, they were good at it. Back then, we all shared stuff. I did her. Dude, here! Have my chick. Lars would charm them, talk his way into their pants. Kirk had a baby face that was appealing to the girls. And Cliff—he had a big dick. Word got around about that, I guess.\nULRICH: We used to have this thing called tough tarts—it was fucking great. Wed come offstage and thered be like 10 naked girls in the showers.\nHAMMETT: I couldnt figure out why all of a sudden I was handsome. Did I wake up looking different? A fat bank account will make you look handsome. No one had ever treated me like that before in my life.\nPLAYBOY: Who was the biggest slut in the band?\nULRICH: We all had some pretty slutty moments. I dont think theres anybody in this band who hasnt had crabs a couple of times, or the occasional drip-dick.\nPLAYBOY: What do you remember about the night Cliff Burton died?\nHETFIELD: I remember getting awakened with shit flying all over the place. I busted out the emergency window in my underwear, 20 degrees, and Cliff was missing. I remember seeing his legs sticking out from under the bus. He had the whitest, skinniest legs. I knew he was gone then. The bus was right on him. We were all in the hospital, and our tour manager said, Lets get the band together and go. When he said the word band—it wasnt the right word. Shit, were not a band anymore. We went to the bottle and started drinking.\nHAMMETT: Cliff was a very smart guy, a reader, very eloquent. I just dont understand why he went, and not one of us.\nNEWSTED: Cliff Burton was my god. He was the guru. I mean, no one before him and no one since him has played like that. People have copied him, but nobody ever had his feel or his prowess.\nPLAYBOY: So you were a big fan back in Arizona?\nNEWSTED: Metallica was the hugest influence for my band, Flotsam and Jetsam. We played mostly around Arizona, at clubs and for desert parties.\nPLAYBOY: What is a desert party?\nNEWSTED: You borrow from your parents, put together 80 or 120 bucks, and rent a generator for the day. Get some tables from the high school to make a stage, and you rent a fog machine. You get some dudes to buy a keg, and you say, Once people come, youre going to give us 40 bucks. You get the U-Haul stuck in the ditch, pull out some of the tables, put them under the tires and smash em up to get the truck out. The dudes that are buying the keg are already drinking. Its one oclock in the afternoon. Theyve got .44 magnums on their sides. In Arizona, if you have your gun showing, you can wear what you want. Drunk as fuck already, and you find out that they robbed a Safeway last night. Oh yeah, were going to get money out of these guys. Then set up and play for an hour or two and the Scottsdale cops come out and bust everything up and thats the end of it. I didnt make any money playing until I joined Metallica. The most I remember making—for what we thought was a huge gig—was $26 between five of us.\nPLAYBOY: Do you ever miss that?\nNEWSTED: I miss being grimy. I miss the hunger. I miss the excitement of taking off work early to set up the gear at the club. And seven people show up but you still play like there are 700. There was a Burger King right across from the main club we played—we took down a mountain of 29-cent burgers. Happy about it! Im going to get a Coke. No, man, thats two more burgers! Fuck that! Well steal beer from a back room, dude. Because otherwise itd be boiled potatoes with ketchup stolen from Burger King.\nPLAYBOY: Had you seen Metallica while Cliff was alive?\nNEWSTED: Yes. In Phoenix, with Wasp, before Master of Puppets came out. Front row. Right in front of Cliff Burton, worshiping. Drooling. Banging madly. Fourteen bucks for a shirt, which was all the money in the world at that time. We only went to see Metallica. As soon as Metallica was done, we walked out. They just crushed it, and we knew everything they did by heart.\nPLAYBOY: How did you hear hed died?\nNEWSTED: A friend woke me up at six in the morning. He said, Youve got to get the paper, dude. I remember tears hitting the paper and watching them soak into the print. We wore black armbands when we played our next gigs.\nPLAYBOY: After you heard Cliff was dead, how long before you started to think, Hmm, Metallica is going to need a new bass player?\nNEWSTED: I daydreamed that day. Just like, What if, what if, what if?\nPLAYBOY: They brought you to San Francisco for an audition. Were you nervous?\nNEWSTED: That whole week, I didnt sleep. I might have lain down a couple of times. For five days I stayed up and played as long as I could. Blisters on blisters broke. When I could feel the nerve inside as I played the string, I stopped for a little while. A couple of my friends got together some money to pay for a $140 plane ticket to go do my audition.\nPLAYBOY: Pretty cheap that they didnt pay your airfare. Were they tough on the people who were auditioning?\nNEWSTED: One guy comes in, hes got his bass signed by the guy from Quiet Riot or something. And James just goes, Next! Like that, before the guy even got to plug in. Guys were, like, crushed.\nPLAYBOY: Tell me about the first year with them.\nNEWSTED: Hazing. And a lot of emotional tests.\nHETFIELD: We were mourning through anger. Youre here instead of Cliff, so heres what you get. It was therapy for us.\nNEWSTED: One time, its four in the morning, theyre hammered and knocking on my hotel door when we were in New York. Get up, fucker! Its time to drink! Pussy! You know? Youre in Metallica now! You better open that fucking door! They kept pounding. Kaboom! The door frame shreds, and the door comes flying in. And they go, You should have answered the door, bitch! They grab the mattress and flip it over with me on it. They put the chairs, the desk, the TV stand—everything in the room—on top of the mattress. They threw my clothes, my cassette tapes, my shoes out the window. Shaving cream all over the mirrors, toothpaste everywhere. Just devastation. They go running out the door, Welcome to the band, dude!\nPLAYBOY: Did you know they were telling people you were gay?\nNEWSTED: No. I mean, dude, there was so much, thats like a minor detail.\nPLAYBOY: Why did they do that and why did you put up with it?\nNEWSTED: Because it was Metallica, it was my dream come true, man. I was definitely frustrated, fed up and kind of feeling unliked. They did it to see if I could handle it. If youre going to fill the shoes of Cliff Burton, you have to be resilient.\nPLAYBOY: OK, guys, who was the biggest drinker in Alcohollica?\nHAMMETT: James. He would drink half a bottle of Jägermeister by himself, as well as drinking vodka.\nULRICH: James Hetfield. If me and James started drinking at the same time, six hours of hard liquor later, I would be passed out. For quite a while, he was embracing alcohol at a different level from the rest of us.\nHETFIELD: I was. I had to have a bottle of vodka just to have fun. Im surprised Im still alive.\nNEWSTED: Thats a tough call. Fist for fist, I think Lars. He can take it to a different place, because hes Danish. They get conditioned real early.\nULRICH: I had much more of the binge mentality; Id go every night for three days, then I wouldnt touch a drop for the next four.\nNEWSTED: James is the only one that ever drank so much he couldnt show up for a rehearsal or for photos. He is the only one who ever actually poisoned himself.\nHAMMETT: Jasons not so much of a drinker as the rest of us are. He likes to smoke pot.\nPLAYBOY: People who like fast music usually like fast drugs. Did the band get into speed?\nHAMMETT: Speed is a bad word in our camp. But speed freaks love us.\nULRICH: James is the only one who never really engaged in any kind of drug abuse. Me, Jason, Kirk and Cliff were always experimenting with different things to a higher degree.\nHAMMETT: Cocaine has definitely been in our lives. You hang out with other musicians, and next thing you know, you have five guys crammed into a bathroom stall. I had a bad coke problem on the And Justice for All tour, but I pulled out of that, because it makes me depressed, basically. I tried smack once. I was so thankful that I hated it.\nULRICH: I tried acid once; I was shit-fucking scared. The only drug Ive ever really engaged in is cocaine. It gave me another couple of hours of drinking. A lot of people use it as a way to get closer to you, and you fall for that. I go through cycles where I say, OK, Im going to pull away for a while. And then I take six months away.\nPLAYBOY: Jason, as time went on, did the band stop hazing you?\nNEWSTED: They actually got tougher as time went on. The second and third years were the most brutal. Instead of fraternity pranks, there were things that cut deep and were based on disrespect.\nPLAYBOY: What did they do that was disrespectful?\nNEWSTED: Turning the bass down on And Justice for All. Not listening to my ideas, musically.\nPLAYBOY: Is Jason even on And Justice for All?\nHETFIELD: His picture is on it . Someone sent me a joke CD, with a sticker on the outside that says, And Justice for All—now with bass!\nULRICH: Its the only record of ours that Im not entirely comfortable with. It became about ability and almost athletics, rather than music.\nPLAYBOY: Bands are usually like families, and it sounds like this family fights a whole lot.\nHAMMETT: There are a lot of soap operas and petty dramas that come with being in this band. I find myself playing referee. Ive been the buffer between James and Lars, Ive been the buffer between Lars and Jason.\nHETFIELD: Lars name keeps getting brought up, doesnt it? Hes usually the instigator, with his mouth. He can be a real ass at times, and pull attitudes. I punched him onstage once—probably our third gig ever. We agreed we were going to play Let It Loose for our encore, and he went up there and started a different song, Killing Time, because it started with drums. I turned back: You motherfucker! I couldnt remember the lyrics, it was a complete failure.\nULRICH: I started the song I wanted to play. I dont remember why—maybe I felt it was a more suitable encore. And then he punched me.\nHETFIELD: I remember throwing him into his drum kit a couple of times, throwing some cymbals, cutting his head open.\nULRICH: Ive gotten into a couple of fights with Jason.\nHAMMETT: Ive never hit anyone in the band. I practice a lot of yoga now, and read a lot of Eastern philosophy. Im a huge believer in karma: no meat, no beef, no swine, no fowl.\nHETFIELD: Im definitely not the smartest guy in the band, so winning an intellectual argument is not going to happen. Resorting to violence used to work. And intimidation.\nHAMMETT: When James comes at you screaming, he can be intimidating.\nPLAYBOY: A lot of bad things have happened to Metallica. Does that mean the band has bad karma?\nHAMMETT: Quite possibly. Goddamn it, weve been through a lot of things. It has to be karma. I dont know if its the energy our songs release. People channel the energy of our music—90 percent of the time its good, but maybe 10 percent of the time its bad. Ive heard stories of skinheads listening to our music and fucking tattooing song titles on their arms with big swastikas underneath. Maybe its just personal karma. Maybe the reason James has had so many accidents is because of his own personal karma, and it affects the band.\nPLAYBOY: How would you describe the change that came after And Justice for All, starting with the Black Album?\nULRICH: The earlier records were about brute force, stuff like that. As James became more comfortable, elements of vulnerability and confusion came across, with less banging-on-the-chest type of stuff. Instead of Its fucked up and Im going to kill everything in my wake, it was more like, Its fucked up and Im really suffering from it.\nHETFIELD: On the Black Album, when I went to write lyrics, I didnt know what the fuck to write about. I was trying to write lyrics that the band could stand behind—but we are four completely different individuals. So the only way to go was in.\nPLAYBOY: Of all the stuff you wrote, James, what was the song you most hesitated over recording?\nHETFIELD: Nothing Else Matters. That was a huge turning point. It was sensitive.\nPLAYBOY: In theme, Nothing Else Matters is kind of like the Styx song Babe.\nHETFIELD: Fuck you. Fuck you very much . I didnt think the band would like it. But they were really supportive about it.\nHAMMETT: All I could think of at the time was, James wrote a fucking love song to his girlfriend? Thats just weird.\nNEWSTED: At first, it didnt sound very much like Metallica to me. I like the fast, heavy stuff. I dont think Metallica should do country. We came pretty close to it on Mama Said . I dont think that tasted very good to me.\nHAMMETT: James always wants to be perceived as this guy who is very confident and strong. And for him to write lyrics like that—showing a sensitive side—took a lot of balls. Lars, Jason and I were going through divorces. I was an emotional wreck. I was trying to take those feelings of guilt and failure and channel them into the music, to get something positive out of it. Jason and Lars were too, and I think that has a lot to do with why the Black Album sounds the way it does.\nPLAYBOY: Before, you had been one of the more popular heavy metal bands. But with the Black Album, you became mainstream.\nNEWSTED: Once we hit MTV, better-looking girls started coming to the shows. Just overnight.\nHAMMETT: It sounds like a cliché, but girls like melody, they like soft, pretty songs. And if thats what it took to bring them into our little trap, more power to it.\nPLAYBOY: Do you think——\nHETFIELD: No. I like to not think.\nPLAYBOY: Only a few albums have sold more than 10 million copies. Do you think the Black Album is the bands best record?\nHETFIELD: There are some songs on there I dont like. Through the Never was a little wacky. Dont Tread on Me, probably not one of my favorite songs musically. Holier Than Thou was one of the sillier songs, more the old style of writing.\nPLAYBOY: When Load came out next, you guys had short hair and were wearing makeup and trendy clothes. It was quite a change from the denim and mullets.\nHAMMETT: It was just a phase. It was the zeitgeist of the moment. Who knows? We might do something even more extreme in the future.\nPLAYBOY: Like Hetfield in a dress?\nHAMMETT: I think that would be extreme .\nHETFIELD: I let Lars and Kirk take over a little on the image front. I really dont like looking at it now. Our fans go, What happened to Metallica, the rebel, longhair, greasy-biker, fuck-you band? Now it was U2 or Stone Temple Pilots, or some band relying on an image. What the fuck did we need that for? That was just stupid. Jason and I were really not into it—Kirk and Lars were gung ho. You either laugh about it or you get wound up. Im doing both, actually.\nPLAYBOY: You guys were kind of handsome without the mullets.\nHETFIELD: Come on! Mullets rule. Dude, I wanted to have long hair and short hair at the same time.\nHAMMETT: I never had a mullet, OK?\nNEWSTED: Im not going to fess to the mullet for more than like three months in 1987.\nULRICH: It was probably only James who had a mullet.\nPLAYBOY: Well, it sure looks like a mullet youre wearing on the inner sleeve of Garage Inc., Lars. What if James grew back his mullet?\nHAMMETT: If he does, Im going to dye my hair pink. You can have a funny haircut? So can I!\nPLAYBOY: James, youre progun and proenvironment. Did you vote for Al Gore?\nHETFIELD: No. Im afraid of someone taking my guns away.\nPLAYBOY: Then did you vote for Bush?\nHETFIELD: No. You have to go into the city to vote. So Im not going to vote.\nPLAYBOY: You describe drinking and performing as therapeutic. Have you ever been in real therapy?\nHETFIELD: Around the time of Load, I felt I wanted to stop drinking. Maybe Im missing out on something. Everyone else seems so happy all the time. I want to get happy. Id plan my life around a hangover: The Misfits are playing in town Friday night, so Saturday is hangover day. I lost a lot of days in my life. Going to therapy for a year, I learned a lot about myself. Theres a lot of things that scar you when youre growing up, you dont know why. The song Bleeding Me is about that: I was trying to bleed out all the bad, get the evil out. While I was going through therapy, I discovered some ugly stuff in there. A dark spot.\nPLAYBOY: So did the biggest drinker in Alcohollica stop drinking?\nHETFIELD: I took more than a year off from drinking—and the skies didnt part. It was just life, but less fun. The evil didnt come out. I wasnt laughing, wasnt having a good time. I realized, drinking is a part of me. Now I know how far to go. You cant be hungover when you got kids, man. Dad, get the fuck off the couch! Well, they dont say that—yet.\nPLAYBOY: Did you ever go to AA?\nHETFIELD: I wouldnt say Im an alcoholic—but then, you know, alcoholics say theyre not alcoholics.\nPLAYBOY: By then, you were spending more time with your father. How did that go?\nHETFIELD: It started off really bad. Very mad at him for making the family the way it was. It was never a real father-son kind of thing again.\nHAMMETT: James used to be a raging, out of-control drunk, always fighting, always getting into trouble. Hes a lot more patient now. I think a lot of that had to do with the passing of his father . After that, he was just a lot more appreciative, thoughtful and compassionate.\nPLAYBOY: James strikes us as kind of an enlightened redneck.\nHAMMETT: Ill agree with that 100 percent. He lives a certain lifestyle thats easy to poke fun at: He lives out in the country, drinks a lot of beer, has a bunch of guns, goes hunting.\nHETFIELD: I eat vegetables, too, man. Theyre just too easy to kill. Carrots dont get a chance to run. I think animals are there for us. Were on top of the food chain.\nPLAYBOY: Maybe you should have a hunting trip with one of those bands that supports PETA, like the Indigo Girls.\nHETFIELD: Which one should I kill first? Oh, them hunting with me?\nPLAYBOY: Are you uncomfortable with the degree of homophobia in metal?\nULRICH: Totally. Ultimately, why do me and Kirk stick our tongues down each others throats once in a while in front of the camera? The metal world needs to be fucked with as much as possible. When the band started, everybody would sit around proving their heterosexuality by gay-bashing and stuff like that. Like, Oh, fucking faggot. Does that elevate you to some greater he-man status? I never understood that.\nPLAYBOY: Weve heard James use the word fag jokingly. Does that mean hes homophobic?\nHAMMETT: Um, probably. James hasnt had a lot of experience with gay people, and thats a large reason for being homophobic. He needs to be enlightened in that area.\nULRICH: I know hes homophobic. Let there be no question about that. I think homophobia is questioning your sexuality and not being comfortable with it.\nPLAYBOY: For the first time in years, there are a lot of metal bands on top of the charts. Most of them are pretty bad, arent they?\nHAMMETT: Theres a lot of fucking crap. A lot of regurgitated stuff, too. That Papa Roach song , the main riff is from a fucking Iron Maiden song called Hallowed Be Thy Name.\nHETFIELD: Limp Bizkit seems a little cartoony to me. I dont like some guy just yelling. Like Rage Against the Machine—it wasnt singing, it was just some guy kind of pissed off, telling you his opinion.\nHAMMETT: To me, Limp Bizkit sounds like a second-rate Korn. Korn has a much better vocalist who is somewhat intelligent. A lot of these bands get the right ingredients, the right formula, and—voilà—they have a metal band. A band like Godsmack is just a cross between Metallica and Alice in Chains, with a bit of Korn thrown in.\nHETFIELD: Queens of the Stone Age is unique. This band Rocket From the Crypt makes me feel good.\nPLAYBOY: Three of you are married, two of you have kids. What has changed?\nNEWSTED: Five years ago, the band took priority over all other things. Now, families come first. I understand that. A family is more important. Im the only one whos not married, and music still plays the biggest part in my life. I mean, Black Sabbath is my number one band of all time, but Metallica has done more for metal. Metallica is the biggest heavy metal band there has ever been. I want to keep that strong. But Metallica is only one part of my musical life, OK? Those guys will be happy taking six months away from the music. They have other things on their minds. If I even try to go six days without playing with somebody, I have anxiety-type things happen.\nPLAYBOY: It sounds like this sabbatical is frustrating to you.\nNEWSTED: Yes. James and Lars started this thing together. They came through all of the hardships. And they have serious, written-in-stone feelings about the band, about how it needs to be run. Thats very, very hard to swallow sometimes. I guess our understanding is that we dont want to be like other bands, where people go off and do side projects. I have made some incredibly wonderful music with other musicians. It would just floor people—it has floored people. But I just cant release it.\nPLAYBOY: James and Lars wont let you?\nNEWSTED: Its not Lars.\nHETFIELD: We just disagree about side projects. Fans have always viewed Metallica as something they can rely on: Were always there, always strong, and thats a band. Weve been the same guys since day one, essentially. The only way you can get out of this band is if you die. When you say Metallica, you know who that is: Lars, James, Kirk and—uh, whats that guy? Jason . When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica. So there is a little ugliness lately. And it shouldnt be discussed in the press.\nNEWSTED: James Hetfield is the heart and soul and pride of Metallica, the protector of the name. Im not out to disrespect him.\nPLAYBOY: But he could respect you by letting you release the album?\nNEWSTED: Were getting really close to some things we shouldnt be talking about. I would like him to see that this music is truly a part of me, like his child is a part of him.\nPLAYBOY: What did James say when you told him that you wanted to release the album?\nNEWSTED: I wont go there. We have to change the subject.\nHETFIELD: Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band? Thats the part I dont like. Its like cheating on your wife in a way. Were all married to Metallica. Married to each other.\nPLAYBOY: So what is Jason supposed to do during the hiatus?\nHETFIELD: I dont fucking know. Im not his travel agent.\nHAMMETT: I just hope we can survive this in one piece without tearing each others fucking throats out.\nPLAYBOY: Lars, do you think that Jason should be able to release his album?\nULRICH: I wouldnt be able to look him in the eye and go, You cant put that record out. Thats not who I am as a person. Thats pretty much all I have to say. I just cant get caught up in these meltdowns. Ive got some issues in my family life, with my wife, that are a little more weighty than, like, whatever James Hetfield and Jason Newsted are bickering over.\nPLAYBOY: What if Jason were to put it out anyway?\nHETFIELD: I dont know. It would disappoint me a lot.\nPLAYBOY: How is the record?\nHAMMETT: Its a great album.\nULRICH: Its a nice record, very bluesy, like a poppier version of Stevie Ray Vaughans stuff.\nHETFIELD: Its respectable.\nHAMMETT: Ive spoken with Jason for hours on end. Im upset for him. James demands loyalty and unity, and I respect that, but I dont think he realizes the sequence of events hes putting into play. Jason eats, sleeps and breathes music. I think its morally wrong to keep someone away from what keeps him happy. That album will always be available in some format—whether its on Napster or in stores, people are going to hear it.\nPLAYBOY: Wouldnt it be funny if Jason released his album on Napster?\nHAMMETT: It would be fucking ironic as shit.\nHETFIELD: I dont mind being looked at as the asshole in the band. Well, within the band. As long as the fans think Lars is the asshole, thats fine .\nNEWSTED: James is on quite a few records: In the South Park movie, when Kenny goes to hell, James is singing, and hes on just about every Corrosion of Conformity album. Thats a shot at him, but Im going to keep it. I cant play my shit, but he can go play with other people.\nHETFIELD: My name isnt on those records. And Im not out trying to sell them.\nPLAYBOY: You want loyalty and unity in the band, but if youre too much of a dictator, you can end up losing band members. Weve got three words for you: Guns n Roses.\nHETFIELD: Those are three ugly words . They were a prime example of egos out of hand. Were definitely not in a Guns n Roses situation. It would never get like that. Id kill us all before that happened.\nPLAYBOY: Its three against one here: Youre the only one against letting Jason release his record. Can this conflict be worked out?\nHETFIELD: Some of us are just going to have to bend a little.\nPLAYBOY: Or bend over.\nHETFIELD: My back hurts, so it wont be me.\nPLAYBOY: Do all these conflicts actually help the band?\nULRICH: Youve used the word conflict a lot in the last 15 minutes. Ultimately, we have a love and respect for each other that supersedes the bickering. The key thing is, were fucking still here. And were the only ones that are still here. For whatever conflicts you keep talking about, we still find a way to exist as a working unit, and pretty much at the drop of a dime go onstage and kick everybody elses ass.\nPLAYBOY: Is this just the usual tension within Metallica, or is it worse now?\nULRICH: Thats a great question. Its an interesting time to interview the four of us separately. Youre hearing people get things off their chest—almost using you as the middleman. Like, James and Jason wont call each other, so theyre having a conversation through you.\nPLAYBOY: You and James havent talked, either.\nULRICH: I havent spoken to him for a while, thats true.\nHETFIELD: He hasnt called me. Im sure hell say I havent called him.\nULRICH: Its a little bit of the rock star stubbornness. Like, Hes not calling me, so Im not going to call him. Fuck him.\nHETFIELD: We both need time away; me and that fucking guy have been together for 20 years, man. Its an extreme love-hate thing, you know?\nULRICH: Weve been in this scenario a hundred times before. On the road sometimes, we dont speak to each other for a week. Me and James Hetfield are the two most opposite people on this planet.\nPLAYBOY: Your wife, Skylar, used to date Matt Damon, and he made her the model for the female lead in Good Will Hunting. A few years ago, Matt described you as a fucking rock star whos got $80 million and his own jet—a bad rock star, too.\nULRICH: He said that before we met. And hes apologized about a hundred times. The first five times I saw him, he would spend 10 minutes apologizing profusely. He really is a sweetheart.\nPLAYBOY: And youre an art collector, which is an unusual hobby for a metal drummer. What schools do you collect?\nULRICH: Abstract expressionism, the Cobra movement, art brut. I own a lot of Basquiat, a lot of Dubuffet, a lot of de Kooning. I have the best collection of Asger Jorn on this planet. I have what is universally considered as one of the two greatest Basquiat paintings; I spent a year and a half chasing it down. Hanging out backstage with Kid Rock is an amazing turn-on, no less so than sitting and staring at my Dubuffet for an hour with a fucking gin and tonic.\nPLAYBOY: Tell us about the summer 1992 tour with Guns n Roses, when a pyrotechnic explosion set you on fire during a show in Montreal. How bad were the burns?\nHETFIELD: It was down to the bone. My hand looked like hamburger. No matter how much water you poured on it, the pain came back instantly. The most painful part was the physical therapy—they would scrape off the skin with a tongue depressor. It was brutal. I was on pills, too, and it still hurt like a motherfucker.\nPLAYBOY: Speaking of pain, do you ever get headaches?\nHETFIELD: Are you saying its too loud? Its got to be loud. Youre supposed to feel it all over.\nPLAYBOY: Metallica toured a lot less than usual last year.\nNEWSTED: We did maybe 30 or 40 shows, and thats probably the least we have ever done. Metallica usually does from 150 to 250 shows in a year.\nHAMMETT: I have no qualms about not doing yearlong tours anymore.\nULRICH: Ten years ago, we wanted to play as many gigs as possible and have as much debaucherous fun as possible. Now, playing 200 shows in North Dakota is not as stimulating as it used to be. Sometimes its great being onstage, and other times the shows themselves become totally mediocre and youre just sort of floating through them. The older we get, and the shorter we tour, the better we are.\nPLAYBOY: How much longer can the band go on, given how physical the music is?\nNEWSTED: Its limited. People wont ever see me weak, wont ever see me just standing there onstage. When the day comes that I cannot perform, I will bow out. Thats it.\nHETFIELD: A gray mullet would look all right.\nPLAYBOY: Are there any tricks to writing a Metallica song?\nNEWSTED: About 90 percent of Metallica songs are in E minor, because James vocal range is limited—although hes developed by leaps and bounds.\nPLAYBOY: Any chance Metallica will follow the rap-metal direction?\nNEWSTED: No. No rap in Metallica.\nULRICH: The chances of James Hetfield going in a rap direction are probably between zero and minus one.\nPLAYBOY: From your perspective as a Metallica fan, Jason, it must be interesting to see James continue to evolve since Nothing Else Matters.\nNEWSTED: Where there was darkness before, now theres a lot of light, since James children entered the picture. The darkness will always be there, because of the damage done, but theres a big bright spot now.\nHAMMETT: We cant sing about flowers and happy shiny days, you know?\nPLAYBOY: So, James, will the next batch of songs be happy?\nHETFIELD: Yeah, Ill start writing about my house and family and dog. Look, theres always got to be some turmoil to write, and now, within the band, there might be some pretty good fuel.\nPLAYBOY: On the next record, we can expect a song called——\nHETFIELD: Side Project . Theres always something thats going to piss you off. Something youd like to change. Something that confuses you. All I have to do is go to San Francisco for one day—I get pissed off enough for a week.\nPLAYBOY: Youre happily married, the father of two, youve been to therapy. You even wrote a love song. Can you still find the dark spot?\nHETFIELD: I know its there, and how it got there. I can visit it and leave again. Its a dark spot you cant wash off.", "Yeah yeah\nYeah yeah\nOh\nBad\nYeah\nCome clean, confess up\nTell all, spill gut\nOff the veil, stand revealed\nShow the cards\nBring it on\nBreak the

You know.\nThis is-- This is part of me\nthats trying to be unfamous, I guess.\nBut its also\ngo-against-the-rules attitude.\nYou know, is this a big pose?\nI mean, yes, this is a pose.\nI mean, am I driving down the street\nto not get noticed in this thing?\nI mean, rebellious is kind of\nwhat this says, I would say.\n- Have you got a plug-in here?\n- Wait.\nSo, what exactly are you doing?\nWell, youll just hold it\nabove the pickups.\nOh, okay. I got you.\nYeah!\nGive me fuel, give me fire\nGive me that which I desire\nI got some bad news.\nGonna have to--\nChange the lyrics?\nI like this thing, Bob.\n- What?\n- I like this thing.\nI used to kid myself that art was\nmy great escape away from music.\nAnd I think Ive become\nincreasingly aware\nthat my interest in art, music\nand Metallica\nis not separate from anything.\nYou know, where does he feel\nthat theres enough\nof that kind of gold thing?\nHow come there isnt\nanother strokes\nup in that black area up there,\nwhere its kind of bare?\nWhere are the starting points\nand the end points,\nif you know what I mean?\nWhens a song done?\nWhat the fuck does\nthat mean, anyway? Done.\nWhens a record done?\nYou know, where does a record start?\nWhere does it end?\nWhere does the process start?\nWhere does the process end?\nAll that type of stuff.\nDo you know what I mean?\n- Daddy!\n- Its really interesting.\nYes, sweetie.\nI dont feel anything great there.\nI dont think\nits that great of a riff either.\n- How do you hear the riff then?\n- I like that:\nAnd then:\nYeah.\nIn nine days, itll be\nmy two-year anniversary of surfing.\nIts taken the place of a lot\nof bad things in my life.\nSo I basically stopped doing\nthe drugs that I was doing\nand cut way back on my drinking.\nYou cant surf\nwhen youre hung-over.\nYou cant surf if youve been up\nall night. Well, at least I cant.\nTheres a sort of individualism,\nalso, about surfing that I like.\nI mean, when its your moment, man,\nthats your moment and yours alone.\nAnd no one can help you.\nFor all intents and purposes, we go\ninto this record completely equal.\nEverybody contributing\njust as much on the lyric front\nas James contributing\nwith drum parts and...\nAs soon as you started talking\nabout that, I just like...\nYeah. Yeah. You flash back now.\nWell...\nYou wanna hear it with vocals?\nGo sing it.\nYou guys had some rules\nabout that before.\nQuite frankly, I dont give a fuck.\nIm tired of arguing.\nYou couldnt talk about his lyrics,\ntherefore, he couldnt talk about\nyour drumming.\n- Right.\n- Do you know what I mean?\nAnd you and him did the solos,\nso you werent allowed to comment\non the solos.\nDo you know what I mean?\nThere was, like, rules.\nAre you telling me that\nthose boundaries are gone now?\nIn the past, what we did was\nstarted with a bunch of ideas existing\non tape from everybody.\nThen me and James would sit down\nand turn those ideas into songs.\nAnd then we would tell the rest\nof the band what to play\nand when to play\nand how to play it.\nThere was never any,\njust, other ways of doing it.\nYou know, its a whole new thing\nfor me.\nYou know, writing in front\nof everybody,\nbecause Ive always just gone\ninto my own head\nand wrote stuff down,\ninstead of taking things from outside\nand putting them down.\nWhat I was thinking is, is like--\nThese are the hands that--\nThis is the face that--\nSo its, like--\nBuilding a Frankenstein\nor something?\n- Yeah. Pretty much.\n- Building what?\n- This is the top of my head thats flat.\n- A Frankenstein.\nThese are my bolts...\nWere on the same\nstream of consciousness here.\nWere just all working\non the same creative wavelength.\nAnd its inspiring to me.\nNow I can further express myself\nwith these lyrics\nnow that, you know, James has\nopened that door for Lars and I.\n- This is clay, right?\n- Yeah.\n- Not clam.\n- Clay.\nThese hands finger the clam.\nThese are the eyes\nThat cant see through me\nThis is the tongue\nThat speaks on the inside\nMake sure you really, like,\nspit cant see me.\nThese are the eyes\nThat cant see me!\nThese are the eyes\nThat cant see me\nThese are the hands\nThat drop your trust\n- This is the--\n- Yeah.\nThis is the eye--\nYeah.\nThis is the eye\nThat cant see me\nThis is the hand\nThat drops your trust\nThese are the boots\nThat kick you around\nThis is the voice of silence no more\n- What is this about?\n- Well, I mean, I said Frankenstein.\nIts not that far off,\ntalking about pieces of things.\nSo, I mean, some kind of monster.\nSome kind of monster?\n- You know?\n- Some kind of monster.\n- It is-- It is good.\n- You know what I mean?\nI like that.\nSome kind of monster\nSome kind of monster\nThe monster lives\nWe come now to create\nour album of life.\nThroughout our individual\nand collective journeys,\nsometimes through pain and conflict,\nweve discovered the true meaning\nof family.\nAs we accomplish ultimate\ntogetherness,\nwe become healers of ourselves\nand the countless who embrace us\nand our message.\nWe have learned,\nand we understand.\nNow we must share.\n- So thats just--\n- A mission statement.\n- A what statement?\n- Mission statement.\n- Mission?\n- Yeah, mission.\n- Its like-- You know, it sets a goal,\n- Right.\nso you just can, like, just always be\nreminded of, you know--\nYou know, what the ultimate goal is.\nAll right.\nIts my world, you cant have it\nIts my world, you cant have it\nIts my world, you cant have it\nIts my world, my world\nYou cant have it\nSucker!\nExcellent.\nCome on, little man. Lets go.\nSkylar, do you want your purse?\n- Daddy.\n- Ill come. Ill come.\nCome, Daddy. Come, Daddy.\nI dont know how you guys feel, but\nits really awesome what were doing.\nThe four of us can just go\nin a fucking room\nand roll that kind of shit\nout of our sleeves.\nPull it out of thin air, man.\nIts so exciting, because\nthat has just never happened before.\nI couldnt get to sleep last night,\nbecause I was still wired from it all.\nHow do you feel? You dont\nseem really psyched about it.\nWhat the hell.\n- Hows it going? Good to see you.\n- Yeah, thank you.\n- How many bears did you kill?\n- Two.\nRussias fucked up.\nYou know, it was like,\nyou put a bottle of water here\non the table.\nThat was it,\na bottle of vodka sitting there.\n- Did you drink vodka?\n- Hell, yeah.\n- You did?\n- What else is there to drink?\nAs soon as you got there,\nit was like, Na zdoroviya!\nNa zdoroviya!\nThats a pretty big bear.\n- Is bear edible?\n- They were no good to eat.\nThat freaked me out when\nthey didnt take any meat.\nYou know, they have been hibernating\nfor three months,\nso they havent pissed or shit\nor nothing.\n- Oh, so theyre toxic?\n- Yeah.\nThird day, I killed my bear,\nand I was just in camp\nfor the rest of the time.\nI was like, Oh, my God.\n- Worked on lyrics?\n- Yeah. I actually did.\nThat was a lot of time, man.\nA lot of time.\nI worked on lyrics in Siberia.\nHow to drink vodka\nand work on lyrics.\nTemptation\nWreck my head\nTemptation\nMake you dead\nTemptation\nSucks my soul\nTemptation\nFill no hole\nTemptation\nFuck you up\nTemptation\nNo, no, no, no\nI cant say no\nCant say no\nNo\nNo\nNo, no, no\nCant say no\nOh, no\nI cant say no\nGo away\nLeave me be\nJust leave me be\nSo, what were the reactions you got\nfrom those close?\nI mean, how did the family react?\nIm just-- I dont know.\nSometimes Im a real ass about it\nand just come in and say,\nOh, by the way,\nIm going to Russia for two weeks\nright here.\nYou know, and, What? You know.\nYeah, Im getting better at that,\nyou know,\nbecause that was the most\nI missed my family ever.\n- You know?\n- Right.\nAnd it was, you know,\nCastors first birthday I missed.\n- Right.\n- And it was--\nOf course, we had a little vodka\nto Castor.\nDid a little shot for him\nand everything.\nBut I wouldve loved to have\nbeen able to get ahold of home.\nWhos here?\nThis is Daddy working.\n- This is where Dad works?\n- Yeah.\n- What does your dad do for work?\n- Drums.\n- He plays drums?\n- Yeah.\n- Let me play drums.\n- Is he good at it?\n- Daddy, wanna play drums?\n- I played drums a lot today already.\nIm okay. You play for a while.\n- Those guys,\n- Thats very good.\nyou know, their plate is filled\nwith many, many things.\nAnd music is just one of the things.\n- Say, Bye, James.\n- Bye, James.\nBye, buddy.\nI chose not to have children\nand do those kind of things.\nMy music, thats my children.\nYou know?\nDaddys gonna stay and work\nfor a little while.\nBut since I decided to do it\nwith music,\nthen thats what I have\nto fill my time with.\nEchobrain is one of the projects\nthat Ive been working on for years.\nAnd now its come to fruition.\nAnd then when it comes to the time\nwhere my main cat, James,\ntells me that basically\nhe couldnt be in a band with me\nif I did the--\nTook this other project to this level.\nAnd after years of working\ntogether and going on buses\nand, you know, the stories, man...\nThere was no way that this thing\nthat I was doing\ncould affect the monster of Metallica.\nI just dont see how it could.\nAnd so-- And saying things like that,\nI couldnt accept that kind of\nlimited acceptance.\nI also know that this relationship\nis not over.\nYou know, hell-- Itll come\naround again at some point.\nYou guys will make contact.\nAt that time the managers suggested\nthat we have a psychotherapist\ncome in,\na man that meets\nwith pro-ball teams,\nyou know, big-ego, big-dollar guys\nthat cant get along\nbut have to make\nsome kind of entity flow\nso everybody else and everybody\ncan make their money.\nAnd I actually said:\nI think that this is\nreally fucking lame\nand weak that we\ncannot get together. Us.\nLook, the biggest heavy band\nof all time.\nAnd the things weve been through,\nand decisions weve made\nabout squillions of dollars\nand squillions of people.\nAnd this, we cant get over this?\nWas it more than just\nthe Echobrain thing?\nBecause thats, like, you know,\nwhat has been discussed.\nHe felt like he wasnt free enough\nto do what he needed to do.\nSince he wasnt getting his creativity\nout enough in Metallica,\nhe needed to get it out\nsomewhere else.\nAnd I totally understand that now.\nAnd...\nOn my side of that was,\nI didnt want him to enjoy that\nmore than Metallica.\nI didnt want anyone\nto leave Metallica.\nI didnt want to feel\nthat we werent enough\nor something like that.\nAnd it was-- Through my--\nI guess the way I learned how\nto love things\nwas just to choke them to death.\nYou know?\nDont go anywhere. Dont leave.\nYou know?\nYou have to stay here.\nOkay.\nNeed a pen, none of this pencil shit.\nCheck it out, man,\nhe cant even fucking spell it right.\nMetllica.\nWeve only been together years.\nI feel guilty that Im not inspired\nall the time.\nYou know, especially\nwhen everyone else is.\nIts like, Okay.\nWe kind of get to the point\nwhere the song is looped twice\nin the Pro Tools,\nand I know Bobs gonna hit me up\nfor some kind of lyric ideas.\nOh, shit. I was, like,\ndreading the whole process.\nIts like, Why are you dreading it?\nWhy dont you just--?\nWell, youre dreading it\nbecause of what?\n- Lets get to the fear.\n- Well, because I didnt have anything.\n- And so if you didnt have anything--\n- Wasnt inspired enough\nto have something or letting down\nthe team or some vibe like that.\nOne, two, three, five.\nSay it, Im lonely, yeah\nMotherfucking in my head\nIts like Im almost,\nlike, racing against time.\nTheres, like, weird-ass fear of like:\nI gotta come up with something\nmyself really quick\nbefore somebody else comes up\nwith something for me.\nAnd then if I dont like it\nor dont percent embrace it,\nthen Im just being a selfish,\nyou know, insular asshole.\nIts a fear response.\nWhen were up against a fear,\nthats the time to move into it,\nforward.\nBecause theres going to be\nsome kind of genius there\nor some kind of breakthrough.\nMotherfucker, yeah\nMetallica. Metallica.\nKirk.\nKirk.\nKirk. Kirk!\n- Kirk.\n- Kirk!\n- Kirk.\n- Kirk!\n- Yes.\n- Kirk.\n- James is trying to talk to you.\n- Sorry, man.\nYeah, its a bit stock.\nCheck it out, guys.\nI dont know how you feel.\nIm in a shit mood.\nAnd Im not digging it right now.\nEven last night, I gotta tell you,\neverybody kind of looked--\nI hate to tell you, looked pretty burnt.\nI agree.\nAnd if we dont start earlier\nand end earlier, Im just--\nIm not gonna be in a good mood\nfor the rest of this shit, you know?\nThat was totally weird for me.\nYou hear that, Bob?\nWhy dont you try getting\na more solid beat.\n- Regular.\n- Oh, well, you can call it regular.\n- You called it regular.\n- No, Im trying not to call it regular,\nbecause I know it bugs you\nwhen I call it regular.\nSo a little more solid, then.\nFuck!\nMaybe we should talk\nabout next week.\n- Well, all next week is therapy.\n- Yeah.\nDo we have to do that?\nCan we sack Phil?\nI mean, we gotta find--\nWe gotta find a balance to not--\nYou know, the Phil stuffs important,\nand I hope we all feel that thats\nan investment in the music.\nIts an important part of the record.\nGet all holy again\nLet me just go put one together.\nGet all holy again\n- Its just real confusing sounding.\n- Its just jacking the vocals all up.\nI mean-- I mean,\nits clever and everything.\nBut, I mean, I dont see\nwhat it does to the--\nI think thats how you hear it, dude.\nThats fine.\nIm just trying to do something\ndifferent.\nI mean, Im-- Im used to having\nthe drummer do the beat part.\nYou know what I mean?\nHolding it together.\nWhat Im hearing is...\nChoose my words carefully here.\nIts pretty straightforward.\nAnd the guitar shit, its--\nYou know, its a little stock.\nSo I started trying to introduce\nsome kind of edge to it on the drums.\nThose things we throw out\nto each other are complete bullshit.\nYou know? It sounds too stock.\nIt sounds too normal to me.\nI mean--\nYou know what I mean?\nYoure saying this shit\nso you can get your point across\nabout doing a drum beat.\nI mean... You know,\nit doesnt hold any water.\n- To you.\n- It doesnt.\nI think its fucking stock. What--?\nWhich part of that is unclear to you?\nI think it sounds stock to my ears.\nI mean, do you want me\nto write it down? I think--\n- Oh, yeah, please write it down.\n- It feels stock, okay?\n- I cant hear you.\n- So l--\nNo, when you say-- Youre telling\nme what to play, right now.\nYoure telling me, You should\nplay with what Kirks doing.\n- And Im telling you its stock.\n- Dude, fine.\nYou know what, you guys, why dont\nwe just go in and hammer it out,\nall right, instead of hammering\non each other.\nWere in shit moods, and were not\ngonna get anything done here today.\n- All you wanna do is pick a fight.\n- I dont wanna pick a fight.\nThis is so silly.\nYoure just sitting there going:\nIm in a really pissy mood and--\nAnd I fucking told you\nstraight up that I was!\n- Right.\n- And what are you trying to do?\nIm not trying to do fucking shit.\nYoure just sitting here\nbeing a complete dick.\nYoure-- Youre really helping matters.\nYoure really good at that.\nI was straight up with you,\nand I told you, Im in a shit mood.\nAnd what have you been doing?\nFucking picking at me all night.\nCome on, guys.\nWeve got better things to do.\nYeah, I do. I do.\nMetallica front man, James Hetfield,\nhas entered a rehabilitation facility\nto undergo treatment for alcoholism\nand other undisclosed addictions.\nIn a statement posted\non Metallicas official website,\nthe band writes, James has entered\nan undisclosed facility,\nand he will continue to receive\ntreatment until further notice.\nUntil then we have postponed\nall current activities,\nincluding recording sessions\nfor our new album.\nMetallica, whose hard-partying ways\nearned them the nickname Alcoholica,\nhave been working on their follow-up\nto the double disc...\nI think its easy to see that,\nin those days,\nMetallica brought a kind of\nphysicality to rock n roll.\nLets say the Beatles,\nthe Rolling Stones,\nyou know, and all that inspired\nsome of the British rock music\nthat then developed after that.\nAnd lets say the metal music\nand Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath\nand all of that.\nAnd then, out of that again,\nthen, lets say,\nthen came Lars\nand all of that and being--\nSo I think that they have certainly\na place in all of that, I think.\nLars had a very good vision\nat the time\nof where he saw that particular--\nYou know, the metal music going,\nbecause he could see it\nwith European ears and eyes maybe.\nDont you feel that its great for you\nto have your fathers perspective on\nwho you are and what youre doing?\nI think thats incredible.\nYou talk about the lineage...\nWhich we did,\nwe talked a little bit\nabout your grandfather.\nIts very difficult to admit it,\nespecially with him standing next to me.\nIts easier to talk about it\nwhen hes not in my presence.\nBut...\nOf course it is.\nWhat would you--?\nWhat would you say in private?\n- To who?\n- To anybody, without him here.\nSay it.\nYou know, what would it be?\nWell, I mean, Ive already said it\nto you countless times.\nWell, have you said it to him?\nYou brought it up. I didnt bring it up.\nWhat is it you feel youve said\nthat youre not saying now?\nI think maybe in some ways\nsome of the--\nTo me thats--\nFear of status quo comes a little bit\nfrom this direction over here.\nI think that--\nI mean, theres nothing worse\nthan when I have to go to him\nand play the new record\nand know theres something\non there that sucks.\nAnd he can see right through that\nin two and a half seconds flat.\nComments on that one?\nI would say, you know, if you said:\nIf you were our adviser,\nwhat would you say?\nThen I would say, Delete that.\nI mean-- I mean,\nI dont know for you guys.\nFor me, it doesnt cut it.\nYou know?\n- But--\n- Interesting. I mean, its interesting.\nYou know, now-- I mean, other\nthan the people involved here,\nthe only other people whove heard\nany of this music is Cliff Burnstein.\nWhen Cliff Burnstein heard that, he\nthought that should open the record.\nYeah. I mean, that could well be.\nBut Im pretty sure that--\nThat I really-- That I really--\nI really dont think so.\nYou know?\nI really dont think so.\n- Right.\n- For me, that--\nThat doesnt sound right\nor something. You know?\nUnless Im a guy\nthats kind of shouting\nin some kind of echo chamber.\nSo I think one\nof our responsibilities here\nis to act like a band\nthats still continuing.\nWere going on.\nWere doing our exploring.\nWere exploring ourselves individually,\nwere exploring our relationships.\nAnd we really need to get together,\ntalk about this,\nact like the band exists,\nbecause it does exist.\nAnd if we dont do that,\nthen we are the coproducers\nof the process slipping off the planet.\nThis is a bit\nof a shit sandwich, though.\nWhat does it--?\nThe unravelling of a band?\nAnd then there were two?\nSo a good friend of mine\nphoned me.\nAnd he knew where James was.\n- Really?\n- Yeah.\nHe couldnt even imagine James\ndoing anything for six months.\nIm prepared for the worst.\nIm pretty confident that, you know,\nwe will come together\nwhen the time is right.\nBut knowing when\nthat time will come,\nor not knowing\nwhen that time will come,\nis very, very uncomfortable.\nI hope that at some point\nhe will come back\nand try and finish the making\nof this record.\nlf...\nIf he walked away from Metallica,\nIm not sure\nthat it would surprise me.\nSay your prayers, little one\nDont forget, my son\nTo include everyone\nIve always felt that James\nwas a softer, more caring,\ncompassionate person than he\nallowed himself to be to most people.\nI can remember\nfrom the Dave Mustaine days,\nI mean, when him and Dave Mustaine,\nthese guys, they started right away\nwith their big, you know,\nchests beating and their mannerisms,\nand the whole thing was very much\nabout this kind of, like, macho--\nIt was just, like--\nI couldnt deal with that stuff.\nAnd looking back on, I mean,\nwhat was that, years ago,\nI mean, I just felt so alienated,\nbecause it was just so far removed\nfrom the upbringing\nthat I come from.\nWell, heres to you, my friends.\nBut then, at the same time,\nIm starting to realizing now\nthat the sort of depressive things\nthat show up\nas a result of the alcohol\nand stuff like that,\nit was just very difficult for him\nto communicate from the heart.\n- You want some or not?\n- And not hide behind\na lot of these different fronts.\nWhether its alcohol, that gives\nhim a false sense of strength\nor the front man in Metallica\nor, you know, macho bullshit\nand all that stuff.\nAll right, now you guys are drunk,\nand Im drunk.\nNow this is the fun part, man.\nI want to help him.\nI want to be there for him.\nAnd I want to do the best I can\nto make him the best person\nthat he can be.\nSo I dont know how the fuck\nits gonna play out.\nIts really healthy for me to be here\nwithout any pressure\nor anything related to the band\nor anyone who would remind me\nof the band.\nAnd to recognize whats real.\nOur sessions with Phil really stirred up\na lot of things in James\nthat he thought that he needed\nto address.\nMentally, its really taken--\nTaken its toll on myself, you know,\nand Im very worried about him.\nAnd, you know, whenever\nyou check yourself into rehab,\nthey dont-- They dont focus on, you\nknow, the fact that youre an alcoholic.\nThey go much deeper, you know?\nI mean, they go way deep.\nThey crack you open\nand then spill you out\nand examine all the things\nthat are on the table.\nIve spoken to him a few times,\nand, you know,\nI know hes having a rough trip.\nNo matter how bad it gets, eventually\nthings seem to sort themselves out,\nsooner or later.\nWhether its good or bad,\nthey sort themselves out.\nI watched the people\naround the world say\nwhat a great guitar player Kirk is\nand what a piece of shit I am.\nAnd that I got kicked out of Metallica.\nAnd I wasnt good enough for them.\nAnd that I was a loser.\nAnd Ive had to deal with that\nfor almost years.\nIts a dreadful experience.\nIts been hard, Lars.\nIts been hard to watch everything that\nyou guys do and you touch turn to gold\nand everything I do fucking backfire.\nAnd Im sure theres\na lot of people that\nthey would consider my backfire\ncomplete success.\nYou know? And am I happy\nbeing number two? No.\nYou know? Youre just now\nencountering something\nIve been going\nthrough years.\nIve never had a chance\nto be able to tell you without\ntalking to Lars, the guy in Metallica.\nNever talked to my little Danish\nfriend again. You know?\nI remember the day you and I talked\nabout digging a hole in fucking dirt\nand smoking hash\nthrough the ground.\nThat to me is the stuff thats, like--\nYou know? And weve never had\nvery many moments like that.\nDo I feel some guilt? Yes, I do.\nBut at the same time,\nits difficult for me to comprehend\nthat the only thing that you feel\nwhen you look back\non the last years\nis rooted in the Metallica thing.\nOkay.\nHave you ever thought what--?\nWhat Ive been through?\nI think Ive had an awareness\nof the pain I caused you.\nThats not what I said.\nOkay.\nDo you have any idea--?\n- Of what I put you through.\n- No, no, no, what I went through.\nI mean, people hate me\nbecause of you.\nYou know, I walk down the street,\nand I hear some piece of shit\nsay Metallica at me,\nand they do that to taunt me.\nI mean, when I would hear Metallica\non the radio,\nI would be like,\nGod, I have to turn this off,\nbecause I just keep thinking,\nI fucked up!\nRight.\nIve been waiting for this day\nfor a long time.\nYou know? And by no means\nis it done because\nsomebody else very important\nis not here.\nRight.\nDo I wish it was all over again,\nand you guys woke me up and say:\nHey, Dave, you know what?\nYou need to go to AA? Yeah.\nId give anything for that chance.\nIs there any last words you wanna\nsay to everybody out there?\nMetal up your ass!\nOkay, thank you. This is Donna Davis,\nand this is Metallica.\nThis is, like, a pretty bitchin club\nto play the first fucking gig.\n- Yeah.\n- How do you guys feel?\n- Stoked.\n- Freaking out.\n- Freaking out?\n- Totally. Totally.\nIts un-fucking-believable is what\nit comes down to. Can I say that?\n- You can say whatever you want.\n- Its fucking unbelievable.\nEchobrain. Yeah.\nI dont know, I just-- All of a sudden\nthis became such a big production.\nI dont understand.\nIts like all of a sudden, like--\nI get one phone call, its like everybody\nand their fucking brother are in town.\nI thought itd be Jason, like,\nplaying with his new band\nin front of, you know, like, drunks\ndown at some bar or something.\nAnd now, I guess, to my own\nignorance or something, l--\nThats what-- I guess thats\nwhat I wanted it to be.\nSo now Im realizing that supposedly\nits a little more of a big deal than that.\n- Hey, whats happening, man?\n- Whats going on?\n- Sounded good, man. Very good.\n- Thanks. Thanks, man, thanks.\n- Awesome. Awesome.\n- Oh, thanks. Right on.\n- Im Lars. How you doing?\n- Nice to meet you.\nWheres Jason?\n- Jas?\n- I dont know.\nI think he went back to--\nI think he already fucking bailed.\n- He went back to--\n- Really?\nNice. Go back to say hey,\nand hes, like, fucking gone.\nElvis has left the building.\nTheres Zach. Hey, Zach.\nSee, hes even blowing me off.\nJason blows me off.\nZach blows me off.\nHow quick we become\nyesterdays news.\nNo-- No kidding.\nSee, theres a guy\nin an Echobrain T-shirt.\nYeah, thats Steve over there.\nHe works at the studio with us.\nWell, he is.\n- Really?\n- Yeah.\nI remember that guy.\nI remember him.\nHe worked at the studio.\n- Which guy?\n- Over there.\n- The guy in the red shorts?\n- No, the guy in the black\nthats walking across right now.\nKessel.\nTodd. He works at the studio too,\ndoesnt he?\n- Who?\n- Todd over there.\nIm sure theyre all here, Bob.\nI mean, the only two people\nin the Bay Area\nnot working for him is me and you.\nHetfields gonna freak.\nIm in fucking hell.\nThis whole gig has brought\nall of this on.\nYes, it has.\nIts made me feel like--\n- You really wanna come clean.\n- It made me feel like such a loser.\nI mean, I cant hold my band together,\nyou know.\nI start records,\nI dont finish them.\nI fucking--\nJason is the future.\nMetallicas the past.\nIve never had a break like this\nin years.\nDo you know what I mean? And just--\nWhats been kind of getting me\nis just not knowing.\nYou know what I mean? Not knowing\nand not hearing, it just eats away at you.\n- Kirk talked to him.\n- I talked to James today.\nWhat did he say?\nHe basically said that,\nyou know, he just--\nHis familys the priority right now,\nand he needs time to work\non his family\nbefore he can reach out\nto his other family, being us.\nAnd that he loves us,\nand he just needs for us\nto understand that he needs time.\nAnd he also went on\nabout how difficult it was\ntalking to you about it,\nbecause he felt pressured.\nAnd, you know, he spoke\nabout how you always need\nto be in control of the situation or in\ncontrol of the schedule or whatever.\nAnd he said that this is a time\nhe needs complete control\nof the situation.\nAnd he said, you know, all the\nMarc Reiters and the Bob Rocks,\nall that stuff, you know, just has--\nI cant think of that right now.\nSo, you know, I got the feeling that\nhe kind of lumps in your relationship\nwith the business side of things,\nwhich was actually\nreally surprising to me.\nBut I think thats--\nYou know, that explains--\nI think that explains a lot\non why he hasnt spoken to you.\nWere just in limbo, and the longer\nJames chooses to stay away\nfrom dealing with us,\nthe further we drift apart.\nAnd I just feel so disrespected.\nAnd thats the key thing.\nWas the future of the group\never in doubt?\nEven when James went\ninto rehab, do you think?\nLars and I, we were wondering\nwhen James was going to finally feel\nlike he was in a situation\nwhere he can come back\nto the band.\nAnd after a certain amount of months,\nyou know, Lars and I started to think:\nWell, is he ever gonna come back\nto the band?\nAnd that was a really big question\non our plates.\nWhether or not, you know,\nhe wanted to come back.\nJames wrote something in the new\nissue of our magazine, So What!\nHe wrote a kind of\na little handwritten note.\nThat note was probably\nthe most heartfelt thing\nthat Id ever seen come\nfrom his mind.\nTomorrow is shaping up,\nor is gearing itself up to be,\nyes, the first sit-down\nwith one James Hetfield post-rehab.\nWhy are we filming this?\nI dont know.\nWere in very different places.\nOr at least I am in a very different\nplace than I was from the Presidio.\nThats a huge understatement.\nSo we just have to find that if--\nYou know, if the movie will be\nas intense, you know.\nTo me there was a lot of intrusion,\nand I kind of went with it and felt--\nI felt uncomfortable.\nI felt uncomfortable with it.\nYou know, a boom\nfollowing me around,\nand it just felt like I was\nin the spotlight all the time.\nAnd I didnt--\nI guess I dont really like that feeling.\nWhile we were in the Presidio\nfilming you guys playing,\n- did you feel it then too?\n- Yeah.\nIt was-- It was pretty much\nall the time.\nDo you think youre\nin a better place now?\n- We gotta find some...\n- Im definitely in a better place.\nSome place that\nmakes you feel comfortable.\nAnd the last thing we wanna do\nis have it impede on your music,\nbecause thats more important\nthan anything.\nYou know, one answer\nmay be there--\nMaybe there shouldnt be a film.\nI mean, thats the range of possibilities\nthat we should really think about,\nbecause, I mean,\nwhy do you guys want a film?\nEven you said you hope\nthat the film is made. I mean--\nThats a big question,\nbecause, for me, it was really just--\nIt came along with being in Metallica.\nHey, were gonna do this.\nOh, okay.\nThats part of this, all of this...\nThe bigness of Metallica,\nand Im kind of tired of it.\nYou might look at it as a friend.\nTo me, its been a beast.\nAnd its sucked a lot of me into it.\nYou were maybe the keeper\nof the beast at one point.\nYou know, because you were the\nchampion of that fifth-- That entity.\nAnd, of course,\nyou gotta find the right balance\nbetween what\neverybodys personal needs are,\nbut if Metallica collectively decides\nto do this,\nthen I think Metallica\ncan make it happen.\nI dont know. That scares me again.\nMetallica is three individuals.\nAnd three individuals have to decide\nif its good to do.\nBut I still think that the priority\nis the collective\nuntil all the people involved\nin the collective\nsay that the priority\nis the individual.\nAnd so far, youre the only one\nthat said the priority is the individual.\nI havent said that.\nHe hasnt said that.\nI havent heard him say that.\nSo I feel that its still--\nTheres still an unbalance there.\nWe met from, like, maybe,\nI dont know, six or eight weeks\nbefore we actually picked up\nthe project again.\nThat was when we came in,\nand it was the first time\nwe actually used this studio, HQ.\nAnyway, here we are. HQ.\nRight on. Well, were here.\nAnd the cameras here.\nAnd my friend the boom is here.\n- Hovering.\n- Yeah. Cool.\nDo you want me to play the music?\nYeah, lets go. Im--\nIll put the big speakers on.\nI was afraid to pick up a guitar\nand fearful of what would happen.\nWould I not like it? Would I love it?\nWould I not be able to write\nanything cool?\nWould I write just recovery stuff?\nJames.\nIt was probably the best sound\nIve ever heard in my life,\njust the fact that you\nwere playing guitar in here.\n- Hey, Zach.\n- Right on, brother.\nPlay a riff.\n- What?\n- Nothing.\nSee? It feels pretty good, doesnt it?\n- Yeah.\n- It feels like the next day.\nA year later, the next day.\nIt will be interesting\nworking on this schedule,\nbecause we really havent.\nIts gonna be great.\nAnd kind of the overview is, you know,\nthe less time we have here,\nthe more productive well be,\nin a way, you know?\nIts like were more focused\non getting the stuff done.\nThat all sounds really good.\nOkay. Now, lets revisit it in a week.\nSo I think that, dont talk it, walk it.\nAt some point, we are gonna\nhave to work a little harder.\n- Yes.\n- You know, when that feels right.\nWhat do you mean?\nWhat does that mean?\n- What does that mean?\n- Yeah.\nWhen you say harder,\ndoes that mean more hours?\nYou know, if we can go deep\nreal quick,\nbe intense...\nI spoke up because,\nWhat does that mean,\nwe have to, you know,\ndo eight hours now?\n- And I got fearful right then.\n- Thats okay.\nI mean, its like... Yeah.\n- To do eight hours?\n- No.\nAny lyric ideas?\nIm searching for--\nSearching for doughnuts.\n- Searching for doughnuts\n- Searching for doughnuts\nWhat was the whole thing\nfrom yesterday?\n- The Buddhist--\n- Guarantee-- What?\nNo, the Buddhist thing that you had.\nBirth is pain, life is pain,\ndeath is pain.\nThe cycle of suffering.\nIts called samsara.\nWhere are you with this, James?\nSomewhere else.\nWheres todays sweat going?\nIve worn out being afraid.\nMy endless parade\nof fear that Ive constantly made.\nMy lifestyle determines\nmy deathstyle.\nA rising tide that pushes\nto the other side.\nIve worn out being afraid\nEndless parade\nOf fear that Ive constantly made\nFrantic tick tick tick tock\nI gladly trade\nOh, I need know the answer\nWhere Ill be laid\nI cant find it\n- It just-- It doesnt work.\n- The great--\nYou did one great thing.\nYou went:\nYou did this one syncopated thing.\nDo the whole verse like that.\nIve worn out always being afraid\nAn endless stream of fear\nThat Ive made\nFrantic tick tick tock\nIll gladly trade\nIts weird. Its weird. And it works.\nNo, but the second time you felt\nreally comfortable with it.\n- Right.\n- Oh, by the way, its quarter to .\nI gotta get rolling, guys. Sorry.\nI feel like the bad guy saying,\nI gotta go because its : .\nIf we all know, and we all do know,\nthat : is kind of the stop time,\nthen, I dont know, then I wont feel\nlike the heel here, saying:\nI gotta go eat dinner\nwith my kids, you know.\nBecause I have a feeling\nIm gonna walk out of here,\nand youre gonna go in there\nand listen to this stuff,\n- and its like, thats not right.\n- Thats not.\nI mean, if I wanna listen to it,\nIll go and listen to it.\nBut we should at least listen to it--\nBut I know youll sit there\nand start talking with Bob.\nMaybe Bob doesnt wanna sit\nin there, and when Im gone,\nthings get talked about\nand decisions are made.\nAnd I feel I walk into something\nthats already kind of decided.\nAnd its a total uphill battle\nfor me a lot of times.\nI dont like that feeling.\nWell, thats, like,\njust like the last years,\n- Yeah.\n- for me.\nWell, lets talk about this\ntomorrow, then, all right?\n- Or do you wanna take time out--?\n- No, I dont have time right now,\nbecause its past .\nIts hard to introduce structure\ninto this, and Im trying.\nSo, what do you think, Lars?\nCan we hear the song\nfrom yesterday?\nThat we all heard together?\nHow is that different?\nBecause we all heard it\ntogether already.\n- He wants to be part of everything.\n- Was I in there?\nYes, you were.\nWe all heard it together yesterday.\n- You came in.\n- All right.\nAs long as you dont talk about it.\n- Is that a way around it, or--?\n- That is definitely a way around it.\nHow about if we just save up\nthe tension?\nSeriously. I mean, thats okay,\nbecause tension produces results.\nIm excited to see\nwhat you learned here.\nUp and back. Up and freeze.\nWhat is this called?\nArabesque.\nSuper proud of you, sweetie.\nIm so glad I got to see it.\nIm working on--\nReally hard, on being\nthe best dad and father\nand husband I can be.\nAnd the best me.\nYou worked hard.\nI dont wanna lose\nany of the stuff I have.\nI know it could all go away\nat one time,\nand thats a tough part of life.\nAnd then-- And its just--\nIts a total rebirth for me,\nlooking at life in a whole new way.\nYou know, all the other drinking and\nall the other junk that I was stuck in,\nit was so predictable, so boring.\nIm out there looking for excitement\nin all this stuff.\nThe results are the same, man.\nI wake up the next day somewhere\nin some bed,\nI dont know who this person\nis next to me,\nand Im drunk, completely hung-over\nand have a show to do.\nAnd the result is the same.\nYou know?\nWhen life now is pretty exciting.\nYou dont know\nwhats gonna happen\nwhen youre kind of clear\nand here and in the now.\nIn the moment.\nMy lifestyle determines\nMy deathstyle\nA rising tide\nThat pushes to the other side\nMy lifestyle determines\nMy deathstyle\nA rising tide\nThat pushes to the other side\nI think those two feel the best to me.\nIts a tough one to decide.\nThey all kind of got\nsome charm, dont you think?\nYeah, Id be interested to hear\nthe first one.\nFrom the first take.\nWell, lets play it.\n- Is it okay?\n- Are we allowed?\n- Yeah, we are.\n- Do we have--?\n- We never really settled that, did we?\n- We didnt settle it.\nYes. Were allowed.\nWell, Id like to hear it.\nFeel free to leave the room, whoever\ndoesnt want to be part of that.\nI felt like it was an agreement.\nWere gonna work from to\nand then we would not work.\nWell, if Lars and I\nlisten to something\nor go through the Presidio stuff,\nits not because we wanna do\nsomething behind your back.\nIts for you.\nAnd basically what I heard\nis, No, I cant do that.\n- What the fuck is that?\n- I dont know, my mind gets lopsided.\nThe more it goes in a different\ndirection, the harder it is.\nThe harder it is to get that back.\nWhat is it you have to get back?\nSome control. Some sense\nof involvement in the band.\nWhen I was running this morning,\nI was thinking about seeing you today,\nand the word fuck\njust comes up so much.\nSeriously, its really true.\n- Is that in anger?\n- No, just, Fuck!\nFuck.\nI just think youre\nso fucking self-absorbed.\nAnd what makes it worse is\nthat you always talk about...\nYou always talk about me.\nYou use the word control\nand manipulation a lot.\nI think you control on purpose,\nand I think you control inadvertently.\nI think you control by the rules\nyou always set.\nI think you control by how you\nalways judge people.\nI think you control by your absence.\nI think you control all of this\neven when youre not here.\nI dont understand who you are.\nI dont understand the program.\nI dont understand all this stuff,\nokay?\nI realize now that I barely\nknew you before.\nAnd all these rules\nand all this shit, man,\nthis is a fucking rock n roll band.\nI dont want fucking rules.\nI understand that you need\nto leave at .\nI respect it.\nBut dont tell me I cant sit and listen to\nsomething with Bob at : if I want to.\nWhat the fuck is that?\nYou know, I dont wanna end up\nlike Jason, okay?\nI dont want to be pushed away.\nI dont want it to happen twice.\nLets do it, and lets fucking do it\nfull-on or lets not do it at all.\nFuck. See?\nFuck.\nFuck!\nFuck!\nYeah!\n- Yeah!\n- Metallica. Yeah!\nRock n roll.\nLets hear it for Elena!\nWere not anywhere near\ngetting any issues resolved.\nWell, lets get them.\nThats what were here to do.\nI dont know. I guess the playing part,\nbeing in the room,\nand then mainly being in the room\nwith Lars, playing music together.\nI guess I had higher expectations,\nand I dont know,\nmaybe Im disappointed in myself.\nMaybe... I dont know.\nYou wanna talk about that?\nI mean, what does that mean?\nIm not enjoying being in the room\nwith you playing.\nSearching\nSeek and destroy\nSearching\nSeek and destroy\nSearching, yeah\nSeek and destroy\nIf you are not having any fun,\nlet me let it be known to you that\nIm not having a lot of fun either.\nBut Ive-- I am not interested\nin playing music with you\nif youre not happy in there.\nI just dont want to be a--\nBecome a fucking parody.\nOkay? So if youre not happy\nplaying music with me:\nIs there enough that connects us\nto hold on\nfor a way through this?\nI dont know.\nThere are moments\nwhere I really doubt it.\nReally doubt it.\nIm glad you said that.\nBecause I really, deep down,\nfeel sometimes that its just...\nTheres just some empty, just...\nJust an ugly feeling inside.\nJust... I dont know.\nHow much work\ndo we gotta put into this?\n- Then youre doing the:\n- Yeah.\nLets do our little roundtable thing\nright now, quickly.\nEverybodys gotta participate.\nLars, come on.\nHey, Castor, why dont you look at all\nthe boys-- The men, I should say.\nAnd say bye to everybody.\nBye, Castor.\nThank you for coming.\n- Is Daddy going bye?\n- No, your dadas staying here, okay?\n- Bye, guys.\n- See you.\nSo, whats the deal? How does\neverybody feel about what they heard?\nThe chorus lyrics will definitely work\nin that feel.\n- Yeah.\n- That kind of intro bit thats on there.\n- What about you? What do you think?\n- Its good.\nYou think its good? Was there\nanything in particular that you...?\nNo, I wasnt paying attention\nthat detailed.\nThats just-- Its a lot of good stuff.\nI can take you back, when me and him\nwere alone in my room, in\nlistening to the new wave of\nBritish heavy-metal singles.\nAs soon as there was somebody else\nin the room,\nit just became this, like-- It just had\na very different energy to it.\n- Is there any of that thats usable?\n- Yeah.\n- Thats a fuck-- Thats a fucking bitch.\n- Lets do another version of it, okay?\nThe first time I got\na real awareness of it\nwas when Mustaine came\ninto the picture.\nWhen James was with Mustaine,\nhe became like he never\nreally cared about me.\nOne time during the recording\nof the Ride the Lightning record,\nwhere me and him went out and--\nSo beers later,\nit was like, Oh, dude, I love you.\nBut it could never have materialized\nuntil it got to that -beer point\nand we were alone.\nThat was good.\nAre you sure I dont have\nto play it again?\nYeah, Im sure.\nIts good practice, though.\n- For what?\n- The road.\n- When?\n- A couple years.\nFrom day one, its been competitive.\nAnd in a way, thats what has made\nMetallica what it is.\nThats whats driven us further.\nWhat feels good to you?\nI dont know.\nIm gonna try a bunch more.\nCan you try maybe like a:\nAlmost like a strum.\nMy parents split\nwhen I was or .\nAnd then my mom passed on\nwhen I was .\nThe only thing I felt that I really had,\nat that point, was music.\nMy wanting to keep everything\nunder control,\nand, you know, its out of a fear\nof my abandonment issues.\nIm afraid to get close to people\nbecause I dont know how to do it.\nI dont know\nhow youre supposed to do it.\n- Cool.\n- That last one was pretty good.\nYes.\nThats the first amp I ever owned.\nThat right there.\nI think we have it.\nOkay.\nOkay. Now we gotta talk about it.\nYou started talking about the idea of\nthe guitar solo, as we have known it,\nmaybe being something that was\na little outdated\nand maybe reintroducing\nsome riff-o-rama things.\nBut can I say something\nthat I think is bullshit?\nThis whole fucking solo out,\nyou know, dates the whole thing.\nThats so bullshit. You know?\nIf you put a guitar-- If you dont play\na guitar solo in one of these songs,\nthat dates it to this period.\nAnd that cements it to a trend\nthats happening in music right now.\nI think thats stupid,\nand I think its totally trendy.\nI know thats not what I said.\nIts always been about,\nlike, where could it go\nthats kind of new and interesting,\ninstead of just repeating\nsomething from the past.\nIm not interested in playing\ntraditional guitar solos anymore.\n- You know, thats just-- For me, its--\n- And you told me that.\nIts just boring, you know.\nTo me, if you can add a colour\nto the song\nthat satisfies you and works\nfor the song,\nthen thats what we should do with it.\nBut I dont wanna get in the position\nwhere its like,\nwe put something down on the tape\nto satisfy your ego,\nmy ego, Lars ego or James ego.\nI think it should serve\nwhats going down.\nLike, in other words, there shouldnt be,\nlike, a rule of no solos.\nThere shouldnt be a rule of solos.\nIt should be--\nAnd I agree.\nI mean, it really is, to me,\nall about serving the song,\nand, you know,\nI feel much better about that,\nbecause, you know, I just dont wanna\nfollow certain trends\nthat I see other bands following.\nWe dont necessarily have\nto stick to our traditional way,\nbut we also dont have\nto follow that trend.\nIm actually very, very comfortable\nwith my role in the band, you know?\nIve actually always been very, very\ncomfortable with my role in the band.\nIm not a really egotistical person.\nIn fact, Ive-- I spend a large\namount of my time trying to, like,\ndownplay my ego\nand get it even smaller and smaller.\nThats part of my beliefs.\nI try to be an example\nof being egoless to the other guys.\nHi! This is Kirk from Metallica.\nAnd if you want money,\nyoull listen to us.\nAnd then some other guys\ngonna give you cash.\nTwenty years worth of integrity,\nand, you know,\ncredibility and all that.\nThe next five minutes\nis gonna change all that.\nHey, man, keep it locked right here,\nand-- What?\nWell help you score $ .\nThis is James from Metallica.\nSurvey says, you need cash.\nYour money-shot to snatch\na bunch of cash is coming soon.\nIn order to suck both\nnationwide radio chains off,\nwe are now standing here\nhaving to do this fucking stupid thing.\nUp to motherfucking grand,\ngoddamn it!\nWin a bunch of money.\nAnd walk away.\nThis is stupid!\nSharpen that booger-picking finger\nand be the th--\nHey, its Lars from Metallica. Im\nabout to stick grand up your ass.\nOne dollar at a time.\nI was telling Lars last night\nthat was hard for me to see\n- you guys squirm like you were.\n- Yeah.\nBecause I wanted to say anything,\nand its not my place to say anything.\nI cant imagine Bono or the Edge\ngoing on the radio,\nsaying what you guys\nare being asked to say.\n- Dad, can I have one of those?\n- Go for it.\nShould we catch up\non all this radio stuff?\nOkay. Now, theyre\nthe biggest chain in America.\nYou know, its like stations\nor something.\nAnd if you guys think its crappy, as a\nradio thing, those guys think its good.\nI mean, thats their idea.\nWe didnt come up with that.\nSo strategically--\nWhy are we doing it, then?\nJust to make them happy?\nYes.\nThats exactly what theyre doing.\nAnd they wont say, Fuck you,\nyou never do anything for us.\nWere gonna fuck you\non the next record. \nPeople would do that?\nBecause you didnt give us something,\nwere gonna fuck you?\nYes, James. They would.\nIm not saying that they\ncan always get away with it.\nThats so funny.\n- It wouldnt stop them from trying.\n- Im glad its your world.\nI understand the wash your back,\nyou wash mine thing.\nWash my-- Ill wash your back\nso you dont stab mine,\n- Right.\n- is more like it.\nOkay. Why dont we get off\nthe phone, then.\nWell, you know, we should have this\nconversation some more next week.\n- Later.\n- Okay.\n- See you.\n- Bye-bye.\nThats insanity. Were gonna hurt you\nbecause we didnt get something.\nI wash your back\nso you dont stab mine.\nWell, thats a good line for a song.\nI guess I just want something\nto rhyme with mine right now.\nWash your back so you wont...\nWash your back\nso you wont stab mine.\nStep on a landmine.\nKeep you in my back pocket.\nBlind leading the blind.\nIll rip out your fucking spine.\nOkay.\nAll right.\nWash your back\nSo you wont stab mine\nGet in bed with your own kind\nWash your back\nSo you wont stab mine\nGet in bed with your own kind\n- That was really good.\n- Are you pulling my mike?\n- That was really good.\n- It was.\n- Really good.\n- So then, the part--\nLandmine\nLandmine\nNo landmines\nNo landmines\nRock lobster\nWash your back\nSo you wont stab mine\nGet in bed with your own kind\nTheres a witch at the foot of my bed.\nDid you--?\nDid you hear what Lars said?\nHe says, Yeah, Kirk stopped reading,\nand I stopped moping.\n- Thats what you said.\n- Thats not what I said.\n- Whatd you say?\n- I said, I stopped sulking.\nOh, sulking.\nShit!\nIn the months since hes\nparted company with Metallica,\nex-bassist Jason Newsted has been\napparently more musically active\nthan his former band mates.\nWhile Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich\nwas pursuing Napster,\nand singer James Hetfield\nbattled alcoholism,\nNewsted hooked up in the studio\nwith legendary metal band Voivod.\nOur own lann Robinson got all the\nanswers on Newsteds new ventures\nand the current state\nof his relationship with Metallica.\nA good friend hinted\nthat Jason would really like\nto join the band again.\nMan, I popped his little bubble\nfor a second and-- I dont know, man.\nIll be quite honest.\nI think the heart and soul of Metallica,\nfrom this point on,\nand has been for a while, since\nCliff died, is the three of you guys.\nI think you will never, ever, ever find\na permanent bass player.\nMy opinion.\nThere was also tragedy\nin rock this week.\nMetallicas bassist Cliff Burton\nwas killed in a bus accident\nwhile the band was on tour\nin Sweden. He was .\nMetallica bassist Cliff Burton\nwas buried on Tuesday\nin the San Francisco area.\nRemaining members of the band...\nJason Newsted.\nHe replaced Cliff Burton,\nwho was killed in an auto accident\nin September.\nJason told...\nIt pisses me off that Cliff left us\nbecause wed never have\nthat initial four guys\njust going on and on.\nYou know, when I talk about it,\nits like that happened for a reason.\nAnd were-- Were dealing with that.\nI gotta capitalize\non whats being said right here.\nThe Cliff message that I get\nfrom him to you guys is,\nthat treasure the three of you.\nTreasure every moment\nthat the three of you have.\nAnd the four of you have.\nYou know, treasure--\nTreasure it because you never know.\nAnd one of the sad things\nthat happens when somebody dies\nis that people have never\ntaken the time along the way\nto really embrace each other\nevery day. You know?\nIts a sin if you--\nYou know, if you let that go.\nPhil has been like an angel for me.\nHes been sent to help me.\nAnd, you know, Ive got\nmy own thoughts about all that,\nyou know, a father figure,\nthe dad that never was\nand all of that, that it makes\nme comfort--\nIt comforts me.\nBut also, we dont want to have\nour hand held through life.\nWed like to be able to stand proud\nourselves and move on.\nTherell be a time for that.\nAnd we just have to discuss\nwhen that is.\nYou know, there is purpose\nbehind the way I do it.\nI think its very effective.\nI have to decide whether\nIm going to push it or not.\nIt sometimes is a distraction.\nSo, what part of our career\nare you gonna manage today?\nI thought Id do the whole thing,\nsince you guys cant do anything.\nIf you guys could run something,\nthen it would be easy to step back.\nBecause you cant, you know...\nIs today the first day youre\ngonna play drums?\n- I dont wanna get into that.\n- Okay.\nNo. I dont think\nIm gonna do the drums.\n- I think its time--\n- Maybe I should.\n- Yeah. I think its time.\n- Although, actually, Im kind of...\nWell, its about the only thing\nyou havent done.\n- I havent sung.\n- Right.\nWe got to a point\nwhere we sat down and told Phil\nthat we wanted to scale Phil back\nto every other week.\nAnd we were getting ready\nto implement that\nfour weeks from when\nthe decision was made.\nAnd two weeks\nafter the decision was made,\nwe had to sit Phil down and say\nthat we were not ready to do that.\nBecause we got really...\nI dont know. Scared, I guess.\nThere were some things\nthat were going on at the time\nthat, really, Phil helped with a lot.\nLive from the news leader\nin Northern California.\nNewsCenter .

Napster battlefield\nmoved to San Mateo today.\nMetallica drummer Lars Ulrich\ndelivered a list of screen names\nof people who have downloaded\nthe bands music online.\nMetallica is suing Napster,\na website that provides software\nwhich allows people to download\nmusic on the Internet without paying.\nMetallica drummer Lars Ulrich testified\nbefore a Senate committee\nearlier this month that Napster has\nhijacked our music without asking.\nThe band said\nthat over people\nare downloading its music for free.\nA group of former Metallica fans\nstaged a protest at the courthouse.\nI dont want anything to do\nwith Metallica anymore.\nIm gonna be trashing their CDs.\nI took all my CDs,\nand Im gonna be destroying them.\nAre you proud\nof what you achieved with Napster?\nAre you proud in hindsight\nof what you pulled off?\nBeing the most hated man\nin rock n roll?\nYeah, that was-- That was my goal.\nI got an idea.\nIm kind of bored this summer.\nEverythings going a little too well.\nLets see, I wanna turn myself\ninto the most hated fucking\nasshole in rock n roll, yeah.\nLike, good afternoon, my name is, you\nknow, like, Lars Ulrich, from Metallica.\nI worked for years to get\nwhere I am today.\nMe and my buddy\nJames Hetfield here\nhave shed blood, sweat and beer\nto get where we are today.\nBeer, good.\nWho do you think you are?\nI mean, just, you know,\nbecause you, like, made us rich,\nyou think you can get free stuff?\nSongs that we spent upwards\nof, you know,\nlike to hours writing\nand recording.\nOur team of lawyers and researchers\nhave your names,\nand you Napster users, well see you\nin jail getting gang-raped.\nSome minutes\nI have all this strength,\nand I can stand there and just go,\nFuck you, fuck you, fuck you.\nIm bulletproof, it doesnt matter.\nI got Hetfield and Hammett,\nand were a team, and fuck you.\nYou know what I mean?\nFive minutes later,\nit means nothing, and I just\nbecome really vulnerable.\nYou know,\nwe never sat there and thought\nabout where Napster\nwas gonna end up.\nWe never sat there and talked about\nwhat shots we were gonna take.\nWe just sat there and thought about,\nthis was something we had to do.\nSo wait a sec.\nThat was awesome!\nIts like I had to stay\non the course that I was on\nand stay to my convictions,\nbut it was eating away at me inside.\nAnd then maybe it could go\nlyrically to:\nWhat difference did l/we actually\nmake? Its a great question. Great.\nAnd if that could-- Its like if that\nquestion could get thrown out there,\nbut remain unanswered,\nI think thats really strong.\nAll the shots I take\nWhat difference did I make?\nAll the shots I take\nI spit back at you\nAll the shots I spit back at you.\nThats awesome, dude.\nFucking...\n- Fuck me.\n- And the what difference did I make\n- fit right in.\n- Really awesome. Right on.\nThese two kicks,\nare they the same as--?\n- Its different.\n- Okay.\nGo to the master.

Hes Pollock,\nthe funnel-arranger guy.\nIts gonna sound fucking amazing\nat the stadium\nwith people\nfucking raising the evil horns\nup to the sky and saying,\nMetallica, baby.\nOh, can we fast-forward\nto that right now?\nI think what Id like to do is,\nId like to talk about\nthis touring thing that has come up.\nWere very cognizant of the fact\nthat things have changed\nfor you guys.\nAnd theyve changed\nfor many, many reasons.\nWhy cant we figure out what works\nbest for everybody\nin their personal lives,\nplus what works best as a business?\nWhat if you just do a stadium tour,\nwhere you play Friday, Saturday\nand Sunday,\nand then you go home\nthe rest of the week?\nI just wanna put out that,\nyou know, it might be a kind\nof uncomfortable vibe here\nbecause people might not know\nhow Im feeling about touring,\nand I dont really know either.\nYou know? Until I get there.\nAnd, you know, I wanna tour.\nI dont wanna fall off the wagon,\nyou know.\nI dont wanna go out there--\nI dont know what its like.\nDoing things for the first time again, as\nI think Ive said before, its a little scary.\nI dont know about you,\nbut its, like, summertime.\nAnd to me, its fucking\nbeer-drinking weather, yeah?\nYeah. Well, Im gonna take time\nright now and fucking have myself one,\nand I just wanna say cheers\nto all you guys\nand fucking thanks for coming down\nand getting nutty with us. Cheers.\nI blew my voice out\non the Black Album,\ndoing So What, the cover song.\nAnd we had a bunch of Metallica\nsongs to do after that.\nAnd I went to this coach. I didnt--\nI didnt wanna go. I was scared.\nI thought he was gonna make me\nsing operatic.\nBut I went there,\nand we just did warm-up stuff like this,\nand this is the tape. And Ive had\nthis same tape for-- Since then.\n- Was there a turning point?\n- Yeah.\nI think when we had accumulated\nwhat we thought to be,\nyou know, a great kind of...\nI dont know,\ncross section of material,\nwe took stock, so to speak.\nThe only songs that\nare gonna make it to the album\nare the songs that\nall four of us vote on.\nAnd out of -plus songs,\nonly four songs got all four votes.\nSweet Amber\nSweet Amber\nSweet Amber\nHow sweet are you?\nHow sweet does it get?\nHow sweet are you?\nHow sweet does it get?\n- Yeah, right.\n- Wow.\nI mean, theres some explosive playing.\nThe shit just takes off.\nIts like you guys have spent\nall this time\nto come back to find yourselves.\n- Thats what it sounds like to me.\n- All right, to go.\nYeah, how are you doing?\nDo you wanna hear more?\n- Wanna hear more?\n- Im just getting started.\nSqueeze all within my hands\nChoke within my hands\nIm madly in anger with you\nIm madly in anger with you\nIm madly in anger with you\nTime, time, times like this\n- Boy\n- You got what youre coming to\n- So\n- Destruct the power within all\nAcross your spine\nSo that gets broken too\nTemptation, fill no hole\nNo\nNo, no\nTemptation\nYou know, the first four songs\nyouve played me,\nall pretty much knocked me out.\nOkay? But if youve got it going, you\nwant it to hammer all the way through.\nYou want people to be able\nto really listen and say:\nJesus Christ, theres\nno letting up from these guys.\nTheres no fucking letup.\nFuck ballads. You know?\nThere definitely is some Presidio stuff\nthat I felt, maybe--\nYou gotta analyse it. Maybe youre\nwatering it down in some way.\nThats all.\n- Its your call.\n- Yeah.\nI know that...\nTemptation,\nI remember writing that thing.\nIt came out.\nIt flowed, totally, instantly.\nTemptation kind of sums up\nall the lyrics\nthat are in this new kind of project.\nSo-- And that-- And its cool\nbecause that was done\nlong before recovery\nand all that, so...\nI mean, I can tell that youre singing\nyour heart out.\nYoure definitely wearing your heart\non your sleeve on that song.\nTo me, its more like a jam.\nIs there a song in there?\nPotentially.\nYou know, theres almost nothing\nthere that cant be turned\ninto something better than it is\nor something\nthat could probably\nget pretty fucking close\nto being something\non a Metallica record.\nYou know, but then it just goes away\nfrom what the purpose--\nAt least, what I see the purpose\nbeing today,\nwhich is show up with what you--\nYou know, what are your A-pluses?\nYou know?\nWell, when I hear Lars talk\nabout We can whip anything\ninto decent shape, I agree.\nAnd we did that on\nLoad and ReLoad.\nAnd this is us trying to choose\nbefore we take it to those extremes,\nyou know?\n- Exactly.\n- That makes sense.\nThat was a pretty major thing that I\nthink Lars and I clicked on together,\nthat, wow, Id heard him,\nand he heard me.\nOh, its like, Oh, okay.\nIts like it takes the cutting edge\noff of it\nor the personal attack off of it,\nyou know?\nThings are a lot less dramatic\nthan they used to be\nwithin the chemistry\nof the four of us.\nLess head games, abuse of power\nand soap-opera bullshit.\nBut can we just do one thing?\nFor lack of a better word,\nwhen it comes in with the drums,\nI just want you to scream,\nFuck,\nas hard as you can fucking scream.\nFuck\nOkay. It should be slower.\nIt should be more like:\nI want four of them. Do it again.\nLars is selling paintings\nbecause hes ready to move on\nto the next ten years\nor next decade\nor next phase of his life.\nAnd a lot of what these paintings and\na lot of what this house represents\nis the last ten years versus\na husband and father of two.\nHes getting rid of some pretty\nmajor and important pieces\nin the majority of his collection.\nHes wiping the slate clean.\nMidnight, New York City.\nOne last look at the paintings.\nOh, well.\n- Its a celebration.\n- This is a celebration.\n- Of how far youve come.\n- Its a celebration.\nWith Phil Towle.\nThis is a celebration.\nSome paintings have visited us\nfor a while.\nAnd now we wanna share them\nwith other people.\n- Okay?\n- Right, yeah. Thats it.\n- Its a choice.\n- Okay, cool.\nI never looked at it as an investment,\nbut I always looked it as--\nVersus some of the other guys\nthat may be, like, taking\na big pile of money and parking\nit in the bank,\nI would always, like, take a big pile\nof money and park it on my wall.\nI can just feel some of the adulation\nthat other people have thrown\nat these paintings,\nand that makes me proud.\nIve never been this close to it.\nThese are great paintings, whether\nthey sell for a dollar or for $ million.\nThe only thing that matters\nis what pleasure\nand what feeling you get out of that\nmoment you have with that painting.\nAnd its never been\nabout dollars and cents.\nIts always been about something\ngreater than that.\nBut, fuck, they do look awesome.\nI mean, fuck.\nIts been a good time.\n- And it will be a good time.\n- To the future.\nI feel better about this\nthan I thought I would, actually.\n- Its weird, I dont know why.\n- Yeah.\nShit.\n$ .\n$\non the telephone.\nIts two of you in the room,\nselling right, fair warning at $ .\nJean Paul, $ .\nTwenty-one is the moderna\non the reverse,\nthe Jean-Michel Basquiat showing\non the screen there on my right.\n- All right, here we go.\n- Be strong, my friend.\n$ . At $ . million.\n. million.\n$ .\n$ .\n- Can we get more cocktails?\n- $ --\n- .\n- . . .\n- .\n- $ million.\n- Come on, .\n- For you, sir, $ .\n$ .\nAnd selling at $ million.\nBrett, yours at million.\n- All right.\n- Hi.\nIt went well.\nI got myself drunk to numb the pain.\nBut it went well. Im happy.\nLike, lets talk about the zone\nfor a minute.\nBecause there is a way to help\na person-- Persons get in a zone.\nTo-- I mean, you could consider\nseriously doing some meditative,\nor apply the meditative principles\nto music, all right?\nI dont want this to sound\ntoo way-out,\nbut if you do that,\nthe four of you are out there,\nand you do it anyway, unconsciously,\nyou do a musical meditation\nby starting to jam with each other.\nI just think,\nno matter how you look at it,\nIve been making records a very\nlong time, and it really comes down\nto how much work you put in\nand how much...\nYou know, its just tough. Sometimes\nits just-- Its just tough work.\nAnd I like to stretch the frontiers\nof what people accept, okay?\nAnd I understand about that.\nAnd l--\nI dont want, for my mind, to settle...\nI guess Im not gonna\nbe playing today, then, huh?\nWell, Im gonna go out\nand make phone calls.\nSo everybodys...\nYou know, weve had\na fabulous few weeks\nwith a lot of great productivity,\na lot of really good stuff going on.\nThe more we feel good\nabout ourselves and each other\nand the higher we ascend,\nthe more challenging\nit will be to our psyches.\nYou know, I understand it.\nI embrace it and all that stuff,\nbut sometimes it just bugs me.\nI think the-- That thing was\nkind of bugging me yesterday.\nAll of them around the studio,\nit was just kind of, like--\nThat way of thinking, it just\ndoesnt work for me all the time.\nAnd I was a little pissed off at it,\nbecause right now in my life\nits not really working for me.\n- Im glad to know thats how you feel.\n- I agree with that wholeheartedly.\nAnd if you feel that way\nand wish to share that more directly,\n- Id appreciate that too.\n- Rather than tearing the signs down?\n- Yeah.\n- We pay him $ a month\nto be pretty much available\nat our beck and call.\nSo when this records done,\ndo we want to collectively end\nthe $ -a-month, full-on thing?\nIm afraid hes under the impression\nthat hes, like, in the band, you know?\nYeah.\nAnd I see him coming on the road,\nmaybe, for a week.\nBut after that I dont-- I dont see him\nholding our hand\nany further than that.\nSo is that something we wanna\npresent to him, then?\n- Yeah. I think that--\n- Okay.\nI think its something--\nYeah, I think its something\nwe need to do\nfor our own well-being.\nYeah, because\nIm feeling uncomfortable.\nYeah, hello? Hello, hello.\nAre they on the phone?\nTheyre on the phone,\nand they need you.\nOh, okay.\n- James Hetfield is in the room.\n- Hey there.\n- Hey, James, how you doing?\n- Pretty good.\nIll let Marc do the talking. Hes\nthe one whos been talking to MTV.\nOkay, this afternoon,\nthe official offer came in for ICON.\n- Assuming you wanna do it.\n- Lets do it.\nCool, man.\nYeah, Im jazzed about it.\nThe only thing that you guys\nare required to do\nis show up for rehearsal\nand then show up\nfor the show on the rd,\nand at the end of the show\nyou guys take the stage\nand perform a little bit.\n- So, whats Jasons role in all this?\n- What? Who?\nCliff? I mean,\nI dont think Jason has any role.\nHe lost his icon status\nwhen he left Metallica.\n- Nice one, Cliff.\n- Thank you.\nI think MTV would like the fact\nthat this would most likely be\nthe introductory performance\nof Metallica with a new bass player,\nwhether its the new member\nor whoever.\nWhen is it supposed to be?\nMay what?\nMay rd. Saturday, May rd.\nSee, that means youd have\nto hire someone by the nd.\n- Okay.\n- I think it can happen.\nYoud be required to be in\nLos Angeles for all of two days...\nBecause we didnt get a new\nbass player, I think a lot of people\nthought maybe that we were\nhaving trouble finding one.\nWe never started looking for a new\nbass player until two months ago.\nWe worked on ourselves,\nidentified what part can we work on\nso when someone else steps in,\nits clean.\nTheyre not stepping in our shit,\nyou know?\nAll right, thinking about\nbass players, finally?\nSo were gonna need\na fourth member.\nYou know, we know youre\na great bass player. Its the vibe.\nWe need to make sure...\nJason kind of triggered this whole thing\na couple of years ago.\nAnd I cant believe its been two years.\nAnd now weve gone through some...\nWe realized that we kind of wanted\nsomebody who was, like, our age.\nSomebody who had been\naround the block a couple times.\nWeve grown a lot, man.\nThese three guys\nand this band.\nAnd last time, when we did this\nyears ago,\nyears ago, I guess it was,\nwe literally sat down and started\nauditioning bass players,\nyou know, the day after\nthe funeral for Cliff.\nSo now its years later,\ndifferent circumstances.\nWhen Jason left,\nhe took his basses with him.\nDo you want a four or five?\nWhatever.\nWhat five-strings do you have?\nThis ones a five-string.\nKeep searching\nKeep on searching\nThis search goes on\nThis search goes on\nThe band-- These guys\ncollectively probably own,\nlike, five to guitars,\nso theyre not all here.\nOn and on\nTick tick tick tick tick tick tock\nFrantic\nTick tick tick tick tick tick tock\nFrantic\nTick tick tick tick tick tick tock\nFrantic\nTick tick tick tick tick tick tock\nYou went into\nanother voice there, dude.\nWhich one of me are you talking to?\nThink that we should just spend the\nnext two and a half hours with this guy.\nDont you?\nI had a vision of us jamming\nwith him the last hour.\nI guess I just feel this is just\nkind of, like, weird to keep,\nlike, just doing our own thing.\nIt just feels not welcoming.\nThis morning I heard him say\nhe was pretty comfortable.\nIts not about what he says.\nIts about what I feel.\n- All right?\n- Are we cool, James?\nYeah. I guess the only other thing\nId like to say is,\nyou know, when we leave this up\nto just how were feeling,\na lot of it depends\non how youre feeling.\nYou know,\nwhen you say those things.\nNot that I wanna break up\nwhat you guys are discussing,\nif you wanna go deeper, you know?\nBut I think what might be really good\nis to treat this with respect,\ngo out and do this...\nMetallica stuff?\n- I could try Battery.\n- Battery?\nYou can play that fast\nwith your fingers?\nBattery\nThats a fucking pretty mighty\nbass sound you got going there.\n- Yeah, its fucking--\n- I dont know.\nIts the Mesa and the Hiwatt.\nIs there anything else you know\nas well as that?\nCliff. It was just like you saw Cliff,\nand me and James went,\nHes in our band, theres no question.\nHe hit it out of the park.\nAnd thats where it\nsort of gets interesting.\nBecause if Cliff Burton\nshowed up today,\nmaybe he wouldnt be the guy either.\nI mean, the three guys that I like\nall have unique features\nthat I would love to Frankenstein,\nyou know?\n- Yeah! Definitely.\n- Some kind of monster?\nThat would be great.\nI dont think you should settle.\nI think you should get the right guy.\nIf you dont hit it out of the park\nwith one of these guys,\nthen youre gonna end up\nfour years down the road\nin the same situation you did\nwith Jason.\nA four count, then...\nAnd into the solo.\nJust follow.\nHe was the first guy of any of them\n- that didnt look like he was struggling.\n- Thats what I told Bob.\nDo you know what I mean\nabout, like, it--?\nYou know, with some\nof the other guys,\nit was sort of percent\nover their capabilities,\nor something like that. You dont\nfeel that with this guy at all.\nIts like the last three songs,\nlike Sanitarium, Nothing Else\nMatters and what was...?\n- Sad But True.\n- Sad But True, they were flawless.\nI looked over at him\nduring Whiplash,\nand he was just right in the pocket\nand in there.\nAnd then afterwards, when he\nplayed it alone with his finger,\nit hadnt been played that way\nsince Cliff.\nIts just, like:\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, his fingers a pick, you know?\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, its three picks.\nAll right, are we\ngonna sack Bob now?\nWell, the second time\nyou came back,\nI mean, that was, for me,\nwhen I noticed\nthat you make us play better, man.\nYou make the band sound\nso much better.\n- So solid.\n- How do you feel about that, man?\nWell, I feel awesome, man.\n- Youre the chosen one.\n- You looked coolest.\nAnd we want you to be a real member\nof this band, not just a hired hand.\nAnd wed like to offer you--\nBasically, to give--\nTo show you how serious\nwe are about this,\noffer you a million dollars\nto join our band right now.\n- And--\n- Wait, okay.\nAnd as a kind of a good-faith thing\nabout how serious we are--\nIts an advance.\nIts an advance on some percentage\nyoure gonna be making\nwith the band.\nHeres money up front to get you\nkicked in and inspired and:\nThis is a reality. This is my future.\nThis is what life can hold for me\nwith my new family.\nI cant really talk right now.\nInvisible kid\nNever see what he did\nGot stuck where he hid\nFalling through the grid\nInvisible kid\nGot a place of his own\nWhere hell never be known\nInward hes grown\nInvisible kid\nNever see what he did\nGot stuck where he hid\nFalling through the grid\nInvisible kid\nGot a place of his own\nWhere hell never be known\nInward hes grown\nTheres things that I miss,\nand Im sad it couldnt work out,\nand things, you know, like that. But\ntheres way, way, way, way more times\nand way more days and even hours\nthat go by and Im reminded, Dude,\nall right.\nYou did the right thing.\nYou know, You did the right thing\nfor yourself.\nI dont know if its the right time\nto say this,\nbut, I dont know,\nIve been thinking about our talk.\nAbout, you know, you and us and\nour future and all of that stuff, and...\nAnd, you know, when I heard\nthat you guys were moving here\nand all of that, that brought up\na lot of fear around:\nWow, what is Phils perception of,\nyou know, his, you know, longevity\nwith Metallica? You know?\nThat scared me a little bit.\nWell, I appreciate that. I was--\nIf it scared you, and thats part\nof the issue going forward,\nthen let me say we havent decided\nwere moving here.\nIve tried to make it clear\nthat were selling--\nI think weve told people were selling\nour house in Kansas City,\nbut that doesnt mean\nwere moving here, okay?\nAnd we wont likely move\nto San Francisco\nif theres not a future out there\nwith Metallica,\nbecause, you know, thats my--\nI wanna make sure\nthat the bass players intact.\nI wanna be sure that the tours on.\nAnd I also, as I said,\nhave performance-coach visions\nfor each of you and for the band.\nAnd l-- To me, the work isnt over.\nId like us to honour what we had,\nand if you wanna be away from--\nYou know, on your own or something\nfor the couple of months\nuntil we come back in June,\nthats okay. I just kind of--\nI dont know. I guess I have a problem\nwith the, Lets see how it works out.\nLets see how it happens,\nand then, No, lets honour what\nhappened, you know, six months ago.\nYou know? Thats kind of strange\nto me, you know?\nBecause I think that you use\nthose things\nwhen theyre convenient at times,\nyou know?\nPersonal stuff or business things.\nAnd I dont know. I dont know.\nTheyre-- The boundaries are--\nI dont-- Becoming more clear to me.\nTheres that element of-- Of trust that\njust kind of floats with you with me.\nAnd l-- And that-- Im really sorry\nabout that. That-- You know.\nIve been swimming uphill on that one\nfor a long time with you,\nand Id like for us\nto be able to resolve it.\nBut maybe we cant.\nIve gotta tell you that l--\nYou know, if the client,\neither James or us, says:\nYou know, then I really think that\nneeds to be respected without,\nyou know, just, you know,\nthe old turn-the-knife thing in there.\nYou know, its just, you know,\nif the client says,\nyou know, timeout for a while,\ntimeout.\nThat is great, although we--\nOur process, what we normally do--\nThen it should be put on the table,\nbut left on the table,\nand should be able to walk away\nwithout what youre saying right now,\nwhich is now there are trust issues\nand stuff.\nI dont know how to separate out--\nIn its simplest form,\nI think its a conflict of interest\nthat you tell him that he needs\nyou around more.\n- If he has--\n- No, no, no, no, no.\nIm not saying that.\nI see that as a conflict of interest.\nLook, I am saying you guys\nhave made a decision.\nIts okay for me to say\nIm not happy with that decision.\nThe premise is,\nyou guys dont need me.\nAnd Im good with that.\nAnyway, you go... Its--\n- Anyway, lets jam.\n- Great, Ill see you guys.\nIm taking off. Ill see you\nnext week. Have a good one.\nThanks, man.\nWhos in charge of my head today?\nDancing devils in angels way\nIts my time now\nIts my time now\nIts my time now\nIts my time\nLook out, motherfuckers\nHere I come\nIm gonna make my head my home\nThe sons of bitches\nTry to take my head\nTried to make me\nSomeone else instead\nYouve been in the band for five\nminutes, and youre an icon?\nIts such an honour,\nand, you know, Im stoked. So...\nYour voting interest will equal\nyour percentage interest\nin a new account,\nwhile each of our voting interests\nwill be one-third of the difference\nbetween percent\nand your percentage.\nThis is about as lawyer as you get.\nBut its really--\n- Sort of laying out--\n- Yeah, lays out the deal.\nOkay, so, for instance, in the first\nperiod you have percent, okay?\nSo when we do a vote, you\nget votes, you get votes,\nyou get votes, you get five votes,\nin any vote, okay?\n- But this doesnt mean anything.\n- I think its crap. I mean, l--\nI think in the spirit\nof what were trying to do,\nwe better do and then\nQ Primes the tiebreaker. Thats--\nThat works, thats fine. Cool.\nNow, here it also says, You will not\nbe required to fund any losses\nin the new Metallica account,\nbut we will be entitled\nto recover any losses out\nof future profits.\nFor instance, buying the documentary,\nits not your problem.\nIf the documentary loses money\nand the company never makes\nany more money again,\nits these three guys problem.\nExactly.\nWhatd you do with your money?\nI went and bought a car,\nI bought my mom a house,\nand we went and bought\na documentary.\nIt was just-- You gotta keep\nin the spirit of this whole thing.\nBy the end of this week,\nwere gonna have an album title.\nBecause in three days, we wont\nhave to agonize about this anymore.\nWell, the thing that stood out to me\nwas St. Anger. Its strong.\nI mean, theres--\nIconic strong, you know?\n- I like that title quite a bit.\n- Its so easy\njust to say,\nJune th is St. Angers Day.\n- Yeah, well, its true. Thats cool.\n- No, I mean--\nI think Frantic is a better album title.\n- I think thats--\n- I dont know.\n- Its more about the record.\n- But St. Angers a good--\nIts an original statement.\nSt. Anger, St. Anger.\nWell, this is an angry record,\nbut you read the lyrics,\nits angry in a healthy way.\n- Its also frantic.\n- Getting stuff out.\nFrantic is more like,\nTheyre trying things that they dont--\nThey dont--\nTheyre not exactly sure of.\nThey dont know what theyre doing.\nTheyre trying to climb back up\nthe mountain again.\nTheyre not sure of themselves.\nI mean, hello, thats a fair thing.\nI mean, if you think that Frantic\nhas a negative connotation to it,\nI never thought of it like that.\nIf its St. Anger,\ntheyre gonna form an image of:\nThese guys are angry. I know it.\nTheyre angry about Napster.\nTheyre angry about the new stuff\nthats coming in.\nTheyre angry about their lives.\nIm angry too. I get it.\nI think you guys know the idea about\nshooting a video in San Quentin.\nSo let me get this straight.\nYoure gonna go to\na maximum-security prison,\nand Metallicas gonna play\nSt. Anger really loud.\n- Yeah!\n- Yeah!\nSt. Anger round my neck\nSt. Anger round my neck\nHe never gets respect\nSt. Anger round my neck\nIve been asked to come out here\nand talk a little bit\nabout what this song means to us.\nAngers an emotion that Ive struggled\nwith for pretty much all my life.\n- St. Anger round my neck\n- You flush it out, you flush it out\nHe never gets respect\nTheres a lot of misspent anger\nthat has come out sideways\nfor a lot of people.\nIncluding yourselves.\nAnd if I hadnt had music in my life,\nits quite possible I could be in here,\nor not even in here, be dead.\nAnd Id much rather be alive.\nMadly in anger with you\nIm madly in anger with you\nIm madly in anger with you\nIm madly in anger with you\nIm pretty nervous up here.\nI dont really know what to say.\nIm just trying to share\nsome of whats going on for me.\nIm not here to sell nothing,\nthats for damn sure.\nEveryone is born good.\nEveryones got the same size soul,\nand were here to connect with that.\nSo were very proud to be\nin your house\nand play some music for you.\nThanks.\nMore than any other record,\nI dont know if you feel that,\nbut for me, this is like product\nof what were just doing, hanging out.\nYou know what I mean?\n- Its almost like a diary.\n- Yeah.\nIts like, heres our memories on CD,\nyou know?\nIts like weve proven that\nyou can make aggressive music\n- without negative energy.\n- Yeah.\nOkay, and I dont think anybody ever\nthought that that would be possible.\nYou know? You can make\nsomething thats aggressive\nand fucked up, okay?\nWith positive energy\n- between the people creating it.\n- Yeah.\nIt hit me, you know? This projects\ncoming to an end, and I dont know,\nI think Im kind of bummed\nabout that.\nIm kind of, just, kind of liking\nthe schedule that happens,\nor the safeness in that.\nComing here, being able to talk.\nCreating, you know?\nAnd... I dont know.\nIve been kind of coming down\nfrom this for about the past month.\nI mean, getting up at in the morning,\nand just pacing my apartment.\nJust not really knowing\nwhat the hell Im doing either.\nSo Im with you.\nLike, I dont wanna let you go home.\nI dont know.\nI really appreciate that.\nThats really nice of you to say.\nI dont know, I can feel myself\nkind of protecting myself\nwith some depression or something,\nwanting to just kind of isolate.\nAnd I dont wanna do that.\nI wanna feel the sadness of--\nI mean, I didnt feel depressed,\nI felt sad.\nAnd thats when I knew it was\nsomething different than just me...\nMy old stuff, you know?\nI mean, there is some of that, but...\nSadness and depression, I guess\nI dont really know the difference.\nAnd, Phil, all the stuff\nthat youve brought here to, like...\nYouve set out all the tools,\nlike, you know?\nAnd you allowed us to build\nwhat weve built, you know?\nWith guidance.\nI really appreciate your bringing\nthis forward.\nAnd there is a difference between\nsadness and depression.\nClearly.\nThis is the hugest chapter in my life.\nIf I could have my wasted days back\nWould I use them to get\nBack on track?\nStand back.
