John Lennon was a rubbish musician. He took an interest in performing music during the skiffle craze of the late fifties, and the ragtag, untidy style was a perfect fit for the young Lennon. Unlike McCartney, he was devoid of almost any formal musical tuition, his famously stern Aunt Mimi preferring him to paint rather than to strum. When he began playing the guitar, his understanding of what he was actually doing was so low that he didnt even know his instrument had two strings missing until George Harrison pointed it out to him. After the passage of Beatlemania his understanding of how to use his talents was occasionally bolstered but as a teenager he was very much a lone force.\nWhat he did possess was confidence, reams and reams of the stuff. This is what made him such a potent performer and drove him to better himself after meeting his opposite, the precise, natural musician that was Paul McCartney. In their early work, it is often said that Paul sung the love songs and that John sung the screamers. Whilst this is not entirely true , the lions share of attention was on John in the early days. His stage presence spills over into his 1958-64 songwriting, full of loud guitar, empassioned delivery, and cocksure lyrics .\nLennons early work is full of bluesy sevenths, augmented chord changes and sudden shifts in musical direction. The majority of his earlier songs fit into one of three categories: straightforward blues , thoughtful folk or bitter, dissonant pop . With eyesight so bad he could barely see what fret he was playing on, Lennon didnt write the next chord by following typical progressions, but rather by prodding around the fretboard until he found something that fitted. This created songs with unusual, ambiguous sounds in his early work such as Ill Be Back, and later on in his career gave him such moments as the F9 in the verse of Julia .\nUnlike McCartney, Lennon had an unsubtle singing voice and a comparatively small range. This meant his melodies lacked the scalar jumps of his partners and instead carried a cynical, narrow sound that can be heard in many of their joint lead vocal songs . The most defining feature of Lennons melodies is that they were often made up of one note repeated many times , or of a few of notes alternated between in quick succession .\nLater in The Beatles career, Lennons increasing drug use and relationship with Yoko Ono changed him on every level. Fiercely rejecting his youthful arrogance , he disowned every facet of his previous existence, including his estranged wife and son, Julian. Still capable of writing rock songs but largely disinterested with conventional music, he began to explore new methods of innovation, learning a fingerpicking style in India that facilitated his newfound introspection .\nBy the time The Beatles came to record Abbey Road, Lennon was spiritually no longer part of The Beatles. McCartneys magnum opus, the side two medley, was dismissed by Lennon as rubbish, who claimed that Come Together and Something were the only good songs on the album. Though his solo output showed some of his potential, his stint as a househusband was the death of his musical heyday. The two songs he wrote that were used for The Beatles Anthology, Free As A Bird and Real Love, are both musically lazy and uncharacteristically conventional. It is rude to both start and end this piece with an insult, however, so it must be said that John Lennons style is almost impossible to replicate. Both simple and unique, it was a by-product of his own personality and as such, died with him.", "Like a rolling stone\nLike a rolling stone\nLike a rolling stone\nLike the FBI\nAnd the CIA\nAnd the BBC\nB.B.

since 1975, when they vanished from public view. Lets start with you, John. What have you been doing?\nLENNON: Ive been baking bread and looking after the baby.\nPLAYBOY: With what secret projects going on in the basement?\nLENNON: Thats like what everyone else who has asked me that question over the last few years says. But what else have you been doing? To which I say, Are you kidding? Because bread and babies, as every housewife knows, is a full-time job. After I made the loaves, I felt like I had conquered something. But as I watched the bread being eaten, I thought, Well, Jesus, dont I get a gold record or knighted or nothing?\nPLAYBOY: Why did you become a househusband?\nLENNON: There were many reasons. I had been under obligation or contract from the time I was 22 until well into my 30s. After all those years, it was all I knew. I wasnt free. I was boxed in. My contract was the physical manifestation of being in prison. It was more important to face myself and face that reality than to continue a life of rock n roll... and to go up and down with the whims of either your own performance or the publics opinion of you. Rock n roll was not fun anymore. I chose not to take the standard options in my business... going to Vegas and singing your great hits, if youre lucky, or going to hell, which is where Elvis went.\nONO: John was like an artist who is very good at drawing circles. He sticks to that and it becomes his label. He has a gallery to promote that. And the next year, he will do triangles or something. It doesnt reflect his life at all. When you continue doing the same thing for ten years, you get a prize for having done it.\nLENNON: You get the big prize when you get cancer and you have been drawing circles and triangles for ten years. I had become a craftsman and I could have continued being a craftsman. I respect craftsmen, but I am not interested in becoming one.\nONO: Just to prove that you can go on dishing out things.\nPLAYBOY: Youre talking about records, of course.\nLENNON: Yeah, to churn them out because I was expected to, like so many people who put out an album every six months because theyre supposed to.\nPLAYBOY: Would you be referring to Paul McCartney?\nLENNON: Not only Paul. But I had lost the initial freedom of the artist by becoming enslaved to the image of what the artist is supposed to do. A lot of artists kill themselves because of it, whether it is through drink, like Dylan Thomas, or through insanity, like Van Gogh, or through V.D., like Gauguin.\nPLAYBOY: Most people would have continued to churn out the product. How were you able to see a way out?\nLENNON: Most people dont live with Yoko Ono.\nPLAYBOY: Which means?\nLENNON: Most people dont have a companion who will tell the truth and refuse to live with a bullshit artist, which I am pretty good at. I can bullshit myself and everybody around. Yoko: Thats my answer.\nPLAYBOY: What did she do for you?\nLENNON: She showed me the possibility of the alternative. You dont have to do this. I dont? Really? But-but-but-but-but... Of course, it wasnt that simple and it didnt sink in overnight. It took constant reinforcement. Walking away is much harder than carrying on. Ive done both. On demand and on schedule, I had turned out records from 1962 to 1975. Walking away seemed like what the guys go through at 65, when suddenly theyre supposed to not exist anymore and theyre sent out of the office... Your life is over. Time for golf.\nPLAYBOY: Yoko, how did you feel about Johns becoming a househusband?\nONO: When John and I would go out, people would come up and say, John, what are you doing? but they never asked about me, because, as a woman, I wasnt supposed to be doing anything.\nLENNON: When I was cleaning the cat shit and feeding Sean, she was sitting in rooms full of smoke with men in three-piece suits that they couldnt button.\nONO: I handled the business: old business... Apple, Maclen, and new investments.\nLENNON: We had to face the business. It was either another case of asking some daddy to come solve our business or having one of us do it. Those lawyers were getting a quarter of a million dollars a year to sit around a table and eat salmon at the Plaza. Most of them didnt seem interested in solving the problems. Every lawyer had a lawyer. Each Beatle had four or five people working. So we felt we had to look after that side of the business and get rid of it and deal with it before we could start dealing with our own life. And the only one of us who has the talent or the ability to deal with it on that level is Yoko.\nPLAYBOY: Did you have experience handling business matters of that proportion?\nONO: I learned. The law is not a mystery to me anymore. Politicians are not a mystery to me. Im not scared of all that establishment anymore. At first, my own accountant and my own lawyer could not deal with the fact that I was telling them what to do.\nLENNON: There was a bit of an attitude that this is Johns wife, but surely she cant really be representing him.\nONO: A lawyer would send a letter to the directors, but instead of sending it to me, he would send it to John or send it to my lawyer. Youd be surprised how much insult I took from them initially. There was all this But you dont know anything about law; I cant talk to you. I said, All right, talk to me in the way I can understand it. I am a director, too.\nLENNON: They cant stand it. But they have to stand it, because she is who represents us. Theyre all male, you know, just big and fat, vodka lunch, shouting males, like trained dogs, trained to attack all the time. Recently, she made it possible for us to earn a large sum of money that benefited all of them and they fought and fought not to let her do it, because it was her idea and she was a woman and she was not a professional. But she did it, and then one of the guys said to her, Well, Lennon does it again. But Lennon didnt have anything to do with it.\nPLAYBOY: Why are you returning to the studio and public life?\nLENNON: You breathe in and you breathe out. We feel like doing it and we have something to say. Also, Yoko and I attempted a few times to make music together, but that was a long time ago and people still had the idea that the Beatles were some kind of sacred thing that shouldnt step outside its circle. It was hard for us to work together then. We think either people have forgotten or they have grown up by now, so we can make a second foray into that place where she and I are together, making music... simply that. Its not like Im some wondrous, mystic prince from the rock-n-roll world dabbling in strange music with this exotic, Oriental dragon lady, which was the picture projected by the press before.\nPLAYBOY: Some people have accused you of playing to the media. First you become a recluse, then you talk selectively to the press because you have a new album coming out.\nLENNON: Thats ridiculous. People always said John and Yoko would do anything for the publicity. In the Newsweek article, it says the reporter asked us, Why did you go underground? Well, she never asked it that way and I didnt go underground. I just stopped talking to the press. It got to be pretty funny. I was calling myself Greta Hughes or Howard Garbo through that period. But still the gossip items never stopped. We never stopped being in the press, but there seemed to be more written about us when we werent talking to the press than when we were.\nPLAYBOY: How do you feel about all the negative press thats been directed through the years at Yoko, your dragon lady, as you put it?\nLENNON: We are both sensitive people and we were hurt a lot by it. I mean, we couldnt understand it. When youre in love, when somebody says something like, How can you be with that woman? you say, What do you mean? I am with this goddess of love, the fulfillment of my whole life. Why are you saying this? Why do you want to throw a rock at her or punish me for being in love with her? Our love helped us survive it, but some of it was pretty violent. There were a few times when we nearly went under, but we managed to survive and here we are. Thank you, thank you, thank you.\nPLAYBOY: But what about the charge that John Lennon is under Yokos spell, under her control?\nLENNON: Well, thats rubbish, you know. Nobody controls me. Im uncontrollable. The only one who controls me is me, and thats just barely possible.\nPLAYBOY: Still, many people believe it.\nLENNON: Listen, if somebodys gonna impress me, whether it be a Maharishi or a Yoko Ono, there comes a point when the emperor has no clothes. There comes a point when I will see. So for all you folks out there who think that Im having the wool pulled over my eyes, well, thats an insult to me. Not that you think less of Yoko, because thats your problem. What I think of her is what counts! Because... fuck you, brother and sister... you dont know whats happening. Im not here for you. Im here for me and her and the baby!\nONO: Of course, its a total insult to me...\nLENNON: Well, youre always insulted, my dear wife. Its natural...\nONO: Why should I bother to control anybody?\nLENNON: She doesnt need me.\nONO: I have my own life, you know.\nLENNON: She doesnt need a Beatle. Who needs a Beatle?\nONO: Do people think Im that much of a con? John lasted two months with the Maharishi. Two months. I must be the biggest con in the world, because Ive been with him 13 years.\nLENNON: But people do say that.\nPLAYBOY: Thats our point. Why?\nLENNON: They want to hold on to something they never had in the first place. Anybody who claims to have some interest in me as an individual artist or even as part of the Beatles has absolutely misunderstood everything I ever said if they cant see why Im with Yoko. And if they cant see that, they dont see anything. Theyre just jacking off to... it could be anybody. Mick Jagger or somebody else. Let them go jack off to Mick Jagger, OK? I dont need it.\nPLAYBOY: Hell appreciate that.\nLENNON: I absolutely dont need it. Let them chase Wings. Just forget about me. If thats what you want, go after Paul or Mick. I aint here for that. If thats not apparent in my past, Im saying it in black and green, next to all the tits and asses on page 196. Go play with the other boys. Dont bother me. Go play with the Rolling Wings.\nPLAYBOY: Do you...\nLENNON: No, wait a minute. Lets stay with this a second; sometimes I cant let go of it. Nobody ever said anything about Pauls having a spell on me or my having one on Paul! They never thought that was abnormal in those days, two guys together, or four guys together! Why didnt they ever say, How come those guys dont split up? I mean, whats going on backstage? What is this Paul and John business? How can they be together so long? We spent more time together in the early days than John and Yoko: the four of us sleeping in the same room, practically in the same bed, in the same truck, living together night and day, eating, shitting and pissing together! All right? Doing everything together! Nobody said a damn thing about being under a spell. Maybe they said we were under the spell of Brian Epstein or George Martin. Theres always somebody who has to be doing something to you. You know, theyre congratulating the Stones on being together 112 years. Whoooopee! At least Charlie and Bill still got their families. In the Eighties, theyll be asking, Why are those guys still together? Cant they hack it on their own? Why do they have to be surrounded by a gang? Is the little leader scared somebodys gonna knife him in the back? Thats gonna be the question. Thats-a-gonna be the question! Theyre gonna look back at the Beatles and the Stones and all those guys as relics. The days when those bands were just all men will be on the newsreels, you know. They will be showing pictures of the guy with lipstick wriggling his ass and the four guys with the evil black make-up on their eyes trying to look raunchy. Thats gonna be the joke in the future, not a couple singing together or living and working together. Its all right when youre 16, 17, 18 to have male companions and idols, OK? Its tribal and its gang and its fine. But when it continues and youre still doing it when youre 40, that means youre still 16 in the head.\nPLAYBOY: Lets start at the beginning. Tell us the story of how the wondrous mystic prince and the exotic Oriental dragon lady met.\nLENNON: It was in 1966 in England. Id been told about this event... this Japanese avant-garde artist coming from America. I was looking around the gallery and I saw this ladder and climbed up and got a look in this spyglass on the top of the ladder... you feel like a fool... and it just said, Yes. Now, at the time, all the avant-garde was smash the piano with a hammer and break the sculpture and anti-, anti-, anti-, anti-, anti. It was all boring negative crap, you know. And just that Yes made me stay in a gallery full of apples and nails. There was a sign that said, Hammer A Nail In, so I said, Can I hammer a nail in? But Yoko said no, because the show wasnt opening until the next day. But the owner came up and whispered to her, Let him hammer a nail in. You know, hes a millionaire. He might buy it. And so there was this little conference, and finally she said, OK, you can hammer a nail in for five shillings. So smartass says, Well, Ill give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in. And thats when we really met. Thats when we locked eyes and she got it and I got it and, as they say in all the interviews we do, the rest is history.\nPLAYBOY: What happened next?\nLENNON: Of course, I was a Beatle, but things had begun to change. In 1966, just before we met, I went to Almeria, Spain, to make the movie How I Won the War. It did me a lot of good to get away. I was there six weeks. I wrote Strawberry Fields Forever there, by the way. It gave me time to think on my own, away from the others. From then on, I was looking for somewhere to go, but I didnt have the nerve to really step out on the boat by myself and push it off. But when I fell in love with Yoko, I knew, My God, this is different from anything Ive ever known. This is something other. This is more than a hit record, more than gold, more than everything. It is indescribable.\nPLAYBOY: Were falling in love with Yoko and wanting to leave the Beatles connected?\nLENNON: As I said, I had already begun to want to leave, but when I met Yoko is like when you meet your first woman. You leave the guys at the bar. You dont go play football anymore. You dont go play snooker or billiards. Maybe some guys do it on Friday night or something, but once I found the woman, the boys became of no interest whatsoever other than being old school friends. Those wedding bells are breaking up that old gang of mine. We got married three years later, in 1969. That was the end of the boys. And it just so happened that the boys were well known and werent just local guys at the bar. Everybody got so upset over it. There was a lot of shit thrown at us. A lot of hateful stuff.\nONO: Even now, I just read that Paul said, I understand that he wants to be with her, but why does he have to be with her all the time?\nLENNON: Yoko, do you still have to carry that cross? That was years ago.\nONO: No, no, no. He said it recently. I mean, what happened with John is like, I sort of went to bed with this guy that I liked and suddenly the next morning, I see these three in-laws, standing there.\nLENNON: Ive always thought there was this underlying thing in Pauls Get Back. When we were in the studio recording it, every time he sang the line Get back to where you once belonged, hed look at Yoko.\nPLAYBOY: Are you kidding?\nLENNON: No. But maybe hell say Im paranoid.\nPLAYBOY: This may be the time to talk about those in-laws, as Yoko put it. John, youve been asked this a thousand times, but why is it so unthinkable that the Beatles might get back together to make some music?\nLENNON: Do you want to go back to high school? Why should I go back ten years to provide an illusion for you that I know does not exist? It cannot exist.\nPLAYBOY: Then forget the illusion. What about just to make some great music again? Do you acknowledge that the Beatles made great music?\nLENNON: Why should the Beatles give more? Didnt they give everything on Gods earth for ten years? Didnt they give themselves? Youre like the typical sort of love-hate fan who says, Thank you for everything you did for us in the Sixties... would you just give me another shot? Just one more miracle?\nPLAYBOY: Were not talking about miracles... just good music.\nLENNON: When Rodgers worked with Hart and then worked with Hammerstein, do you think he should have stayed with one instead of working with the other? Should Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis have stayed together because I used to like them together? What is this game of doing things because other people want it? The whole Beatle idea was to do what you want, right? To take your own responsibility.\nPLAYBOY: Alright, but get back to the music itself. You dont agree that the Beatles created the best rock n roll thats been produced?\nLENNON: I dont. The Beatles, you see... Im too involved in them artistically. I cannot see them objectively. I cannot listen to them objectively. Im dissatisfied with every record the Beatles ever fucking made. There aint one of them I wouldnt remake... including all the Beatles records and all my individual ones. So I cannot possibly give you an assessment of what the Beatles are. When I was a Beatle, I thought we were the best fucking group in the god-damned world. And believing that is what made us what we were... whether we call it the best rock n roll group or the best pop group or whatever. But you play me those tracks today and I want to remake every damn one of them. Theres not a single one... I heard Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds on the radio last night. Its abysmal, you know. The track is just terrible. I mean, its great, but it wasnt made right, know what I mean? But thats the artistic trip, isnt it? Thats why you keep going. But to get back to your original question about the Beatles and their music, the answer is that we did some good stuff and we did some bad stuff.\nPLAYBOY: Many people feel that none of the songs Paul has done alone match the songs he did as a Beatle. Do you honestly feel that any of your songs on the Plastic Ono Band records will have the lasting imprint of Eleanor Rigby or Strawberry Fields?\nLENNON: Imagine, Love and those Plastic Ono Band songs stand up to any song that was written when I was a Beatle. Now, it may take you 20 or 30 years to appreciate that, but the fact is, if you check those songs out, you will see that it is as good as any fucking stuff that was ever done.\nPLAYBOY: It seems as if youre trying to say to the world, We were just a good band making some good music, while a lot of the rest of the world is saying, It wasnt just some good music, it was the best.\nLENNON: Well, if it was the best, so what?\nPLAYBOY: So...\nLENNON: It can never be again! Everyone always talks about a good thing coming to an end, as if life was over. But Ill be 40 when this interview comes out. Paul is 38. Elton John, Bob Dylan... were all relatively young people. The game isnt over yet. Everyone talks in terms of the last record or the last Beatle concert... but, God willing, there are another 40 years of productivity to go. Im not judging whether I am the Walrus is better or worse than Imagine. It is for others to judge. I am doing it. I do. I dont stand back and judge... I do.\nPLAYBOY: You keep saying you dont want to go back ten years, that too much has changed. Dont you ever feel it would be interesting... never mind cosmic, just interesting... to get together, with all your new experiences, and cross your talents?\nLENNON: Wouldnt it be interesting to take Elvis back to his Sun Records period? I dont know. But Im content to listen to his Sun Records. I dont want to dig him up out of the grave. The Beatles dont exist and can never exist again. John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Richard Starkey could put on a concert... but it can never be the Beatles singing Strawberry Fields or I Am The Walrus again, because we are not in our 20s. We cannot be that again, nor can the people who are listening.\nPLAYBOY: But arent you the one who is making it too important? What if it were just nostalgic fun? A high school reunion?\nLENNON: I never went to high school reunions. My thing is, Out of sight, out of mind. Thats my attitude toward life. So I dont have any romanticism about any part of my past. I think of it only inasmuch as it gave me pleasure or helped me grow psychologically. That is the only thing that interests me about yesterday. I dont believe in yesterday, by the way. You know I dont believe in yesterday. I am only interested in what I am doing now.\nPLAYBOY: What about the people of your generation, the ones who feel a certain kind of music and spirit died when the Beatles broke up?\nLENNON: If they didnt understand the Beatles and the Sixties then, what the fuck could we do for them now? Do we have to divide the fish and the loaves for the multitudes again? Do we have to get crucified again? Do we have to do the walking on water again because a whole pile of dummies didnt see it the first time, or didnt believe it when they saw it? You know, thats what theyre asking: Get off the cross. I didnt understand the first bit yet. Can you do that again? No way. You can never go home. It doesnt exist.\nPLAYBOY: Do you find that the clamor for a Beatles reunion has died down?\nLENNON: Well, I heard some Beatles stuff on the radio the other day and I heard Green Onion ...no, Glass Onion, I dont even know my own songs! I listened to it because it was a rare track...\nPLAYBOY: That was the one that contributed to the Paul McCartney is dead uproar because of the lyric The walrus is Paul.\nLENNON: Yeah. That line was a joke, you know. That line was put in partly because I was feeling guilty because I was with Yoko, and I knew I was finally high and dry. In a perverse way, I was sort of saying to Paul, Here, have this crumb, have this illusion, have this stroke... because Im leaving you. Anyway, its a song they dont usually play. When a radio station has a Beatles weekend, they usually play the same ten songs... A Hard Days Night, Help!, Yesterday, Something, Let It Be ...you know, theres all that wealth of material, but we hear only ten songs. So the deejaysays, I want to thank John, Paul, George and Ringo for not getting back together and spoiling a good thing. I thought it was a good sign. Maybe people are catching on.\nPLAYBOY: Aside from the millions youve been offered for a reunion concert, how did you feel about producer Lorne Michaels generous offer of $3200 for appearing together on Saturday Night Live a few years ago?\nLENNON: Oh, yeah. Paul and I were together watching that show. He was visiting us at our place in the Dakota. We were watching it and almost went down to the studio, just as a gag. We nearly got into a cab, but we were actually too tired.\nPLAYBOY: How did you and Paul happen to be watching TV together?\nLENNON: That was a period when Paul just kept turning up at our door with a guitar. I would let him in, but finally I said to him, Please call before you come over. Its not 1956 and turning up at the door isnt the same anymore. You know, just give me a ring. He was upset by that, but I didnt mean it badly. I just meant that I was taking care of a baby all day and some guy turns up at the door... But, anyway, back on that night, he and Linda walked in and he and I were just sitting there, watching the show, and we went, Ha-ha, wouldnt it be funny if we went down? but we didnt.\nPLAYBOY: Was that the last time you saw Paul?\nLENNON: Yes, but I didnt mean it like that.\nPLAYBOY: Were asking because theres always a lot of speculation about whether the Fab Four are dreaded enemies or the best of friends.\nLENNON: Were neither. I havent seen any of the Beatles for I dont know how much time. Somebody asked me what I thought of Pauls last album and I made some remark like, I thought he was depressed and sad. But then I realized I hadnt listened to the whole damn thing. I heard one track... the hit Coming Up, which I thought was a good piece of work. Then I heard something else that sounded like he was depressed. But I dont follow their work. I dont follow Wings, you know. I dont give a shit what Wings is doing, or what Georges new album is doing, or what Ringo is doing. Im not interested, no more than I am in what Elton John or Bob Dylan is doing. Its not callousness, its just that Im too busy living my own life to be following what other people are doing, whether theyre the Beatles or guys I went to college with or people I had intense relationships with before I met the Beatles.\nPLAYBOY: Besides Coming Up, what do you think of Pauls work since he left the Beatles?\nLENNON: I kind of admire the way Paul started back from scratch, forming a new band and playing in small dance halls, because thats what he wanted to do with the Beatles... he wanted us to go back to the dance halls and experience that again. But I didnt. That was one of the problems, in a way, that he wanted to relive it all or something... I dont know what it was. But I kind of admire the way he got off his pedestal. Now hes back on it again, but I mean, he did what he wanted to do. Thats fine, but its just not what I wanted to do.\nPLAYBOY: What about the music?\nLENNON: The Long and Winding Road was the last gasp from him. Although I really havent listened.\nPLAYBOY: You say you havent listened to Pauls work and havent really talked to him since that night in your apartment...\nLENNON: Really talked to him, no, thats the operative word. I havent really talked to him in ten years. Because I havent spent time with him. Ive been doing other things and so has he. You know, hes got 25 kids and about 20,000,000 records out. How can he spend time talking? Hes always working.\nPLAYBOY: Then lets talk about the work you did together. Generally speaking, what did each of you contribute to the Lennon-McCartney songwriting team?\nLENNON: Well, you could say that he provided a lightness, an optimism, while I would always go for the sadness, the discords, a certain bluesy edge. There was a period when I thought I didnt write melodies, that Paul wrote those and I just wrote straight, shouting rock n roll. But, of course, when I think of some of my own songs... In My Life or some of the early stuff... This Boy. I was writing melody with the best of them. Paul had a lot of training, could play a lot of instruments. Hed say, Well, why dont you change that there? Youve done that note 50 times in the song. You know, Ill grab a note and ram it home. Then again, Id be the one to figure out where to go with a song... a story that Paul would start. In a lot of the songs, my stuff is the middle-eight, the bridge.\nPLAYBOY: For example?\nLENNON: Take Michelle. Paul and I were staying somewhere, and he walked in and hummed the first few bars, with the words, you know-- and he says, Where do I go from here? Id been listening to blues singer Nina Simone, who did something like I love you! in one of her songs and that made me think of the middle-eight for Michelle. I love you, I love you, I lo-ove you...\nPLAYBOY: What was the difference in terms of lyrics?\nLENNON: I always had an easier time with lyrics, though Paul is quite a capable lyricist who doesnt think he is. So he doesnt go for it. Rather than face the problem, he would avoid it. Hey Jude is a damn good set of lyrics. I made no contribution to the lyrics there. And a couple of lines he has come up with show indications of a good lyricist. But he just hasnt taken it anywhere. Still, in the early days, we didnt care about lyrics as long as the song had some vague theme... she loves you, he loves him, they all love each other. It was the hook, line and sound we were going for. Thats still my attitude, but I cant leave lyrics alone. I have to make them make sense apart from the songs.\nPLAYBOY: Whats an example of a lyric you and Paul worked on together?\nLENNON: In We Can Work It Out, Paul did the first half, I did the middle-eight. But youve got Paul writing, We can work it out/We can work it out --real optimistic, y know, and me, impatient: Life is very short and theres no time/For fussing and fighting, my friend....\nPLAYBOY: Paul tells the story and John philosophizes.\nLENNON: Sure. Well, I was always like that, you know. I was like that before the Beatles and after the Beatles. I always asked why people did things and why society was like it was. I didnt just accept it for what it was apparently doing. I always looked below the surface.\nPLAYBOY: When you talk about working together on a single lyric like We Can Work It Out, it suggests that you and Paul worked a lot more closely than youve admitted in the past. Havent you said that you wrote most of your songs separately, despite putting both of your names on them?\nLENNON: Yeah, I was lying. It was when I felt resentful, so I felt that we did everything apart. But, actually, a lot of the songs we did eyeball to eyeball.\nPLAYBOY: But many of them were done apart, werent they?\nLENNON: Yeah. Sgt. Pepper was Pauls idea, and I remember he worked on it a lot and suddenly called me to go into the studio, said it was time to write some songs. On Pepper, under the pressure of only ten days, I managed to come up with Lucy in the Sky and Day in the Life. We werent communicating enough, you see. And later on, thats why I got resentful about all that stuff. But now I understand that it was just the same competitive game going on.\nPLAYBOY: But the competitive game was good for you, wasnt it?\nLENNON: In the early days. Wed make a record in 12 hours or something; they would want a single every three months and wed have to write it in a hotel room or in a van. So the cooperation was functional as well as musical.\nPLAYBOY: Dont you think that cooperation, that magic between you, is something youve missed in your work since?\nLENNON: I never actually felt a loss. I dont want it to sound negative, like I didnt need Paul, because when he was there, obviously, it worked. But I cant... its easier to say what I gave to him than what he gave to me. And hed say the same.\nPLAYBOY: Just a quick aside, but while were on the subject of lyrics and your resentment of Paul, what made you write How Do You Sleep?, which contains lyrics such as Those freaks was right when they said you was dead and The only thing you done was Yesterday/And since youve gone, youre just Another Day?\nLENNON: You know, I wasnt really feeling that vicious at the time. But I was using my resentment toward Paul to create a song, lets put it that way. He saw that it pointedly refers to him, and people kept hounding him about it. But, you know, there were a few digs on his album before mine. Hes so obscure other people didnt notice them, but I heard them. I thought, Well, Im not obscure, I just get right down to the nitty-gritty. So hed done it his way and I did it mine. But as to the line you quoted, yeah, I think Paul died creatively, in a way.\nPLAYBOY: Thats what we were getting at: You say that what youve done since the Beatles stands up well, but isnt it possible that with all of you, its been a case of the creative whole being greater than the parts?\nLENNON: I dont know whether this will gel for you: When the Beatles played in America for the first time, they played pure craftsmanship. Meaning they were already old hands. The jism had gone out of the performances a long time ago. In the same respect, the songwriting creativity had left Paul and me in the mid-Sixties. When we wrote together in the early days, it was like the beginning of a relationship. Lots of energy. In the Sgt. Pepper- Abbey Road period, the relationship had matured. Maybe had we gone on together, more interesting things would have come, but it couldnt have been the same.\nPLAYBOY: Lets move on to Ringo. Whats your opinion of him musically?\nLENNON: Ringo was a star in his own right in Liverpool before we even met. He was a professional drummer who sang and performed and had Ringo Starr-time and he was in one of the top groups in Britain but especially in Liverpool before we even had a drummer. So Ringos talent would have come out one way or the other as something or other. I dont know what he would have ended up as, but whatever that spark is in Ringo that we all know but cant put our finger on... whether it is acting, drumming or singing I dont know... there is something in him that is projectable and he would have surfaced with or without the Beatles. Ringo is a damn good drummer. He is not technically good, but I think Ringos drumming is underrated the same way Pauls bass playing is underrated. Paul was one of the most innovative bass players ever. And half the stuff that is going on now is directly ripped off from his Beatles period. He is an egomaniac about everything else about himself, but his bass playing he was always a bit coy about. I think Paul and Ringo stand up with any of the rock musicians. Not technically great... none of us are technical musicians. None of us could read music. None of us can write it. But as pure musicians, as inspired humans to make the noise, they are as good as anybody.\nPLAYBOY: How about Georges solo music?\nLENNON: I think All Things Must Pass was all right. It just went on too long.\nPLAYBOY: How did you feel about the lawsuit George lost that claimed the music to My Sweet Lord is a rip-off of the Shirelles hit Hes So Fine?\nLENNON: Well, he walked right into it. He knew what he was doing.\nPLAYBOY: Are you saying he consciously plagiarized the song?\nLENNON: He must have known, you know. Hes smarter than that. Its irrelevant, actually... only on a monetary level does it matter. He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have touched him, but he just let it go and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off.\nPLAYBOY: You actually havent mentioned George much in this interview.\nLENNON: Well, I was hurt by Georges book, I, Me, Mine ...so this message will go to him. He put a book out privately on his life that, by glaring omission, says that my influence on his life is absolutely zilch and nil. In his book, which is purportedly this clarity of vision of his influence on each song he wrote, he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. Im not in the book.\nPLAYBOY: Why?\nLENNON: Because Georges relationship with me was one of young follower and older guy. Hes three or four years younger than me. Its a love/hate relationship and I think George still bears resentment toward me for being a daddy who left home. He would not agree with this, but thats my feeling about it. I was just hurt. I was just left out, as if I didnt exist. I dont want to be that egomaniacal, but he was like a disciple of mine when we started. I was already an art student when Paul and George were still in grammar school. There is a vast difference between being in high school and being in college and I was already in college and already had sexual relationships, already drank and did a lot of things like that. When George was a kid, he used to follow me and my first girlfriend, Cynthia.. who became my wife... around. Wed come out of art school and hed be hovering around like those kids at the gate of the Dakota now. I remember the day he called to ask for help on Taxman, one of his bigger songs. I threw in a few one-liners to help the song along, because thats what he asked for. He came to me because he couldnt go to Paul, because Paul wouldnt have helped him at that period. I didnt want to do it. I thought, Oh, no, dont tell me I have to work on Georges stuff. Its enough doing my own and Pauls. But because I loved him and I didnt want to hurt him when he called me that afternoon and said, Will you help me with this song? I just sort of bit my tongue and said OK. It had been John and Paul so long, hed been left out because he hadnt been a songwriter up until then. As a singer, we allowed him only one track on each album. If you listen to the Beatles first albums, the English versions, he gets a single track. The songs he and Ringo sang at first were the songs that used to be part of my repertoire in the dance halls. I used to pick songs for them from my repertoire... the easier ones to sing. So I am slightly resentful of Georges book. But dont get me wrong. I still love those guys. The Beatles are over, but John, Paul, George and Ringo go on.\nPLAYBOY: Didnt all four Beatles work on a song you wrote for Ringo in 1973?\nLENNON: Im the Greatest. It was the Muhammad Ali line, of course. It was perfect for Ringo to sing. If I said, Im the greatest, theyd all take it so seriously. No one would get upset with Ringo singing it.\nPLAYBOY: Did you enjoy playing with George and Ringo again?\nLENNON: Yeah, except when George and Billy Preston started saying, Lets form a group. Lets form a group. I was embarrassed when George kept asking me. He was just enjoying the session and the spirit was very good, but I was with Yoko, you know. We took time out from what we were doing. The very fact that they would imagine I would form a male group without Yoko! It was still in their minds...\nPLAYBOY: Just to finish your favorite subject, what about the suggestion that the four of you put aside your personal feelings and regroup to give a mammoth concert for charity, some sort of giant benefit?\nLENNON: I dont want to have anything to do with benefits. I have been benefited to death.\nPLAYBOY: Why?\nLENNON: Because theyre always rip-offs. I havent performed for personal gain since 1966, when the Beatles last performed. Every concert since then, Yoko and I did for specific charities, except for a Toronto thing that was a rock n roll revival. Every one of them was a mess or a rip-off. So now we give money to who we want. Youve heard of tithing?\nPLAYBOY: Thats when you give away a fixed percentage of your income.\nLENNON: Right. I am just going to do it privately. I am not going to get locked into that business of saving the world on stage. The show is always a mess and the artist always comes off badly.\nPLAYBOY: What about the Bangladesh concert, in which George and other people such as Dylan performed?\nLENNON: Bangladesh was ca-ca.\nPLAYBOY: You mean because of all the questions that were raised about where the money went?\nLENNON: Yeah, right. I cant even talk about it, because its still a problem. Youll have to check with Mother because she knows the ins and outs of it, I dont. But its all a rip-off. So forget about it. All of you who are reading this, dont bother sending me all that garbage about, Just come and save the Indians, come and save the blacks, come and save the war veterans, Anybody I want to save will be helped through our tithing, which is ten percent of whatever we earn.\nPLAYBOY: But that doesnt compare with what one promoter, Sid Bernstein, said you could raise by giving a world-wide televised concert... playing separately, as individuals, or together, as the Beatles. He estimated you could raise over $200,000,000 in one day.\nLENNON: That was a commercial for Sid Bernstein written with Jewish schmaltz and showbiz and tears, dropping on one knee. It was Al Jolson. OK. So I dont buy that. OK?\nPLAYBOY: But the fact is, $200,000,000 to a poverty-stricken country in South America...\nLENNON: Where do people get off saying the Beatles should give $200,000,000 to South America? You know, America has poured billions into places like that. It doesnt mean a damn thing. After theyve eaten that meal, then what? It lasts for only a day. After the $200,000,000 is gone, then what? It goes round and round in circles. You can pour money in forever. After Peru, then Harlem, then Britain. There is no one concert. We would have to dedicate the rest of our lives to one world concert tour, and Im not ready for it. Not in this lifetime, anyway.\nPLAYBOY: On the subject of your own wealth, the New York Post recently said you admitted to being worth over $150,000,000 and...\nLENNON: We never admitted anything.\nPLAYBOY: The Post said you had.\nLENNON: What the Post says... OK, so we are rich; so what?\nPLAYBOY: The question is, How does that jibe with your political philosophies? Youre supposed to be socialists, arent you?\nLENNON: In England, there are only two things to be, basically: You are either for the labor movement or for the capitalist movement. Either you become a right-wing Archie Bunker if you are in the class I am in, or you become an instinctive socialist, which I was. That meant I think people should get their false teeth and their health looked after, all the rest of it. But apart from that, I worked for money and I wanted to be rich. So what the hell... if thats a paradox, then Im a socialist. But I am not anything. What I used to be is guilty about money. Thats why I lost it, either by giving it away or by allowing myself to be screwed by so-called managers.\nPLAYBOY: Whatever your politics, youve played the capitalist game very well, parlaying your Beatles royalties into real estate, livestock...\nONO: There is no denying that we are still living in the capitalist world. I think that in order to survive and to change the world, you have to take care of yourself first. You have to survive yourself. I used to say to myself, I am the only socialist living here. I dont have a penny. It is all Johns, so Im clean. But I was using his money and I had to face that hypocrisy. I used to think that money was obscene, that the artists didnt have to think about money. But to change society, there are two ways to go: through violence or the power of money within the system. A lot of people in the Sixties went underground and were involved in bombings and other violence. But that is not the way, definitely not for me. So to change the system... even if you are going to become a mayor or something... you need money.\nPLAYBOY: To what extent do you play the game without getting caught up in it... money for the sake of money, in other words?\nONO: There is a limit. It would probably be parallel to our level of security. Do you know what I mean? I mean the emotional-security level as well.\nPLAYBOY: Has it reached that level yet?\nONO: No, not yet. I dont know. It might have.\nPLAYBOY: You mean with $150,000,000? Is that an accurate estimate?\nONO: I dont know what we have. It becomes so complex that you need to have ten accountants working for two years to find out what you have. But lets say that we feel more comfortable now.\nPLAYBOY: How have you chosen to invest your money?\nONO: To make money, you have to spend money. But if you are going to make money, you have to make it with love. I love Egyptian art. I make sure to get all the Egyptian things, not for their value but for their magic power. Each piece has a certain magic power. Also with houses. I just buy ones we love, not the ones that people say are good investments.\nPLAYBOY: The papers have made it sound like you are buying up the Atlantic Seaboard.\nONO: If you saw the houses, you would understand. They have become a good investment, but they are not an investment unless you sell them. We dont intend to sell. Each house is like a historic landmark and theyre very beautiful.\nPLAYBOY: Do you actually use all the properties?\nONO: Most people have the park to go to and run in... the park is a huge place... but John and I were never able to go to the park together. So we have to create our own parks, you know.\nPLAYBOY: We heard that you own $60,000,000 worth of dairy cows. Can that be true?\nONO: I dont know. Im not a calculator. Im not going by figures. Im going by excellence of things.\nLENNON: Sean and I were away for a weekend and Yoko came over to sell this cow and I was joking about it. We hadnt seen her for days; she spent all her time on it. But then I read the paper that said she sold it for a quarter of a million dollars. Only Yoko could sell a cow for that much. \nPLAYBOY: For an artist, your business sense seems remarkable.\nONO: I was doing it just as a chess game. I love chess. I do everything like its a chess game. Not on a Monopoly level... thats a bit more realistic. Chess is more conceptual.\nPLAYBOY: John, do you really need all those houses around the country?\nLENNON: Theyre good business.\nPLAYBOY: Why does anyone need $150,000,000? Couldnt you be perfectly content with $100,000,000? Or $1,000,000?\nLENNON: What would you suggest I do? Give everything away and walk the streets? The Buddhist says, Get rid of the possessions of the mind. Walking away from all the money would not accomplish that. Its like the Beatles. I couldnt walk away from the Beatles. Thats one possession thats still tagging along, right? If I walk away from one house or 400 houses, Im not gonna escape it.\nPLAYBOY: How do you escape it?\nLENNON: It takes time to get rid of all this garbage that Ive been carrying around that was influencing the way I thought and the way I lived. It had a lot to do with Yoko, showing me that I was still possessed. I left physically when I fell in love with Yoko, but mentally it took the last ten years of struggling. I learned everything from her.\nPLAYBOY: You make it sound like a teacher-pupil relationship.\nLENNON: It is a teacher-pupil relationship. Thats what people dont understand. Shes the teacher and Im the pupil. Im the famous one, the one whos supposed to know everything, but shes my teacher. Shes taught me everything I fucking know. She was there when I was nowhere, when I was the nowhere man. Shes my Don Juan. Thats what people dont understand. Im married to fucking Don Juan, thats the hardship of it. Don Juan doesnt have to laugh; Don Juan doesnt have to be charming; Don Juan just is. And what goes on around Don Juan is irrelevant to Don Juan.\nPLAYBOY: Yoko, how do you feel about being Johns teacher?\nONO: Well, he had a lot of experience before he met me, the kind of experience I never had, so I learned a lot from him, too. Its both ways. Maybe its that I have strength, a feminine strength. Because women develop it... in a relationship, I think women really have the inner wisdom and theyre carrying that while men have sort of the wisdom to cope with society, since they created it. Men never developed the inner wisdom; they didnt have time. So most men do rely on womens inner wisdom, whether they express that or not.\nPLAYBOY: Is Yoko Johns guru?\nLENNON: No, a Don Juan doesnt have a following. A Don Juan isnt in the newspaper and doesnt have disciples and doesnt proselytize.\nPLAYBOY: How has she taught you?\nLENNON: When Don Juan said ...when Don Ono said, Get out! Because youre not getting it, well, it was like being sent into the desert. And the reason she wouldnt let me back in was because I wasnt ready to come back in. I had to settle things within myself. When I was ready to come back in, she let me back in. And thats what Im living with.\nPLAYBOY: Youre talking about your separation.\nLENNON: Yes. We were separated in the early Seventies. She kicked me out. Suddenly, I was on a raft alone in the middle of the universe.\nPLAYBOY: What happened?\nLENNON: Well, at first, I thought, Whoopee, whoopee! You know, bachelor life! Whoopee! And then I woke up one day and I thought, What is this? I want to go home! But she wouldnt let me come home. Thats why it was 18 months apart instead of six months. We were talking all the time on the phone and I would say, I dont like this, Im getting in trouble and Id like to come home, please. And she would say, Youre not ready to come home. So what do you say? OK, back to the bottle.\nPLAYBOY: What did she mean, you werent ready?\nLENNON: She has her ways. Whether they be mystical or practical. When she said its not ready, it aint ready.\nPLAYBOY: Back to the bottle?\nLENNON: I was just trying to hide what I felt in the bottle. I was just insane. It was the lost weekend that lasted 18 months. Ive never drunk so much in my life. I tried to drown myself in the bottle and I was with the heaviest drinkers in the business.\nPLAYBOY: Such as?\nLENNON: Such as Harry Nilsson, Bobby Keyes, Keith Moon. We couldnt pull ourselves out. We were trying to kill ourselves. I think Harry might still be trying, poor bugger... God bless you, Harry, wherever you are... but, Jesus, you know, I had to get away from that, because somebody was going to die. Well, Keith did. It was like, whos going to die first? Unfortunately, Keith was the one.\nPLAYBOY: Why the self-destruction?\nLENNON: For me, it was because of being apart. I couldnt stand it. They had their own reasons, and it was, Lets all drown ourselves together. From where I was sitting, it looked like that. Lets kill ourselves but do it like Errol Flynn, you know, the macho, male way. Its embarrassing for me to think about that period, because I made a big fool of myself... but maybe it was a good lesson for me. I wrote Nobody Loves You When Youre Down and Out during that time. Thats how I felt. It exactly expresses the whole period. For some reason, I always imagined Sinatra singing that one. I dont know why. Its kind of a Sinatraesque song, really. He would do a perfect job with it. Are you listening, Frank? You need a song that isnt a piece of nothing. Heres the one for you, the horn arrangement and everythings made for you. But dont ask me to produce it.\nPLAYBOY: That must have been the time the papers came out with reports about Lennon running around town with a Tampax on his head.\nLENNON: The stories were all so exaggerated, but... We were all in a restaurant, drinking, not eating, as usual at those gatherings, and I happened to go take a pee and there was a brand-new fresh Kotex, not Tampax, on the toilet. You know the old trick where you put a penny on your forehead and it sticks? I was a little high and I just picked it up and slapped it on and it stayed, you see. I walked out of the bathroom and I had a Kotex on my head. Big deal. Everybody went Ha-ha-ha and it fell off, but the press blew it up.\nPLAYBOY: Why did you kick John out, Yoko?\nONO: There were many things. Im what I call a moving on kind of girl; theres a song on our new album about it. Rather than deal with problems in relationships, Ive always moved on. Thats why Im one of the very few survivors as a woman, you know. Women tend to be more into men usually, but I wasnt...\nLENNON: Yoko looks upon men as assistants... Of varying degrees of intimacy, but basically assistants. And this ones going to take a pee. \nONO: I have no comment on that. But when I met John, women to him were basically people around who were serving him. He had to open himself up and face me... and I had to see what he was going through. But I thought I had to move on again, because I was suffering being with John.\nPLAYBOY: Why?\nONO: The pressure from the public, being the one who broke up the Beatles and who made it impossible for them to get back together. My artwork suffered, too. I thought I wanted to be free from being Mrs. Lennon, so I thought it would be a good idea for him to go to L.A. and leave me alone for a while. I had put up with it for many years. Even early on, when John was a Beatle, we stayed in a room and John and I were in bed and the door was closed and all that, but we didnt lock the door and one of the Beatle assistants just walked in and talked to him as if I werent there. It was mind-blowing. I was invisible. The people around John saw me as a terrible threat. I mean, I heard there were plans to kill me. Not the Beatles but the people around them.\nPLAYBOY: How did that news affect you?\nONO: The society doesnt understand that the woman can be castrated, too. I felt castrated. Before, I was doing all right, thank you. My work might not have been selling much, I might have been poorer, but I had my pride. But the most humiliating thing is to be looked at as a parasite.\nLENNON: When Yoko and I started doing stuff together, we would hold press conferences and announce our whatevers... were going to wear bags or whatever. And before this one press conference, one Beatle assistant in the upper echelon of Beatle assistants leaned over to Yoko and said, You know, you dont have to work. Youve got enough money, now that youre Mrs. Lennon. And when she complained to me about it, I couldnt understand what she was talking about. But this guy, Id say, Hes just good old Charley, or whatever. Hes been with us 20 years... The same kind of thing happened in the studio. She would say to an engineer, Id like a little more treble, a little more bass, or Theres too much of whatever youre putting on, and theyd look at me and say, What did you say, John? Those days I didnt even notice it myself. Now I know what shes talking about. In Japan, when I ask for a cup of tea in Japanese, they look at Yoko and ask, He wants a cup of tea? in Japanese.\nONO: So a good few years of that kind of thing emasculates you. I had always been more macho than most guys I was with, in a sense. I had always been the breadwinner, because I always wanted to have the freedom and the control. Suddenly, Im with somebody I cant possibly compete with on a level of earnings. Finally, I couldnt take it... or I decided not to take it any longer. I would have had the same difficulty even if I hadnt gotten involved with, ah....\nLENNON: John-- John is the name.\nONO: With John. But John wasnt just John. He was also his group and the people around them. When I say John, its not just John...\nLENNON: Thats John. J-O-H-N. From Johan, I believe.\nPLAYBOY: So you made him leave?\nONO: Yes.\nLENNON: She dont suffer fools gladly, even if shes married to him.\nPLAYBOY: How did you finally get back together?\nONO: It slowly started to dawn on me that John was not the trouble at all. John was a fine person. It was society that had become too much. We laugh about it now, but we started dating again. I wanted to be sure. Im thankful to Johns intelligence...\nLENNON: Now, get that, editors... you got that word?\nONO: ...that he was intelligent enough to know this was the only way that we could save our marriage, not because we didnt love each other but because it was getting too much for me. Nothing would have changed if I had come back as Mrs. Lennon again.\nPLAYBOY: What did change?\nONO: It was good for me to do the business and regain my pride about what I could do. And it was good to know what he needed, the role reversal that was so good for him.\nLENNON: And we learned that its better for the family if we are both working for the family, she doing the business and me playing mother and wife. We reordered our priorities. The number-one priority is her and the family. Everything else revolves around that.\nONO: Its a hard realization. These days, the society prefers single people. The encouragements are to divorce or separate or be single or gay... whatever. Corporations want singles-- they work harder if they dont have family ties. They dont have to worry about being home in the evenings or on the weekends. Theres not much room for emotions about family or personal relationships. You know, the whole thing they say to women approaching 30 that if you dont have a baby in the next few years, youre going to be in trouble, youll never be a mother, so youll never be fulfilled in that way and...\nLENNON: Only Yoko was 73 when she had Sean.\nONO: So instead of the society discouraging children, since they are important for society, it should encourage them. Its the responsibility of everybody. But it is hard. A woman has to deny what she has, her womb, if she wants to make it. It seems that only the privileged classes can have families. Nowadays, maybe its only the McCartneys and the Lennons or something.\nLENNON: Everybody else becomes a worker/consumer.\nONO: And then Big Brother will decide. I hate to use the term Big Brother...\nLENNON: Too late. Theyve got it on tape. \nONO: But, finally, the society...\nLENNON: Big Sister-- wait till she comes!\nONO: The society will do away with the roles of men and women. Babies will be born in test tubes and incubators...\nLENNON: Then its Aldous Huxley.\nONO: But we dont have to go that way. We dont have to deny any of our organs, you know.\nLENNON: Some of my best friends are organs.\nONO: The new album...\nLENNON: Back to the album, very good.\nONO: The album fights these things. The messages are sort of old-fashioned. Family, relationships, children.\nPLAYBOY: The album obviously reflects your new priorities. How have things gone for you since you made that decision?\nLENNON: We got back together, decided this was our life, that having a baby was important to us and that anything else was subsidiary to that. We worked hard for that child. We went through all hell trying to have a baby, through many miscarriages and other problems. He is what they call a love child in truth. Doctors told us we could never have a child. We almost gave up. Well, thats it, then, we cant have one. We were told something was wrong with my sperm, that I abused myself so much in my youth that there was no chance. Yoko was 43, and so they said, no way. She has had too many miscarriages and when she was a young girl, there were no pills, so there were lots of abortions and miscarriages; her stomach must be like Kew Gardens in London. No way. But this Chinese acupuncturist in San Francisco said, You behave yourself. No drugs, eat well, no drink. You have child in 18 months. And we said, But the English doctors said... He said, Forget what they said. You have child. We had Sean and sent the acupuncturist a Polaroid of him just before he died, God rest his soul.\nPLAYBOY: Were there any problems because of Yokos age?\nLENNON: Not because of her age but because of a screw-up in the hospital and the fucking price of fame. Somebody had made a transfusion of the wrong blood type into Yoko. I was there when it happened, and she starts to go rigid, and then shake, from the pain and the trauma. I run up to this nurse and say, Go get the doctor! Im holding on tight to Yoko while this guy gets to the hospital room. He walks in, hardly notices that Yoko is going through fucking convulsions, goes straight for me, smiles, shakes my hand and says, Ive always wanted to meet you, Mr. Lennon, I always enjoyed your music. I start screaming: My wifes dying and you wanna talk about my music! Christ!\nPLAYBOY: Now that Sean is almost five, is he conscious of the fact that his father was a Beatle or have you protected him from your fame?\nLENNON: I havent said anything. Beatles were never mentioned to him. There was no reason to mention it; we never played Beatle records around the house, unlike the story that went around that I was sitting in the kitchen for the past five years, playing Beatle records and reliving my past like some kind of Howard Hughes. He did see Yellow Submarine at a friends, so I had to explain what a cartoon of me was doing in a movie.\nPLAYBOY: Does he have an awareness of the Beatles?\nLENNON: He doesnt differentiate between the Beatles and Daddy and Mommy. He thinks Yoko was a Beatle, too. I dont have Beatle records on the jukebox he listens to. Hes more exposed to early rock n roll. Hes into Hound Dog. He thinks its about hunting. Seans not going to public school, by the way. We feel he can learn the three Rs when he wants to... or when the law says he has to, I suppose. Im not going to fight it. Otherwise, theres no reason for him to be learning to sit still. I cant see any reason for it. Sean now has plenty of child companionship, which everybody says is important, but he also is with adults a lot. Hes adjusted to both. The reason why kids are crazy is because nobody can face the responsibility of bringing them up. Everybodys too scared to deal with children all the time, so we reject them and send them away and torture them. The ones who survive are the conformists. Their bodies are cut to the size of the suits... the ones we label good. The ones who dont fit the suits either are put in mental homes or become artists.\nPLAYBOY: Your son, Julian, from your first marriage must be in his teens. Have you seen him over the years?\nLENNON: Well, Cyn got possession, or whatever you call it. I got rights to see him on his holidays and all that business, and at least theres an open line still going. Its not the best relationship between father and son, but it is there. Hes 17 now. Julian and I will have a relationship in the future. Over the years, hes been able to see through the Beatle image and to see through the image that his mother will have given him, subconsciously or consciously. Hes interested in girls and autobikes now. Im just sort of a figure in the sky, but hes obliged to communicate with me, even when he probably doesnt want to.\nPLAYBOY: Youre being very honest about your feelings toward him to the point of saying that Sean is your first child. Are you concerned about hurting him?\nLENNON: Im not going to lie to Julian. Ninety percent of the people on this planet, especially in the West, were born out of a bottle of whiskey on a Saturday night, and there was no intent to have children. So 90 percent of us... that includes everybody... were accidents. I dont know anybody who was a planned child. All of us were Saturday-night specials. Julian is in the majority, along with me and everybody else. Sean is a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I dont love Julian any less as a child. Hes still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didnt have pills in those days. Hes here, he belongs to me and he always will.\nPLAYBOY: Yoko, your relationship with your daughter has been much rockier.\nONO: I lost Kyoko when she was about five. I was sort of an offbeat mother, but we had very good communication. I wasnt particularly taking care of her, but she was always with me... onstage or at gallery shows, whatever. When she was not even a year old, I took her onstage as an instrument-- an uncontrollable instrument, you know. My communication with her was on the level of sharing conversation and doing things. She was closer to my ex-husband because of that.\nPLAYBOY: What happened when she was five?\nONO: John and I got together and I separated from my ex-husband. He took Kyoko away. It became a case of parent kidnapping and we tried to get her back.\nLENNON: It was a classic case of men being macho. It turned into me and Allen Klein trying to dominate Tony Cox. Tonys attitude was, You got my wife, but you wont get my child. In this battle, Yoko and the child were absolutely forgotten. Ive always felt bad about it. It became a case of the shoot-out at the O.K. Corral: Cox fled to the hills and hid out and the sheriff and I tracked him down. First we won custody in court. Yoko didnt want to go to court, but the men, Klein and I, did it anyway.\nONO: Allen called up one day, saying I won the court case. He gave me a piece of paper. I said, What is this piece of paper? Is this what I won? I dont have my child. I knew that taking them to court would frighten them and, of course, it did frighten them. So Tony vanished. He was very strong, thinking that the capitalists, with their money and lawyers and detectives, were pursuing him. It made him stronger.\nLENNON: We chased him all over the world. God knows where he went. So if youre reading this, Tony, lets grow up about it. Its gone. We dont want to chase you anymore, because weve done enough damage.\nONO: We also had private detectives chasing Kyoko, which I thought was a bad trip, too. One guy came to report, It was great! We almost had them. We were just behind them in a car, but they sped up and got away. I went hysterical. What do you mean you almost got them? We are talking about my child!\nLENNON: It was like we were after an escaped convict.\nPLAYBOY: Were you so persistent because you felt you were better for Kyoko?\nLENNON: Yoko got steamed into a guilt thing that if she wasnt attacking them with detectives and police and the FBI, then she wasnt a good mother looking for her baby. She kept saying, Leave them alone, leave them alone, but they said you cant do that.\nONO: For me, it was like they just disappeared from my life. Part of me left with them.\nPLAYBOY: How old is she now?\nONO: Seventeen, the same as Johns son.\nPLAYBOY: Perhaps when she gets older, shell seek you out.\nONO: She is totally frightened. There was a time in Spain when a lawyer and John thought that we should kidnap her.\nLENNON: I was just going to commit hara-kiri first.\nONO: And we did kidnap her and went to court. The court did a very sensible thing... the judge took her into a room and asked her which one of us she wanted to go with. Of course, she said Tony. We had scared her to death. So now she must be afraid that if she comes to see me, shell never see her father again.\nLENNON: When she gets to be in her 20s, shell understand that we were idiots and we know we were idiots. She might give us a chance.\nONO: I probably would have lost Kyoko even if it wasnt for John. If I had separated from Tony, there would have been some difficulty.\nLENNON: Ill just half-kill myself.\nONO: Part of the reason things got so bad was because with Kyoko, it was you and Tony dealing. Men. With your son Julian, it was women... there was more understanding between me and Cyn.\nPLAYBOY: Can you explain that?\nONO: For example, there was a birthday party that Kyoko had and we were both invited, but John felt very uptight about it and he didnt go. He wouldnt deal with Tony. But we were both invited to Julians party and we both went.\nLENNON: Oh, God, its all coming out.\nONO: Or like when I was invited to Tonys place alone, I couldnt go; but when John was invited to Cyns, he did go.\nLENNON: One rule for the men, one for the women.\nONO: So it was easier for Julian, because I was allowing it to happen.\nLENNON: But Ive said a million Hail Marys. What the hell else can I do?\nPLAYBOY: Yoko, after this experience, how do you feel about leaving Seans rearing to John?\nONO: I am very clear about my emotions in that area. I dont feel guilty. I am doing it in my own way. It may not be the same as other mothers, but Im doing it the way I can do it. In general, mothers have a very strong resentment toward their children, even though theres this whole adulation about motherhood and how mothers really think about their children and how they really love them. I mean, they do, but it is not humanly possible to retain emotion that mothers are supposed to have within this society. Women are just too stretched out in different directions to retain that emotion. Too much is required of them. So I say to John...\nLENNON: I am her favorite husband...\nONO: I am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough, so you take care of it afterward. It did sound like a crude remark, but I really believe that children belong to the society. If a mother carries the child and a father raises it, the responsibility is shared.\nPLAYBOY: Did you resent having to take so much responsibility, John?\nLENNON: Well, sometimes, you know, shed come home and say, Im tired. Id say, only partly tongue in cheek, What the fuck do you think I am? Im 24 hours with the baby! Do you think thats easy? Id say, Youre going to take some more interest in the child. I dont care whether its a father or a mother. When Im going on about pimples and bones and which TV shows to let him watch, I would say, Listen, this is important. I dont want to hear about your $20,000,000 deal tonight! I would like both parents to take care of the children, but how is a different matter.\nONO: Society should be more supportive and understanding.\nLENNON: Its true. The saying Youve come a long way, baby applies more to me than to her. As Harry Nilsson says, Everything is the opposite of what it is, isnt it? Its men whove come a long way from even contemplating the idea of equality. But although there is this thing called the womens movement, society just took a laxative and theyve just farted. They havent really had a good shit yet. The seed was planted sometime in the late Sixties, right? But the real changes are coming. I am the one who has come a long way. I was the pig. And it is a relief not to be a pig. The pressures of being a pig were enormous. I dont have any hankering to be looked upon as a sex object, a male, macho rock n roll singer. I got over that a long time ago. Im not even interested in projecting that. So I like it to be known that, yes, I looked after the baby and I made bread and I was a househusband and I am proud of it. Its the wave of the future and Im glad to be in on the forefront of that, too.\nONO: So maybe both of us learned a lot about how men and women suffer because of the social structure. And the only way to change it is to be aware of it. It sounds simple, but important things are simple.\nPLAYBOY: John, does it take actually reversing roles with women to understand?\nLENNON: It did for this man. But dont forget, Im the one who benefited the most from doing it. Now I can step back and say Sean is going to be five years old and I was able to spend his first five years with him and I am very proud of that. And come to think of it, it looks like Im going to be 40 and life begins at 40-- so they promise. And I believe it, too. I feel fine and Im very excited. Its like, you know, hitting 21, like, Wow, whats going to happen next? Only this time were together\nONO: If two are gathered together, theres nothing you cant do.\nPLAYBOY: What does the title of your new album, Double Fantasy, mean?\nLENNON: Its a flower, a type of freesia, but what it means to us is that if two people picture the same image at the same time, that is the secret. You can be together but projecting two different images and either whoevers the stronger at the time will get his or her fantasy fulfilled or you will get nothing but mishmash.\nPLAYBOY: You saw the news item that said you were putting your sex fantasies out as an album.\nLENNON: Oh, yeah. That is like when we did the bed-in in Toronto in 1969. They all came charging through the door, thinking we were going to be screwing in bed. Of course, we were just sitting there with peace signs.\nPLAYBOY: What was that famous bed-in all about?\nLENNON: Our life is our art. Thats what the bed-ins were. When we got married, we knew our honeymoon was going to be public, anyway, so we decided to use it to make a statement. We sat in bed and talked to reporters for seven days. It was hilarious. In effect, we were doing a commercial for peace on the front page of the papers instead of a commercial for war.\nPLAYBOY: You stayed in bed and talked about peace?\nLENNON: Yes. We answered questions. One guy kept going over the point about Hitler: What do you do about Fascists? How can you have peace when youve got a Hitler? Yoko said, I would have gone to bed with him. She said shed have needed only ten days with him. People loved that one.\nONO: I said it facetiously, of course. But the point is, youre not going to change the world by fighting. Maybe I was naive about the ten days with Hitler. After all, it took 13 years with John Lennon. \nPLAYBOY: What were the reports about your making love in a bag?\nONO: We never made love in a bag. People probably imagined that we were making love. It was just, all of us are in a bag, you know. The point was the outline of the bag, you know, the movement of the bag, how much we see of a person, you know. But, inside, there might be a lot going on. Or maybe nothings going on.\nPLAYBOY: Briefly, what about the statement on the new album?\nLENNON: Very briefly, its about very ordinary things between two people. The lyrics are direct. Simple and straight. I went through my Dylanesque period a long time ago with songs like I am the Walrus ...the trick of never saying what you mean but giving the impression of something more. Where more or less can be read into it. Its a good game.\nPLAYBOY: What are your musical preferences these days?\nLENNON: Well, I like all music, depending on what time of day it is. I dont like styles of music or people per se. I cant say I enjoy the Pretenders, but I like their hit record. I enjoy the B-52s, because I heard them doing Yoko. Its great. If Yoko ever goes back to her old sound, theyll be saying, Yeah, shes copying the B-52s.\nONO: We were doing a lot of the punk stuff a long time ago.\nPLAYBOY: Lennon and Ono, the original punks.\nONO: Youre right.\nPLAYBOY: John, whats your opinion of the newer waves?\nLENNON: I love all this punky stuff. Its pure. Im not, however, crazy about the people who destroy themselves.\nPLAYBOY: You disagree with Neil Youngs lyric in Rust Never Sleeps-- Its better to burn out than to fade away....\nLENNON: I hate it. Its better to fade away like an old soldier than to burn out. I dont appreciate worship of dead Sid Vicious or of dead James Dean or of dead John Wayne. Its the same thing. Making Sid Vicious a hero, Jim Morrison ...its garbage to me. I worship the people who survive. Gloria Swanson, Greta Garbo. Theyre saying John Wayne conquered cancer... he whipped it like a man. You know, Im sorry that he died and all that. Im sorry for his family, but he didnt whip cancer. It whipped him. I dont want Sean worshiping John Wayne or Sid Vicious. What do they teach you? Nothing. Death. Sid Vicious died for what? So that we might rock? I mean, its garbage, you know. If Neil Young admires that sentiment so much, why doesnt he do it? Because he sure as hell faded away and came back many times, like all of us. No, thank you. Ill take the living and the healthy.\nPLAYBOY: Do you listen to the radio?\nLENNON: Muzak or classical. I dont purchase records. I do enjoy listening to things like Japanese folk music or Indian music. My tastes are very broad. When I was a housewife, I just had Muzak on, background music, cuz it relaxes you.\nPLAYBOY: Yoko?\nONO: No.\nPLAYBOY: Do you go out and buy records?\nONO: Or read the newspaper or magazines or watch TV? No.\nPLAYBOY: The inevitable question, John. Do you listen to your records?\nLENNON: Least of all my own.\nPLAYBOY: Even your classics?\nLENNON: Are you kidding? For pleasure, I would never listen to them. When I hear them, I just think of the session. Its like an actor watching himself in an old movie. When I hear a song, I remember the Abbey Road studio, the session, who fought with whom, where I was sitting, banging the tambourine in the corner...\nONO: In fact, we really dont enjoy listening to other peoples work much. We sort of analyze everything we hear.\nPLAYBOY: Yoko, were you a Beatles fan?\nONO: No. Now I notice the songs, of course. In a restaurant, John will point out, Ahh, theyre playing George or something.\nPLAYBOY: John, do you ever go out to hear music?\nLENNON: No, Im not interested. Im not a fan, you see. I might like Jerry Lee Lewis singing A Whole Lot a Shakin on the record, but Im not interested in seeing him perform it.\nPLAYBOY: Your songs are performed more than most other songwriters. How does that feel?\nLENNON: Im always proud and pleased when people do my songs. It gives me pleasure that they even attempt them, because a lot of my songs arent that doable. I go to restaurants and the groups always play Yesterday. I even signed a guys violin in Spain after he played us Yesterday. He couldnt understand that I didnt write the song. But I guess he couldnt have gone from table to table playing I am the Walrus.\nPLAYBOY: How does it feel to have influenced so many people?\nLENNON: It wasnt really me or us. It was the times. It happened to me when I heard rock n roll in the Fifties. I had no idea about doing music as a way of life until rock n roll hit me.\nPLAYBOY: Do you recall what specifically hit you?\nLENNON: It was Rock Around the Clock, I think. I enjoyed Bill Haley, but I wasnt overwhelmed by him. It wasnt until Heartbreak Hotel that I really got into it.\nONO: I am sure there are people whose lives were affected because they heard Indian music or Mozart or Bach. More than anything, it was the time and the place when the Beatles came up. Something did happen there. It was a kind of chemical. It was as if several people gathered around a table and a ghost appeared. It was that kind of communication. So they were like mediums, in a way. Its not something you can force. It was the people, the time, their youth and enthusiasm.\nPLAYBOY: For the sake of argument, well maintain that no other contemporary artist or group of artists moved as many people in such a profound way as the Beatles.\nLENNON: But what moved the Beatles?\nPLAYBOY: You tell us.\nLENNON: Alright. Whatever wind was blowing at the time moved the Beatles, too. Im not saying we werent flags on the top of a ship; but the whole boat was moving. Maybe the Beatles were in the crows-nest, shouting, Land ho, or something like that, but we were all in the same damn boat.\nONO: The Beatles themselves were a social phenomenon not that aware of what they were doing. In a way...\nLENNON: This Beatles talk bores me to death. Turn to page 196.\nONO: As I said, they were like mediums. They werent conscious of all they were saying, but it was coming through them.\nPLAYBOY: Why?\nLENNON: We tuned in to the message. Thats all. I dont mean to belittle the Beatles when I say they werent this, they werent that. Im just trying not to overblow their importance as separate from society. And I dont think they were more important than Glenn Miller or Woody Herman or Bessie Smith. It was our generation, thats all. It was Sixties music.\nPLAYBOY: What do you say to those who insist that all rock since the Beatles has been the Beatles redone?\nLENNON: All music is rehash. There are only a few notes. Just variations on a theme. Try to tell the kids in the Seventies who were screaming to the Bee Gees that their music was just the Beatles redone. There is nothing wrong with the Bee Gees. They do a damn good job. There was nothing else going on then.\nPLAYBOY: Wasnt alot of the Beatles music at least more intelligent?\nLENNON: The Beatles were more intellectual, so they appealed on that level, too. But the basic appeal of the Beatles was not their intelligence. It was their music. It was only after some guy in the London Times said there were Aeolian cadences in It Wont Be Long that the middle classes started listening to it... because somebody put a tag on it.\nPLAYBOY: Did you put Aeolian cadences in It Wont Be Long?\nLENNON: To this day, I dont have any idea what they are. They sound like exotic birds.\nPLAYBOY: How did you react to the misinterpretations of your songs?\nLENNON: For instance?\nPLAYBOY: The most obvious is the Paul is dead fiasco. You already explained the line in Glass Onion. What about the line in I am the Walrus... ...I buried Paul?\nLENNON: I said Cranberry sauce. Thats all I said. Some people like ping-pong, other people like digging over graves. Some people will do anything rather than be here now.\nPLAYBOY: What about the chant at the end of the song: Smoke pot, smoke pot, everybody smoke pot?\nLENNON: No, no, no. I had this whole choir saying, Everybodys got one, everybodys got one. But when you get 30 people, male and female, on top of 30 cellos and on top of the Beatles rock n roll rhythm section, you cant hear what theyre saying.\nPLAYBOY: What does everybody got?\nLENNON: Anything. You name it. One penis, one vagina, one asshole-- you name it.\nPLAYBOY: Did it trouble you when the interpretations of your songs were destructive, such as when Charles Manson claimed that your lyrics were messages to him?\nLENNON: No. It has nothing to do with me. Its like that guy, Son of Sam, who was having these talks with the dog. Manson was just an extreme version of the people who came up with the Paul is dead thing or who figured out that the initials to Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds were LSD and concluded I was writing about acid.\nPLAYBOY: Where did Lucy in the Sky come from?\nLENNON: My son Julian came in one day with a picture he painted about a school friend of his named Lucy. He had sketched in some stars in the sky and called it Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Simple.\nPLAYBOY: The other images in the song werent drug-inspired?\nLENNON: The images were from Alice in Wonderland. It was Alice in the boat. She is buying an egg and it turns into Humpty Dumpty. The woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep and the next minute they are rowing in a rowing boat somewhere and I was visualizing that. There was also the image of the female who would someday come save me... a girl with kaleidoscope eyes who would come out of the sky. It turned out to be Yoko, though I hadnt met Yoko yet. So maybe it should be Yoko in the Sky with Diamonds.\nPLAYBOY: Do you have any interest in the pop historians analyzing the Beatles as a cultural phenomenon?\nLENNON: Its all equally irrelevant. Mine is to do and other peoples is to record, I suppose. Does it matter how many drugs were in Elvis body? I mean, Brian Epsteins sex life will make a nice Hollywood Babylon someday, but it is irrelevant.\nPLAYBOY: What started the rumors about you and Epstein?\nLENNON: I went on holiday to Spain with Brian... which started all the rumors that he and I were having a love affair. Well, it was almost a love affair, but not quite. It was never consummated. But we did have a pretty intense relationship. And it was my first experience with someone I knew was a homosexual. He admitted it to me. We had this holiday together because Cyn was pregnant and we left her with the baby and went to Spain. Lots of funny stories, you know. We used to sit in cafs and Brian would look at all the boys and I would ask, Do you like that one? Do you like this one? It was just the combination of our closeness and the trip that started the rumors.\nPLAYBOY: Its interesting to hear you talk about your old songs such as Lucy in the Sky and Glass Onion. Will you give some brief thoughts on some of our favorites?\nLENNON: Right.\nPLAYBOY: Lets start with In My Life.\nLENNON: It was the first song I wrote that was consciously about my life. There are places Ill remember/ all my life though some have changed... Before, we were just writing songs a la Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly-- pop songs with no more thought to them than that. The words were almost irrelevant. In My Life started out as a bus journey from my house at 250 Menlove Avenue to town, mentioning all the places I could recall. I wrote it all down and it was boring. So I forgot about it and laid back and these lyrics started coming to me about friends and lovers of the past. Paul helped with the middle-eight.\nPLAYBOY: Yesterday.\nLENNON: Well, we all know about Yesterday. I have had so much accolade for Yesterday. That is Pauls song, of course, and Pauls baby. Well done. Beautiful-- and I never wished I had written it.\nPLAYBOY: With a Little Help from My Friends.\nLENNON: This is Paul, with a little help from me. What do you see when you turn out the light/ I cant tell you, but I know its mine... is mine.\nPLAYBOY: I am the Walrus.\nLENNON: The first line was written on one acid trip one weekend. The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend, and it was filled in after I met Yoko. Part of it was putting down Hare Krishna. All these people were going on about Hare Krishna, Allen Ginsberg in particular. The reference to Elementry penguin is the elementary, naive attitude of going around chanting, Hare Krishna, or putting all your faith in any one idol. I was writing obscurely, a la Dylan, in those days.\nPLAYBOY: The song is very complicated, musically.\nLENNON: It actually was fantastic in stereo, but you never hear it all. There was too much to get on. It was too messy a mix. One track was live BBC Radio-- Shakespeare or something-- I just fed in whatever lines came in.\nPLAYBOY: What about the walrus itself?\nLENNON: Its from The Walrus and the Carpenter. Alice in Wonderland. To me, it was a beautiful poem. It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system. I never went into that bit about what he really meant, like people are doing with the Beatles work. Later, I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy. I thought, Oh, shit, I picked the wrong guy. I should have said, I am the carpenter. But that wouldnt have been the same, would it? I am the carpenter....\nPLAYBOY: How about She Came in Through the Bathroom Window?\nLENNON: That was written by Paul when we were in New York forming Apple, and he first met Linda. Maybe shes the one who came in the window. She must have. I dont know. Somebody came in the window.\nPLAYBOY: I Feel Fine.\nLENNON: Thats me, including the guitar lick with the first feedback ever recorded. I defy anybody to find an earlier record... unless it is some old blues record from the Twenties... with feedback on it.\nPLAYBOY: When Im Sixty-Four.\nLENNON: Paul completely. I would never even dream of writing a song like that. There are some areas I never think about and that is one of them.\nPLAYBOY: A Day in the Life.\nLENNON: Just as it sounds: I was reading the paper one day and I noticed two stories. One was the Guinness heir who killed himself in a car. That was the main headline story. He died in London in a car crash. On the next page was a story about 4000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire. In the streets, that is. They were going to fill them all. Pauls contribution was the beautiful little lick in the song Id love to turn you on. I had the bulk of the song and the words, but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he couldnt use for anything. I thought it was a damn good piece of work.\nPLAYBOY: May we continue with some of the ones that seem more personal and see what reminiscences they inspire?\nLENNON: Reminisce away.\nPLAYBOY: For no reason whatsoever, lets start with I Wanna Be Your Man.\nLENNON: Paul and I finished that one off for the Stones. We were taken down by Brian to meet them at the club where they were playing in Richmond. They wanted a song and we went to see what kind of stuff they did. Paul had this bit of a song and we played it roughly for them and they said, Yeah, OK, thats our style. But it was only really a lick, so Paul and I went off in the corner of the room and finished the song off while they were all sitting there, talking. We came back and Mick and Keith said, Jesus, look at that. They just went over there and wrote it. You know, right in front of their eyes. We gave it to them. It was a throwaway. Ringo sang it for us and the Stones did their version. It shows how much importance we put on them. We werent going to give them anything great, right? That was the Stones first record. Anyway, Mick and Keith said, If they can write a song so easily, we should try it. They say it inspired them to start writing together.\nPLAYBOY: How about Strawberry Fields Forever?\nLENNON: Strawberry Fields is a real place. After I stopped living at Penny Lane, I moved in with my auntie who lived in the suburbs in a nice semidetached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around... not the poor slummy kind of image that was projected in all the Beatles stories. In the class system, it was about half a class higher than Paul, George and Ringo, who lived in government-subsidized housing. We owned our house and had a garden. They didnt have anything like that. Near that home was Strawberry Fields, a house near a boys reformatory where I used to go to garden parties as a kid with my friends Nigel and Pete. We would go there and hang out and sell lemonade bottles for a penny. We always had fun at Strawberry Fields. So thats where I got the name. But I used it as an image. Strawberry Fields forever.\nPLAYBOY: And the lyrics, for instance: Living is easy...\nLENNON: ...with eyes closed. Misunderstanding all you see. It still goes, doesnt it? Arent I saying exactly the same thing now? The awareness apparently trying to be expressed is-- lets say in one way I was always hip. I was hip in kindergarten. I was different from the others. I was different all my life. The second verse goes, No one I think is in my tree. Well, I was too shy and self-doubting. Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what I was saying. Therefore, I must be crazy or a genius-- I mean it must be high or low, the next line. There was something wrong with me, I thought, because I seemed to see things other people didnt see. I thought I was crazy or an egomaniac for claiming to see things other people didnt see. As a child, I would say, But this is going on! and everybody would look at me as if I was crazy. I always was so psychic or intuitive or poetic or whatever you want to call it, that I was always seeing things in a hallucinatory way. It was scary as a child, because there was nobody to relate to. Neither my auntie nor my friends nor anybody could ever see what I did. It was very, very scary and the only contact I had was reading about an Oscar Wilde or a Dylan Thomas or a Vincent van Gogh-- all those books that my auntie had that talked about their suffering because of their visions. Because of what they saw, they were tortured by society for trying to express what they were. I saw loneliness.\nPLAYBOY: Were you able to find others to share your visions with?\nLENNON: Only dead people in books. Lewis Carroll, certain paintings. Surrealism had a great effect on me, because then I realized that my imagery and my mind wasnt insanity; that if it was insane, I belong in an exclusive club that sees the world in those terms. Surrealism to me is reality. Psychic vision to me is reality. Even as a child. When I looked at myself in the mirror or when I was 12, 13, I used to literally trance out into alpha. I didnt know what it was called then. I found out years later there is a name for those conditions. But I would find myself seeing hallucinatory images of my face changing and becoming cosmic and complete. It caused me to always be a rebel. This thing gave me a chip on the shoulder; but, on the other hand, I wanted to be loved and accepted. Part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and not be this loudmouthed lunatic musician. But I cannot be what I am not. Because of my attitude, all the other boys parents, including Pauls father, would say, Keep away from him. The parents instinctively recognized what I was, which was a troublemaker, meaning I did not conform and I would influence their kids, which I did. I did my best to disrupt every friends home I had. Partly, maybe, it was out of envy that I didnt have this so-called home. But I really did. I had an auntie and an uncle and a nice suburban home, thank you very much. Hear this, Auntie. She was hurt by a remark Paul made recently that the reason I am staying home with Sean now is because I never had a family life. Its absolute rubbish. There were five women who were my family. Five strong, intelligent women. Five sisters. One happened to be my mother. My mother was the youngest. She just couldnt deal with life. She had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she couldnt cope with me, and when I was four and a half, I ended up living with her elder sister. Now, those women were fantastic. One day I might do a kind of Forsyte Saga just about them. That was my first feminist education. Anyway, that knowledge and the fact that I wasnt with my parents made me see that parents are not gods. I would infiltrate the other boys minds. Pauls parents were terrified of me and my influence, simply because I was free from the parents strangle hold. That was the gift I got for not having parents. I cried a lot about not having them and it was torture, but it also gave me an awareness early. I wasnt an orphan, though. My mother was alive and lived a 15-minute walk away from me all my life. I saw her off and on. I just didnt live with her.\nPLAYBOY: Is she alive?\nLENNON: No, she got killed by an off-duty cop who was drunk after visiting my aunties house where I lived. I wasnt there at the time. She was just at a bus stop. I was 16. That was another big trauma for me. I lost her twice. When I was five and I moved in with my auntie, and then when she physically died. That made me more bitter; the chip on my shoulder I had as a youth got really big then. I was just really re-establishing the relationship with her and she was killed.\nPLAYBOY: Her name was Julia, wasnt it? Is she the Julia of your song of that name on The White Album?\nLENNON: The song is for her... and for Yoko.\nPLAYBOY: What kind of relationship did you have with your father, who went away to sea? Did you ever see him again?\nLENNON: I never saw him again until I made a lot of money and he came back.\nPLAYBOY: How old were you?\nLENNON: 24 or 25. I opened the Daily Express and there he was, washing dishes in a small hotel or something very near where I was living in the Stockbroker belt outside London. He had been writing to me to try to get in contact. I didnt want to see him. I was too upset about what hed done to me and to my mother and that he would turn up when I was rich and famous and not bother turning up before. So I wasnt going to see him at all, but he sort of blackmailed me in the press by saying all this about being a poor man washing dishes while I was living in luxury. I fell for it and saw him and we had some kind of relationship. He died a few years later of cancer. But at 65, he married a secretary who had been working for the Beatles, age 22, and they had a child, which I thought was hopeful for a man who had lived his life as a drunk and almost a Bowery bum.\nPLAYBOY: Well never listen to Strawberry Fields Forever the same way again. What memories are jogged by the song Help?\nLENNON: When Help came out in 65, I was actually crying out for help. Most people think its just a fast rock n roll song. I didnt realize it at the time; I just wrote the song because I was commissioned to write it for the movie. But later, I knew I really was crying out for help. It was my fat Elvis period. You see the movie: He -- I -- is very fat, very insecure, and hes completely lost himself. And I am singing about when I was so much younger and all the rest, looking back at how easy it was. Now I may be very positive... yes, yes... but I also go through deep depressions where I would like to jump out the window, you know. It becomes easier to deal with as I get older; I dont know whether you learn control or, when you grow up, you calm down a little. Anyway, I was fat and depressed and I was crying out for help. In those days, when the Beatles were depressed, we had this little chant. I would yell out, Where are we going, fellows? They would say, To the top, Johnny, in pseudo-American voices. And I would say, Where is that, fellows? And they would say, To the toppermost of the poppermost. It was some dumb expression from a cheap movie, a la Blackboard Jungle, about Liverpool. Johnny was the leader of the gang.\nPLAYBOY: What were you depressed about during the Help period?\nLENNON: The Beatles thing had just gone beyond comprehension. We were smoking marijuana for breakfast. We were well into marijuana and nobody could communicate with us, because we were just all glazed eyes, giggling all the time. In our own world. That was the song, Help. I think everything that comes out of a song-- even Pauls songs now, which are apparently about nothing-- shows something about yourself.\nPLAYBOY: Was Im a Loser a similarly personal statement?\nLENNON: Part of me suspects that Im a loser and the other part of me thinks Im God Almighty.\nPLAYBOY: How about Cold Turkey?\nLENNON: The song is self-explanatory. The song got banned, even though its antidrug. Theyre so stupid about drugs, you know. Theyre not looking at the cause of the drug problem: Why do people take drugs? To escape from what? Is life so terrible? Are we living in such a terrible situation that we cant do anything without reinforcement of alcohol, tobacco? Aspirins, sleeping pills, uppers, downers, never mind the heroin and cocaine-- theyre just the outer fringes of Librium and speed.\nPLAYBOY: Do you use any drugs now?\nLENNON: Not really. If somebody gives me a joint, I might smoke it, but I dont go after it.\nPLAYBOY: Cocaine?\nLENNON: Ive had cocaine, but I dont like it. The Beatles had lots of it in their day, but its a dumb drug, because you have to have another one 20 minutes later. Your whole concentration goes on getting the next fix. Really, I find caffeine is easier to deal with.\nPLAYBOY: Acid?\nLENNON: Not in years. A little mushroom or peyote is not beyond my scope, you know, maybe twice a year or something. You dont hear about it anymore, but people are still visiting the cosmos. We must always remember to thank the CIA and the Army for LSD. Thats what people forget. Everything is the opposite of what it is, isnt it, Harry? So get out the bottle, boy... and relax. They invented LSD to control people and what they did was give us freedom. Sometimes it works in mysterious ways its wonders to perform. If you look in the Government reports on acid, the ones who jumped out the window or killed themselves because of it, I think even with Art Linkletters daughter, it happened to her years later. So, lets face it, she wasnt really on acid when she jumped out the window. And Ive never met anybody whos had a flashback on acid. Ive never had a flashback in my life and I took millions of trips in the Sixties.\nPLAYBOY: What does your diet include besides sashimi and sushi, Hershey bars and cappuccinos?\nLENNON: Were mostly macrobiotic, but sometimes I take the family out for a pizza.\nONO: Intuition tells you what to eat. Its dangerous to try to unify things. Everybody has different needs. We went through vegetarianism and macrobiotic, but now, because were in the studio, we do eat some junk food. Were trying to stick to macrobiotic: fish and rice, whole grains. You balance foods and eat foods indigenous to the area. Corn is the grain from this area.\nPLAYBOY: And you both smoke up a storm.\nLENNON: Macrobiotic people dont believe in the big C. Whether you take that as a rationalization or not, macrobiotics dont believe that smoking is bad for you. Of course, if we die, were wrong.\nPLAYBOY: Lets go back to jogging your memory with songs. How about Pauls song Hey Jude?\nLENNON: He said it was written about Julian. He knew I was splitting with Cyn and leaving Julian then. He was driving to see Julian to say hello. He had been like an uncle. And he came up with Hey Jude. But I always heard it as a song to me. Now Im sounding like one of those fans reading things into it... Think about it: Yoko had just come into the picture. He is saying. Hey, Jude-- Hey, John. Subconsciously, he was saying, Go ahead, leave me. On a conscious level, he didnt want me to go ahead. The angel in him was saying, Bless you. The devil in him didnt like it at all, because he didnt want to lose his partner.\nPLAYBOY: What about Because?\nLENNON: I was lying on the sofa in our house, listening to Yoko play Beethovens Moonlight Sonata on the piano. Suddenly, I said, Can you play those chords backward? She did, and I wrote Because around them. The song sounds like Moonlight Sonata, too. The lyrics are clear, no bullshit, no imagery, no obscure references.\nPLAYBOY: Give Peace a Chance.\nLENNON: All we were saying was give peace a chance.\nPLAYBOY: Was it really a Lennon-McCartney composition?\nLENNON: No, I dont even know why his name was on it. Its there because I kind of felt guilty because Id made the separate single-- the first-- and I was really breaking away from the Beatles.\nPLAYBOY: Why were the compositions you and Paul did separately attributed to Lennon-McCartney?\nLENNON: Paul and I made a deal when we were 15. There was never a legal deal between us, just a deal we made when we decided to write together that we put both our names on it, no matter what.\nPLAYBOY: How about Do You Want to Know a Secret?\nLENNON: The idea came from this thing my mother used to sing to me when I was one or two years old, when she was still living with me. It was from a Disney movie: Do you want to know a secret? Promise not to tell? You are standing by a wishing well. So, with that in my head, I wrote the song and just gave it to George to sing. I thought it would be a good vehicle for him, because it had only three notes and he wasnt the best singer in the world. He has improved a lot since then; but in those days, his ability was very poor. I gave it to him just to give him a piece of the action. Thats another reason why I was hurt by his book. I even went to the trouble of making sure he got the B side of a Beatles single, because he hadnt had a B side of one until Do You Want to Know a Secret. Something was the first time he ever got an A side, because Paul and I always wrote both sides. That wasnt because we were keeping him out but simply because his material was not up to scratch. I made sure he got the B side of Something, too, so he got the cash. Those little things he doesnt remember. I always felt bad that George and Ringo didnt get a piece of the publishing. When the opportunity came to give them five percent each of Maclen, it was because of me they got it. It was not because of Klein and not because of Paul but because of me. When I said they should get it, Paul couldnt say no. I dont get a piece of any of Georges songs or Ringos. I never asked for anything for the contributions I made to Georges songs like Taxman. Not even the recognition. And that is why I might have sounded resentful about George and Ringo, because it was after all those things that the attitude of John has forsaken us and John is tricking us came out... which is not true.\nPLAYBOY: Happiness Is a Warm Gun.\nLENNON: No, its not about heroin. A gun magazine was sitting there with a smoking gun on the cover and an article that I never read inside called Happiness Is a Warm Gun. I took it right from there. I took it as the terrible idea of just having shot some animal.\nPLAYBOY: What about the sexual puns: When you feel my finger on your trigger?\nLENNON: Well, it was at the beginning of my relationship with Yoko and I was very sexually oriented then. When we werent in the studio, we were in bed.\nPLAYBOY: What was the allusion to Mother Superior jumps the gun?\nLENNON: I call Yoko Mother or Madam just in an offhand way. The rest doesnt mean anything. Its just images of her.\nPLAYBOY: Across the Universe.\nLENNON: The Beatles didnt make a good record of Across the Universe. I think subconsciously we... I thought Paul subconsciously tried to destroy my great songs. We would play experimental games with my great pieces, like Strawberry Fields, which I always felt was badly recorded. It worked, but it wasnt what it could have been. I allowed it, though. We would spend hours doing little, detailed cleaning up on Pauls songs, but when it came to mine... especially a great song like Strawberry Fields or Across the Universe ...somehow an atmosphere of looseness and experimentation would come up.\nPLAYBOY: Sabotage?\nLENNON: Subconscious sabotage. I was too hurt... Paul will deny it, because he has a bland face and will say this doesnt exist. This is the kind of thing Im talking about where I was always seeing what was going on and began to think, Well, maybe Im paranoid. But it is not paranoid. It is the absolute truth. The same thing happened to Across the Universe. The song was never done properly. The words stand, luckily.\nPLAYBOY: Getting Better.\nLENNON: It is a diary form of writing. All that I used to be cruel to my woman, I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved was me. I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically... any woman. I was a hitter. I couldnt express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace, you see. It is the most violent people who go for love and peace. Everythings the opposite. But I sincerely believe in love and peace. I am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence. I will have to be a lot older before I can face in public how I treated women as a youngster.\nPLAYBOY: Revolution.\nLENNON: We recorded the song twice. The Beatles were getting really tense with one another. I did the slow version and I wanted it out as a single: as a statement of the Beatles position on Vietnam and the Beatles position on revolution. For years, on the Beatle tours, Epstein had stopped us from saying anything about Vietnam or the war. And he wouldnt allow questions about it. But on one tour, I said, I am going to answer about the war. We cant ignore it. I absolutely wanted the Beatles to say something. The first take of Revolution ...well, George and Paul were resentful and said it wasnt fast enough. Now, if you go into details of what a hit record is and isnt... maybe. But the Beatles could have afforded to put out the slow, understandable version of Revolution as a single. Whether it was a gold record or a wooden record. But because they were so upset about the Yoko period and the fact that I was again becoming as creative and dominating as I had been in the early days, after lying fallow for a couple of years, it upset the apple cart. I was awake again and they couldnt stand it?\nPLAYBOY: Was it Yokos inspiration?\nLENNON: She inspired all this creation in me. It wasnt that she inspired the songs; she inspired me. The statement in Revolution was mine. The lyrics stand today. Its still my feeling about politics. I want to see the plan. That is what I used to say to Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. Count me out if it is for violence. Dont expect me to be on the barricades unless it is with flowers.\nPLAYBOY: What do you think of Hoffmans turning himself in?\nLENNON: Well he got what he wanted. Which is to be sort of an underground hero for anybody who still worships any manifestation of the underground. I dont feel that much about it anymore. Nixon, Hoffman, its the same. They are all from the same period. It was kind of surprising to see Abbie on TV, but it was also surprising to see Nixon on TV. Maybe people get the feeling when they see me or us. I feel, What are they doing there? Is this an old newsreel?\nPLAYBOY: On a new album, you close with Hard Times Are Over . Why?\nLENNON: Its not a new message: Give Peace a Chance-- were not being unreasonable, just saying, Give it a chance. With Imagine, were saying, Can you imagine a world without countries or religions? Its the same message over and over. And its positive.\nPLAYBOY: How does it feel to have people anticipate your new record because they feel you are a prophet of sorts? When you returned to the studio to make Double Fantasy, some of your fans were saying things like, Just as Lennon defined the Sixties and the Seventies, hell be defining the Eighties.\nLENNON: Its very sad. Anyway, were not saying anything new. A) we have already said it and, B) 100,000,000 other people have said it, too.\nPLAYBOY: But your songs do have messages.\nLENNON: All we are saying is, This is what is happening to us. We are sending postcards. I dont let it become I am the awakened; you are sheep that will be shown the way. That is the danger of saying anything, you know.\nPLAYBOY: Especially for you.\nLENNON: Listen, theres nothing wrong with following examples. We can have figure heads and people we admire, but we dont need leaders. Dont follow leaders, watch the parking meters.\nPLAYBOY: Youre quoting one of your peers, of sorts. Is it distressing to you that Dylan is a born-again Christian?\nLENNON: I dont like to comment on it. For whatever reason hes doing it, it is personal for him and he needs to do it. But the whole religion business suffers from the Onward, Christian Soldiers bit. Theres too much talk about soldiers and marching and converting. Im not pushing Buddhism, because Im no more a Buddhist than I am a Christian, but theres one thing I admire about the religion: Theres no proselytizing.\nPLAYBOY: Were you a Dylan fan?\nLENNON: No, I stopped listening to Dylan with both ears after Highway 64 and Blonde on Blonde, and even then it was because George would sit me down and make me listen.\nPLAYBOY: Like Dylan, werent you also looking for some kind of leader when you did primal-scream therapy with Arthur Janov?\nONO: I think Janov was a daddy for John. I think he has this father complex and hes always searching for a daddy.\nLENNON: Had, dear. I had a father complex.\nPLAYBOY: Would you explain?\nONO: I had a daddy, a real daddy, sort of a big and strong father like a Billy Graham, but growing up, I saw his weak side. I saw the hypocrisy. So whenever I see something that is supposed to be so big and wonderful, a guru or primal scream, Im very cynical.\nLENNON: She fought with Janov all the time. He couldnt deal with it.\nONO: Im not searching for the big daddy. I look for something else in men... something that is tender and weak and I feel like I want to help.\nLENNON: And I was the lucky cripple she chose!\nONO: I have this mother instinct, or whatever. But I was not hung up on finding a father, because I had one who disillusioned me. John never had a chance to get disillusioned about his father, since his father wasnt around, so he never thought of him as that big man.\nPLAYBOY: Do you agree with that assessment, John?\nLENNON: Alot of us are looking for fathers. Mine was physically not there. Most peoples are not there mentally and physically, like always at the office or busy with other things. So all these leaders, parking meters, are all substitute fathers, whether they be religious or political... All this bit about electing a President. We pick our own daddy out of a dog pound of daddies. This is the daddy that looks like the daddy in the commercials. Hes got the nice gray hair and the right teeth and the partings on the right side. OK? This is the daddy we choose. The dog pound of daddies, which is the political arena, gives us a President, then we put him on a platform and start punishing him and screaming at him because Daddy cant do miracles. Daddy doesnt heal us.\nPLAYBOY: So Janov was a daddy for you. Who else?\nONO: Before, there was Maharishi.\nLENNON: Maharishi was a father figure, Elvis Presley might have been a father figure. I dont know. Robert Mitchum. Any male image is a father figure. Theres nothing wrong with it until you give them the right to give you sort of a recipe for your life. What happens is somebody comes along with a good piece of truth. Instead of the truths being looked at, the person who brought it is looked at. The messenger is worshiped, instead of the message. So there would be Christianity, Mohammedanism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Marxism, Maoism-- everything-- it is always about a person and never about what he says.\nONO: All the isms are daddies. Its sad that society is structured in such a way that people cannot really open up to each other, and therefore they need a certain theater to go to to cry or something like that.\nLENNON: Well, you went to est.\nONO: Yes, I wanted to check it out.\nLENNON: We went to Janov for the same reason.\nONO: But est people are given a reminder...\nLENNON: Yeah, but I wouldnt go and sit in a room and not pee.\nONO: Well, you did in primal scream.\nLENNON: Oh, but I had you with me.\nONO: Anyway, when I went to est, I saw Werner Erhardt, the same thing. Hes a nice showman and hes got a nice gig there. I felt the same thing when we went to Sai Baba in India. In India, you have to be a guru instead of a pop star. Guru is the pop star of India and pop star is the guru here.\nLENNON: But nobodys perfect, etc., etc. Whether its Janov or Erhardt or Maharishi or a Beatle. That doesnt take away from their message. Its like learning how to swim. The swimming is fine. But forget about the teacher. If the Beatles had a message, it was that. With the Beatles, the records are the point, not the Beatles as individuals. You dont need the package, just as you dont need the Christian package or the Marxist package to get the message. People always got the image I was an anti-Christ or antireligion. Im not. Im a most religious fellow. I was brought up a Christian and I only now understand some of the things that Christ was saying in those parables. Because people got hooked on the teacher and missed the message.\nPLAYBOY: And the Beatles taught people how to swim?\nLENNON: If the Beatles or the Sixties had a message, it was to learn to swim. Period. And once you learn to swim, swim. The people who are hung up on the Beatles and the Sixties dream missed the whole point when the Beatles and the Sixties dream became the point. Carrying the Beatles or the Sixties dream around all your life is like carrying the Second World War and Glenn Miller around. Thats not to say you cant enjoy Glenn Miller or the Beatles, but to live in that dream is the twilight zone. Its not living now. Its an illusion.\nPLAYBOY: Yoko, the single you and John released from your album seems to be looking toward the future.\nONO: Yes, Starting Over is a song that makes me feel like crying. John has talked about the Sixties and how it gave us a taste for freedom... sexual and otherwise. It was like an orgy. Then, after that big come that we had together, men and women somehow lost track of each other and a lot of families and relationships split apart. I really think that what happened in the Seventies can be compared to what happened under Nazism with Jewish families. Only the force that split them came from the inside, not from the outside. We tried to rationalize it as the price we were paying for our freedom. And John is saying in his song, OK, we had the energy in the Sixties, in the Seventies we separated, but lets start over in the Eighties. Hes reaching out to me, the woman. Reaching out after all thats happened, over the battlefield of dead families, is more difficult this time around. On the other side of the record is my song, Kiss Kiss Kiss, which is the other side of the same question. There is the sound of a woman coming to a climax on it, and she is crying out to be held, to be touched. It will be controversial, because people still feel its less natural to hear the sounds of a womans lovemaking than, say, the sound of a Concorde, killing the atmosphere and polluting nature. Altogether, both sides are a prayer to change the Eighties.\nPLAYBOY: What is the Eighties dream to you, John?\nLENNON: Well, you make your own dream. Thats the Beatles story, isnt it? Thats Yokos story. Thats what Im saying now. Produce your own dream. If you want to save Peru, go save Peru. Its quite possible to do anything, but not to put it on the leaders and the parking meters. Dont expect Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan or John Lennon or Yoko Ono or Bob Dylan or Jesus Christ to come and do it for you. You have to do it yourself. Thats what the great masters and mistresses have been saying ever since time began. They can point the way, leave signposts and little instructions in various books that are now called holy and worshiped for the cover of the book and not for what it says, but the instructions are all there for all to see, have always been and always will be. Theres nothing new under the sun. All the roads lead to Rome. And people cannot provide it for you. I cant wake you up. You can wake you up. I cant cure you. You can cure you.\nPLAYBOY: What is it that keeps people from accepting that message?\nLENNON: Its fear of the unknown. The unknown is what it is. And to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams, illusions, wars, peace, love, hate, all that... its all illusion. Unknown is what what it is. Accept that its unknown and its plain sailing. Everything is unknown... then youre ahead of the game. Thats what it is.

The boys hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them.\n2.\tEXT. TERMINAL\nThey rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates.\n3.\tEXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM\nWe see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys.\nNORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums. NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing.\nAs the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls.\nAt last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings. JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, its not my fault and the number proceeds.\nSHOT of sudden horror on JOHNs face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them.\nAs the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.\nTHE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out.\n4.\tINTERIOR RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN\nThe boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof.\nThe three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window.\nPAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again.\nThe boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.\nJOHN\nEh ... pardon me for asking but whos that little old man?\nPAUL\nWhat little old man?\nJOHN\nThat little old man.\nPAUL\nOh, that one. Thats me Grandfather.\nGEORGE\nThats not your Grandfather.\nPAUL\nIt is, yknow.\nGEORGE\nBut your Grandfather lives in your house. Ive seen him.\nPAUL\nOh, thats me other Grandfather, but this ones me Grandfather and all.\nJOHN\nHow dyou reckon that one out?\nPAUL\nWell ... everyones entitled to two, arent they, and this is me other one.\nJOHN\nWell we know that but whats he doing here?\nPAUL\nWell, me mother thought the trip ud do him good.\nRINGO\nHows that?\nPAUL\nOh ... hes nursing a broken heart.\nThe lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.\nJOHN\nAah ... the poor old thing.\nHe leans across to GRANDFATHER.\nJOHN\nEh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then?\nThe GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that indicates yes.\nPAUL\nYou see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.\nGEORGE\nA butcher?\nPAUL\nYeah, she was fickle.\nJOHN\nAye and fond of fresh meat and all.\nPAUL\nNo ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought itud give him a change of scenery, like.\nJOHN\nOh, I see.\nHe inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.\nJOHN\nEh, hes a nice old man, isnt he?\nPAUL\nOh yeah, hes very clean, yknow.\nThey all agree with PAUL.\nJOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him.\nJOHN\nHello, Grandfather!\nGRANDFATHER\nHello.\nJOHN\nHe can talk then?\nPAUL\nCourse he can talk. Hes a human being, like. Isnt he?\nRINGO\nWell ... if hes your Grandfather, who knows?\nThe lads all laugh.\nJOHN\nAnd were looking after him, are we?\nGRANDFATHER\nIll look after meself.\nPAUL\nAye, thats what Im afraid of!\nJOHN\nHes got you worried, then?\nPAUL\nHim, he costs you a fortune in breach-of-promise cases. Hes a villain and a right mixer as well.\nGEORGE\nGerron.\nPAUL\nNo, straight up.\nGRANDFATHER\nThe lads given you the simple truth. Im cursed wid irresistible charm, Im too attractive to be let loose.\nAt this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment.\nSHAKE\nYou got on all right then?\nBOYS\nHi, Shake.\nSHAKE\nWere here. Normll be along in a mo with the tickets.\nHe sees GRANDFATHER.\nSHAKE\nMorning!\nWhos that little old man?\nGEORGE\nIts Pauls grandfather.\nSHAKE\nOh aye, but I thought ...\nJOHN\nNo, thats his other one.\nSHAKE\nThats all right then.\nJOHN\nClean though, isnt he?\nSHAKE\nOh yes, hes clean all right.\nNORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE.\nNORM\nMorning, lads.\nBOYS\nMorning ... Hi, Norm.\nNORM\nWell, thank God youre all got here. Now, listen, Ive had this marvellous idea ... now just for a change, lets all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Lets not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything Im going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because ...\nHe looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.\nNORM\nAre you listening to me, Lennon?\nJOHN\nYoure a swine, isnt he George?\nGEORGE\nYeah ... a swine.\nNORM\nThanks...\nHe sees the GRANDFATHER.\nNORM\nEh ... .\nBOYS IN CHORUS\n... Whos that little old man?\nNORM\nWell, who is he?\nRINGO\nHe belongs to Paul.\nNORM\nAh well, there you go. Look, Im going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?\nPAUL\nWell follow you down.\nGRANDFATHER rises.\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me coffee.\nNORM\nHe can come with Shake and me if you like.\nPAUL\nWell, look after him. I dont want to find youve lost him.\nNORM\nDont be cheeky, Ill bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.\nGRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.\nNORM\nHes very clean, isnt he?\nSHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other.\nJOHNSON\nMake up your minds, will you!\nAt last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.\nJOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a by your leave he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again.\nThe boys exchange looks as if to say ... Hello, Saucy!!\nPAUL\nDo you mind if we have it opened?\nJOHNSON\nYes, I do.\nJOHN\nYeah, but there are four of us, like, and wed like it open, if its all the same to you, that is.\nJOHNSON\nWell, it isnt. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose Ive some rights.\nRINGO\nAye, well, so have we.\nHe disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word.\nRINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio. A pop number is playing.\nJOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.\nJOHNSON\nAnd well have that thing off as well, thank you.\nRINGO\nBut I ...\nJOHNSON leans over and switches it off.\nJOHNSON\nAn elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you Im perfectly within my rights.\nHe smiles frostily.\nPAUL\nYeah, but we want to hear it and theres more of us than you. Were a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff!\nJOHNSON\nThen I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong.\nJOHN\nGies a kiss!\nPAUL\nShurrup! Look, Mister, weve paid for our seats too, you know.\nJOHNSON\nI travel on this train regularly, twice a week.\nJOHN\nKnock it off, Paul, y cant win with his sort. After all, its his train, isnt it, Mister?\nJOHNSON\nAnd dont you take that tone with me, young man!\nGEORGE\nBut...\nJOHNSON\nI fought the war for your sort.\nRINGO\nBet youre sorry you won!\nJOHNSON\nIll call the guard!\nPAUL\nAye ... but what? They dont take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Lets get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.\nThe boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous Beatle faces.\nPAUL\nEh, Mister ... can we have our ball back!\nThe man jumps to his feet.\n5.\tINTERIOR OF THE CORRIDOR\nThe boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner.\n6.\tINTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR\nFrom the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.\nThe boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside.\n7.\tINTERIOR RESTAURANT CAR\nFrom their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKEs discomfort.\nNORM\nYeah, you want to watch it.\nSHAKE\nIts not my fault.\nNORM\nWell, you stick to that story, son.\nSHAKE\nI cant help it, Im just taller than you.\nGRANDFATHER\nThey always say that.\nNORM\nYeah, well I got me eye on you.\nSHAKE\nIm sorry Norm, but I cant help being taller\nthan you.\nNORM\nWell, you dont have to rub me nose in it. Ive a good mind to ...\nJOHN\nIf youre going to have a barney Ill hold your coats.\nNORM\nHe started it.\nSHAKE\nNo, I didnt you did ...\nGEORGE\nWell, what happened?\nSHAKE\nThe old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldnt have em, all I said was aw go on, be big about it.\nPAUL\nAnd?\nNORM\nYour Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.\nPAUL\nI knew it, he started it, I should have known.\nNORM\nYwhat?\nPAUL\nYou two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat hes got you at it. Hes a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, theres your asp. Divide and Conquer, thats this ones motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.\nThe BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL.\nPAUL\nAye and well have to watch it and all.\nGEORGE\nI suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.\nNORM\nYoure right. Here you are, old devil.\nSHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.\nGRANDFATHER\nWould you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?\nPAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing.\nJOHN\nCome on lets get this coffee.\nGRANDFATHER\nBefore you go, I think its only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... dont let our Paul have his own way all the time, cos if you do he wont respect you!\nJOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAULs arms.\nGEORGE\nOh, Paul, you cant have your own way!!!\nJOHN\nIf I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?\nPAUL\nIll murder you, Grandfather!\nJOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down.\nGEORGE\nEh, look at that talent.\nThey all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.\nJOHN\nGive em a pull.\nPAUL\nShall I?\nGEORGE\nAye, but dont rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.\nPAUL\nNow whats that supposed to mean?\nGEORGE\nI dont really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didnt it?\nJOHN\nGeorge Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.\nWe follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head.\nPAUL\nExcuse me, but these young men Im sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; Id ask you meself only Im shy.\nThe two girls giggle together.\nJOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides.\nGRANDFATHER\nIm sorry, miss, but you mustnt fraternise with my prisoners.\nJEAN\nPrisoners!!\nGRANDFATHER\nConvicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of em.\nTHE BOYS\nYwhat!!!\nGRANDFATHER\nQuiet, you lot, or Ill give you a touch of me truncheon.\nThat little ones the worst. If we dont keep him on tablets he has fits.\nRINGO\nNow look here!!\nGRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGOS mouth.\nGRANDFATHER\nGet out while you can, ladies, his times\ncoming round for one of his turns.\nThe frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.\n8.\tINTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\nSHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book.\nNORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.\nNORM\nHes been gone a long time.\nSHAKE\nWho?\nNORM\nPauls grandfather.\nSHAKE\nOh, I didnt notice, whered he go?\nNORM\nDown the ... er ...\nSHAKE\nOh, down the ... er ...?\nNORM\nYeah, down the ... er ...\nSHAKE\nWell, give a couple of minutes ...\nHe resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.\n9.\tINTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\nGrandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, Im their manager, I discovered them.\nLADY AUDREY\nDid you indeed, Mr. McCartney?\nGRANDFATHER\nNow, Audrey, I told you, the names John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.\nAUDREY\nOf course, John.\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddys son of em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. Mister, can you spare us a copper? he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.\nAUDREY\nThe usual ten per cent?\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure arent there four of them?\nAUDREY\nHow fascinating. Do go on ...\n... John.\nGRANDFATHER\n... Oh, Im all heart, Maam, all heart ... Well, I let ...\n10.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\nNORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee.\nNORM\nEh, have you got Pauls grandfather?\nJOHN\nOf course, hes concealed about me person.\nNORM\nNo ... hes must have slipped off somewhere.\nPAUL\nHave you lost him?\nNORM\nDont exaggerate.\nPAUL\nYouve lost him.\nSHAKE\nPut it this way, hes mislaid him.\nPAUL\nYou cant trust you with anything, Norm, if youve lost him, Ill cripple you.\nSHAKE\nHe cant be far.\nJOHN\nI hope he fell off.\nPAUL\nDont be callous.\nRINGO\nHe doesnt like me, honest, I can tell ... Its cos Im little.\nGEORGE\nYouve got an inferiority complex, you have.\nRINGO\nYeah, I know, thats why I took up the drums. Its me active compensatory factor.\nJOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys.\n11.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\nPAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGOS P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.\nShe is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO.\nRINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her.\nHe looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: Who, me?\nTANIA smiles enthusiastically.\nGEORGE has been watching all this.\nGEORGE\nAre you going in?\nRINGO\nNo, shell only reject me in the end and Ill be frustrated.\nGEORGE\nYou never know, you might be lucky this time.\nRINGO\nNo, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.\nHe blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.\n12.\tINTERIOR FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR\nPAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.\nPAUL\nExcuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?\nThe girls jump up, surprised.\nJOHN\nWeve broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!\nEh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.\nPAUL\nWill you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...\nHe starts to drag JOHN after him.\nJOHN\nI was innocent. I was framed. I wont go back.\nJOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.\nJOHN\nI bet you can guess what I was in for.\nHe cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him.\nA waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down.\nPAUL\nHow about that one?\nHe moves towards the compartment.\nPAUL\nDid you look in here?\nGEORGE\nNo. I mean, its probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.\nPAUL\nWell, lets broaden our outlook.\nPAUL opens the door of the compartment.\n13.\tINTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT\nFrom the BOYS P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.\nGRANDFATHER\nCongratulate me, boys, Im engaged.\nPAUL enters and crosses over to him.\nPAUL\nOh no, youre not. Youve gone too far this time ... and whos paying for all this?\nGRANDFATHER\nIts all taken care of. Its down on our bill.\nPAUL\nOh, well thats all right.\nWhat?\nAUDREY\nYoung man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.\nPAUL\nIm sorry, Missus, but the betrothals off.\nIll refuse me consent, hes over-age!\nAUDREY grabs GRANDFATHERs other arm and pulls back.\nAUDREY\nLeave him alone, after all hes done for you is this the way you repay him?\nA tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.\nPAUL\nHim? hes never done anything for anybody in his life.\nAUDREY\nYou dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!\nJOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.\nJOHN\nCome on, Auntie, youre winning.\nGEORGE\nGet in there, Paul, shes weakening.\nRINGO attempts to interfere.\nRINGO\nLook, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, hes ...\nAUDREY\nKeep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.\nRINGO\nYwhat?\nShe hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.\nRINGO\nHes given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. Hes got to be stopped. Its not fair.\nRINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the womans handbag.\nA voice shouts off from outside.\nVOICE OFF\nThats one of them ... stop thief!\n14.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR\nFrom Ringos P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school.\nBoth groups are closing in on the BOYS. Theres no escape.\nRINGO\nOh Mother!!\n15.\tINTERIOR LUGGAGE VAN\nVery dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing.\nIn the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene.\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!\nPAUL\nDont dramatise.\nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.\nPAUL\nLets face it, youre lucky to be here. If theyd have had their way youd have been dropped off at Stafford already.\nGRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face.\nPAUL\nWell, youve got to admit youve upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while youre stuck in here.\nGRANDFATHER turns away again.\nPAUL\nAll right, how about Ringo? I mean ... hes very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audreys concerned, shes finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...\nGRANDFATHER\nA harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.\nPAUL\nOh, its all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?\nGRANDFATHER\nYoure left-handed, arent you, Paul?\nPAUL\nYeah ... so what?\nGRANDFATHER\nWhy do you always use your left hand?\nPAUL\nWell, dont be daft, Ive got to.\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd I take a left-handed view of life, Ive got to.\nPAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of\nthe luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.\nPAUL\nShove up!\nGRANDFATHER produces a penny.\nGRANDFATHER\nOdds or evens?\nPAUL sighs.\nPAUL\nOdds.\nGRANDFATHER flips the coin.\nThe guards van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.\nJOHN\nDont worry, son, well get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.\nPAUL\nOh, its a laugh a line with Lennon.\nAnyroad up ... Its all your fault.\nRINGO\nMe? Why?\nGEORGE\nBag-snatcher.\nGRANDFATHER\nThats right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.\nJOHN\nEvery morning.\nJOHN has been looking around the guards van.\nJOHN\nGaw, its depressing in here, isnt it? Funny...\ncos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, dont they? Youd expect something a little more palatial.\nCome on. Lets have a little action. Lets do something, then.\nPAUL\nLike what?\nJOHN\nWell, Ive got me gob stopper.\nLook, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.\nAnd to RINGOs beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene.\n16.\tEXTERIOR TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE \nWhile the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London.\n17.\tEXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS \nSHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.\n18.\tINTERIOR GUARDS VAN\nBy the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.\nNORM enters the guards van.\nNORM\nDont move, any of you. Theyve gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.\nJOHN\nPlease, can I have one to surge with?\nNORM\nNo.\nJOHN\nAh, go on, you swine.\nNORM\nNo, you cant. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car thats waiting.\nHe points and we see a big car parked across the road.\nThe BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door.\n19.\tEXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS\nJust as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.\nNORM\nOh no!\nGRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, lads, follow me.\nAnd before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls.\nJOHN\nVive lamour!\nNORM drags him away.\n20.\tEXTERIOR RAILWAY STATION\nThe BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car.\nThe BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfathers taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.\n21.\tINTERIOR BIG CAR\nNORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.\nNORM\nGo like the clappers, son!\nFRANK\nThat was my entire intention, sir.\n22.\tEXTERIOR STATION\nThe car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off.\nIt moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins.\n23.\tINTERIOR HOTEL SUITE NIGHT\nThere is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats.\nRINGO\nI dont snore.\nGEORGE\nYou do - repeatedly.\nRINGO\nDo I snore?\nJOHN\nYoure a window rattler, son.\nRINGO\nWell, thats just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?\nPAUL\nWith a trombone hooter like yours itd be unnatural if you didnt.\nGRANDFATHER\nDont mock the afflicted, Pauly.\nPAUL\nOh for Petes sake, Its only a joke.\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, it may be a joke, but its his nose. He cant help having a horrible great nose, its the only one hes got. And his poor little heads trembling under the weight of it.\nNORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror.\nNORM\nPaul, John, George - get at it.\nJOHN\nHello the income tax have caught up with us at last.\nPAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it.\nRINGO\nNone for me, then?\nNORM\nSorry.\nJohn hands RINGO a single envelope.\nJOHN\nThatll keep you busy.\nGRANDFATHER\nIts your nose, ysee. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. Theyll pick on a nose...\nRINGO\nYou go and pick on your own.\nSHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together.\nJOHN\nIs that yours?\nSHAKE\nFor Ringo.\nHe dumps it in Ringos arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up.\nJOHN\nThat must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.\nGEORGE\nHe comes from a large family.\nRINGO\nWell.\nRINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card.\nRINGO\nEh, whats Boyds Club?\nThe lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads.\nPAUL\nThe Management of Boyds takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr Richard Starkey--thats you--in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet. Blimey!\nRINGO\nAnd they want me?\nJOHN\nOh, its got round that youre a heavy punter.\nNORM\nWell youre not going.\nRINGO\nAh.\nGRANDFATHER\nQuite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!\nHe pockets the card himself.\nRINGO\nThats mine.\nNORM\nHave done, and you lot get your pens out.\nBOYS\nWhy?\nNORM\nIts homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot\nall answered tonight.\nThe BOYS all protest.\nNORM\nIll brook no denial!\nJOHN\nIts all right for you, you couldnt get a pen in your foot, you swine.\nNORM\nCome on, Shake, well leave em to their\npenmanship.\nHe goes followed by SHAKE.\nThere is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.\nJOHN\nWhile the swines away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for?\nWith a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door.\nGRANDFATHER\nWhat about all these letters?\nBOYS\nRead em!\nThey disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringos card.\nC.U. GRANDFATHER\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd a free champagne buffet.\nHe grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiters suit.\n24.\tINTERIOR DANCING CLUB NIGHT\nThe club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement\nby all the other customers. During this scene we\nCUT AWAY\n25.\tINTERIOR BOYDS CLUB NIGHT\nThe whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur suivez and banco to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.\nDEALER\nAlors, Msieur?\nGRANDFATHER\nSouflée.\nHe turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.\nGRANDFATHER\nI bet youre a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!\nCROUPIER\nPas Bingo, Msieur... Banco.\nGRANDFATHER\nIll take the little darlings anyway.\nHe takes up the cards and cant understand that they are unnumbered.\nGRANDFATHER\nTwo and one is three, carry one is four.\nThe buxom BLONDE leans over him.\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\nGRANDFATHER\nEh?\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\nGRANDFATHER\nWed be thrown out.\nBLONDE\nYour cards... lay them down... face up.\nHe does so.\nCROUPIER\nHuit à la pointe... et sept.\nBLONDE\nYou had a lovely little pair, ysee.\nGRANDFATHER\nI did?\nCROUPIER taps impatiently on box .\nBLONDE\nTheyre yours.\nGRANDFATHER\nThey are?\nBLONDE\nThe cards... youre bank.\n26.\tINTERIOR DANCING CLUB\nThe BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving.\n27.\tINTERIOR BOYDS CLUB\nGRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players.\nGRANDFATHER\nBingo!\nCROUPIER\nMlord dit Bingo.\nWAITER\nA little light refreshment.\nGRANDFATHER\nA glass of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldnt go amiss.\nSouflée, chop chop.\nThe CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray.\n28.\tINTERIOR DANCING CLUB\nThe BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze.\nFrom their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out.\n29.\tINTERIOR BOYDS\nGRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing.\n30.\tINTERIOR HOTEL ROOM\nWaiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says The manager! and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying:\nNORM\nNow get on with it.\nJOHN\nWe were going to do it.\nNORM\nAye, well, now!\nRINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest.\nRINGO\nAny of you lot put a man in that cupboard?\nALL\nA man? No.\nRINGO\nWell somebody did.\nGEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group.\nGEORGE\nHes right, yknow.\nBOYS\nAh well, there you go.\nSHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out.\nSHAKE\nEh, whats all this?\nPAUL\nOh, him... Hes been lurking.\nJOHN\nAye, he looks a right lurker.\nSHAKE\nYoure undressed. Where are your clothes?\nWAITER\nThe old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyds.\nPAUL\nNo!\nRINGO\nOh, hes gone to my club, has he?\nPAUL\nYeah, Its all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. Hes probably in the middle of an orgy by now.\nJOHN\nWell, what are we waiting for?\nSHAKE\nAye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours\nis worse than any of you lot.\n31.\tINTERIOR BOYDS\nGRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.\nWAITER\nEncore de champagne, Monsieur?\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, and Ill have some more champagne as well.\nHe takes another swig of his glass.\nMANAGER\nLord John McCartney, hes the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.\nCUSTOMER\nOh I dont know, looks rather clean to me.\nThe MANAGER comes to grandfathers side.\nMANAGER\nPlay is about to resume, mlord.\nGRANDFATHER\nLead me to it, Ive a winning itch that only success can pacify.\nHe takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk.\n32.\tINTERIOR RECEPTION DESK BOYDS CLUB\nJOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance.\nATTENDANT\nIm sorry sir, members and invited guests only.\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN\nIve got to get in.\nIts urgent and important.\nIve had an invite.\nTake me to your leader.\nNORM\nShurrup.\nThe BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room.\nNORM\nAll we want to know is have you got a little\nold man in there?\nMANAGER\nDo you mean Lord McCartney?\nCLOSE-UP PAUL\nPAUL\nHes at it again. Look, Im his grandfather... I mean...\nBLONDE\nOh, it must be the dolly floor show.\nJOHN\nStay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.\nGRANDFATHER\nWho are these ruffians?... Ive never seen them before in my life! ... \nThey grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the\nentrance desk. They then go to settle up.\nMANAGER\nBefore you go, gentlemen, theres the small matter of the bill.\nHe snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.\nNORM\nIll settle that.\nHe glances at it.\nNORM\nA hundred and eighty pounds!\nMANAGER\nI beg your pardon, guineas.\nAt that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes.\nWAITER\nYour winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety\npounds.\nThe MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money.\nGRANDFATHER\nHow about me change?\nMANAGER\nCloak room charge.\nHe hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh.\nRINGO\nAh well, easy come, easy go.\nThe others glower at him.\nRINGO\nWell.\n33.\tINTERIOR BIG CAR \nThe BOYS have settled down.\nJOHN\nShould I say it?\nGEORGE\nFollow your impulse.\nRINGO\nItll only get you into trouble.\nJOHN\nAah, shurrup, misery!\nJOHN slouches forward.\nJOHN\nO.K. Driver, follow that car!!\nThe driver is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform.\nFRANK\nWould you like to be a little more precise, sir?\nJOHN\nWell, thats the wrong line for a start.\nFRANK\nSorry?\nGEORGE\nOh, dont pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.\nFRANK\nI see.\nJOHN\nYeah, you know, O.K. Buster, follow that car, theres a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!\nFRANK\nOh, yes, now Im with you.\nBut, gee, Mister, Ive got my license to think of ... were doing a hundred now ...\nThe car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet.\nJOHN\nEver seen one of these before?\nFRANK\nAh ... a shamus, eh?\nJOHN\nI see you go to the night court.\nFRANK\nIve made the scene.\nJOHN\nWell, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.\nGEORGE\nI dont think that bits right.\nJOHN\nWhat do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?\n34.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nAs the big car overtakes a Company Directors Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the button of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the button and the window rises.\nRINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill . PAUL, then, using his coat as a matadors cloak, does a butterfly pass at the car which\nhas just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position.\n35.\tINTERIOR CAR\nNORM\nWill you all stop it, youre like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.\nJOHN\nWell, you shouldnt have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.\nFRANK\nWere nearly there, sir.\nJOHN\nEh ... dont call him sir, hes got enough delusions of power as it is.\nCLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM.\nNORM\nAnd I was happy in the bakery. Ill never know\nwhy I left.\n36.\tEXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE\nWhich has been converted to the T.V. studios.\nThere are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchmans canvas hut and brazier.\nThe car approaches.\n37.\tINTERIOR OF THE CAR\nNORM\nGet ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.\nJOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchmans canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment.\nAt the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.\n38.\tINTERIOR STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\nAs the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars\nand old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\nPress conference, theyre waiting for you.\nNORM\nGive us a couple of shakes to get our breath.\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\nTheyre waiting now!\nAnd without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.\nPAUL\nEh this lot means it. Theyre even taking\nhostages.\nThe BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.\n39.\tINTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM\nIt is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them..\nNow begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS.\nEvery time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place:\nSOUND REPORTER\nWhats your philosophy of life?\nJOHN\nIm torn between Zen and Im all right, Jack.\nREPORTER\nHas success changed your life?\nRINGO\nYes.\nREPORTER\nDo you like playing the guitar?\nGEORGE\nNext to kissing girls its favourites.\nPAUL is surrounded by newspapermen.\nPAUL\nNo, actually, were just good friends.\nHIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.\n40.\tINTERIOR THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE\nThe BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.\nPAUL\nAnything to spare?\nGRANDFATHER\nWeve just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.\nGEORGE\nSure.\n.\nPAUL\nAh well. Eh, look!\nHe points, and from PAULS P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.\nPAUL\nLets go and muck in.\nJOHN\nAye, before anyone stops us.\nThey exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.\n41.\tINTERIOR STAGE\nEveryone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out:\nVOICE\nHere, what about these electric guitars?\nSHAKE\nWhere are they?\nVOICE\nBack here, mate.\nSHAKE\nIm coming.\nRINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.\nRINGO\nLeave them drums alone.\nFLOOR MANAGER\nOh, surely one can have a tiny touch.\nRINGO\nIf you so much as breathe heavy on them, Im\nout on strike.\nFLOOR MANAGER\nArent you being rather arbitrary?\nRINGO\nThats right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I dont go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?\nFLOOR MANAGER\nSpoil sport!\nRINGO\nWell!\nRINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious.\nGEORGE\nHes very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.\nRINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over.\nPAUL\nWhats up?\nGEORGE\nHes sulking again.\nJOHN\nIll show him.\nHe picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAULS encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.\n42.\tINTERIOR RAMP\nAs the number finishes a baldheaded man storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle.\nDIRECTOR\nAll right Im sorry and lets hear no more about it. If thats your opinion, youre probably right. Look, if you think Im unsuitable lets have it out in the open, I cant stand these back-stage politics.\nBy the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride.\nJOHN\nArent you tending to black and white this whole situation?\nDIRECTOR\nWell, quite honestly I wasnt expecting a musical arranger who would question my ability ... picture-wise.\nJOHN\nI could listen to him for hours.\nPAUL\nHeave to, whats all this about a musical arranger?\nDIRECTOR\nMr. McCartney Senior!\nThe BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.\nGRANDFATHER\nHey Pauly, theyre trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but Ive given him the test.\nDIRECTOR\nIm quite happy to be replaced.\nGRANDFATHER\nHes a typical buck-passer.\nDIRECTOR\nI won an award.\nJOHN\nA likely story.\nDIRECTOR\nIts on the wall in my office.\nAt this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene.\nNORM\nHello our lot, everyone happy?\nThe BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently.\nNORM\nAll right, all right. If you dont need this lot, Ill lock em up in the dressing room till you do.\nDIRECTOR\nPlease do, Ill not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.\nHe glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.\nDIRECTOR\nGive me a bottle of milk and a packet of\nOblivion. Oh, its a plot, I see it now, its\nall a plot.\nThey go left towards the back-stage.\nNORM\nNow, come on, Ive got the key.\nHe leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely.\nNORM and the BOYS turn on him.\nNORM\nLets have you.\nJOHN\nCome on speedy!\nPAUL\nRingo!\nGEORGE\nWake up!\nRINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves. The BOYS pass him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.\nGRANDFATHER\nI cant tell you how much Ive enjoyed your act.\nHe slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the mans coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out 10 on his sign, and writes 9 in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performers smile as he does.\n43.\tINTERIOR THEATRE BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR\nThe BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor.\nJOHN\nGear costume!\nACTOR\nSwap?\nNORM\nRight, first floor and no messing about.\nNORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, after you, No, after you. NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.\nNORM\nLennon, leave them girls alone or Ill report you.\nThe BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded by people.\n44.\tINTERIOR DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR\nRINGOS attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.\n45.\tEXTERIOR TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE\nFrom the BOYS P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways.\nThe BOYS scamper down the fire escape.\nWhen they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through.\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.\nIt is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.\nThey look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHNS cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.\nThe four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass.\nMANS VOICE\nI suppose you know this is private property.\nThe boys freeze.\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big mans eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man.\nJOHN\nSorry if we hurt your field, Mister.\n46.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR BACK-STAGE\nGRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm.\n47.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE UNDERNEATH THE STAGE\nUnder the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestras entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.\nThe menacing shadows appear on the stairway.\nNORM \nTheres no one here.\nSHAKE \nThis is the only way they could have gone.\nWe now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.\n48.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE\nA rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.\nBack now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each others arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.\n48A.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM\nJOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other.\nMILLIE\nHello.\nJOHN\nHello.\nMILLIE\nOh, wait a minute, dont tell me youre ...\nJOHN\nNo, not me.\nMILLIE\nOh you are, I know you are.\nJOHN\nNo, Im not.\nMILLIE\nYou are.\nJOHN\nIm not, no.\nMILLIE\nWell, you look like him.\nJOHN\nOh do I? Youre the first one who ever said that.\nMILLIE\nOh you do, look.\nJOHN looks at himself in the mirror.\nJOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.\nJOHN\nMy eyes are lighter.\nMILLIE\nOh yes.\nJOHN\nAnd my nose...\nMILLIE\nWell, yes your nose is. Very.\nJOHN\nIs it?\nMILLIE\nI would have said so.\nJOHN\nAye, but you know him well.\nMILLIE\nNo I dont, hes only a casual acquaintance.\nJOHN\nThats what you tell me.\nMILLIE\nWhat have you heard?\nJOHN\nIts all over the place, everyone knows.\nMILLIE\nIs it? Is it really?\nJOHN\nMind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldnt have it.\nMILLIE\nI knew I could rely on you.\nJOHN\nThanks.\nMILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns.\nMILLIE\nYou dont look like him at all.\nJOHN winks at her and she winks back.\n49.\tINTERIOR DRESSING ROOM\nNORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS TAILOR is there waiting for the BOYS.\nSHAKE\nOh theyve probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.\nNORM\nThats too easy for Lennon.\nHe crosses to door leading to fire escape.\nNORM\nHes out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.\nSHAKE\nYoure imagining it. Youre letting things prey on your mind.\nNORM\nOh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.\nSHAKE\nBut John hasnt got any.\nNORM\nWhat?\nSHAKE\nNerves.\nNORM\nI know, thats the trouble.\nHe puffs nervously at his cigarette.\nNORM\nOh, Ive toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but hed only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.\nHe hears something.\nNORM\nGet behind that door, theyre coming. Someones coming. Quick, hide!\nThe two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.\nJOHN\nWhat are you doing there?\nSHAKE\nHiding.\nJOHN\nI think youre soft or something.\nNORM\nWe werent hiding.\nTAILOR\nNow?\nNORM\nNow. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here?\nRINGO\nWell ...\nNORM\nWhen I tell you to stay put, stay put.\nJOHN\nDont cane me, sir, I was led astray.\nNORM\nOh shurrup and come on John. Theyre waiting\nfor you in the studio.\nRINGO\nOh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.\nNORM\nGood lad, Ringo.\nPAUL\nOh, listen to teachers pet.\nGEORGE\nYou crawler.\nJOHN\nHes betrayed the class.\nRINGO\nOh, leave off!!!\nJOHN\nTemper! Temper!\nRINGO\nWell ...\nCLOSE-UP on NORMs long suffering face.\nNORM\nWill you all get a move on! Theyre waiting for\nyou!\nBy this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGEs shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.\nJOHN\nI now declare this bridge open.\nThe BOYS run out the door.\n50.\tINTERIOR BACKSTAGE AREA\nFive beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling acts music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.\nFrom the door off stage, above which is a sign To Canteen and Production Offices, GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and\nthree. He goes to be measured with the sweater.\nFrom the onstage area, a jugglers ASSISTANT in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.\nWe CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHERs. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.\nWe hear the DIRECTORs voice.\nDIRECTOR \nAll right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and well carry on with the next act.\nWe\nCUT TO\ncentre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.\nThe FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.\nWe CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTORs VOICE.\n51.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\nCLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.\nDIRECTOR\nWhere are they? I said, where are they? Where are they?\nFLOOR MANAGER\nTheyre coming, I promise you.\nDIRECTOR\nNow look, if theyre not here on this floor in thirty seconds theres going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!!\nTwo STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR.\n1st STAGE HAND\nWhats he on about, Taff?\nWELSH STAGE HAND\nWell ... hes being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind.\nAt this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play.\nJOHN\nStanding about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, dont they?\nThe director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens.\nDIRECTOR\nOf course, once youre over thirty, youre finished. Its a young mans medium and I just cant take the pace.\nRINGO\nAre you as young as that, then?\nBOYS\nShurrup!\nGRANDFATHER\nIsnt it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.\nPAUL\nShove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?\nSHAKE\nIm an electrician, not a wet nurse, yknow.\nPAUL\nIll set John on you!\nSHAKE\nOh, anything you say, Paul.\nHe leads GRANDFATHER away.\nThe BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHNS head. JOHN starts attacking it.\nDIRECTORS VOICE \nRun through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions.\nThe BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. When theyve finished, they stand about spare.\n52.\tINTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM\nThe room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.\nDIRECTOR\nThat was more or less all right for me. Ill give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ...\nOh how about make-up?\nMAKE-UP WOMAN\nNot really, they dont need it any. Well just powder them off for shine.\nDIRECTOR\nGood. Norm, get them along to make-up will you?\nNORM\nSure.\nDIRECTOR\nAnd hurry, theyre not looking too happy.\nFrom the directors P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio.\n53.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\nPAUL\nWhats the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.\nRINGO\nYou were twanging too loud.\nJOHN\nHowd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?\nGEORGE\nYoure getting out of hand. I dont know whats come over you today.\nRINGO\nThats right. Its always me, isnt it?\nJOHN\nSince you ask, yes.\nAah, come on, Ring, we love you.\nHe puts his arm around Ringos shoulder.\nRINGO\nWell!\nJOHN\nHell get over it.\nNORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.\nNORM\nAll right, our lot, make-up.\n54.\tINTERIOR MAKE UP ROOM\nA smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girls name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.\nSHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out.\nSHAKE\nYou blinked!\nGRANDFATHER\nI never did, you did.\nThe BOYS enter.\nSHAKE\nHello, hes not talking to me. Hes having a sulk.\nGEORGE\nWell, it must be catching. Hes given it to the\nchamp here.\nHe indicates RINGO who ignores him.\nNORM\nStop picking on him.\nRINGO\nI dont need you to defend me, yknow, Norm.\nJOHN\nLeave him alone, hes got swine fever.\nNORM\nSit down, the lot of you.\nAt this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellingtons army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up.\nNow a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of aye ayes and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things.\nHEAD MAKE UP GIRL\nOh, this is impossible! Well never get you all done in time.\nACTOR\nWell, youll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether theyre made up or not.\nAnd whos me, then?\nJOHN\nMy names Betty...\nDo you want a punch up your frogged tunic?\nNORM fights his way to JOHN.\nNORM\nNow listen, John, behave yourself or Ill murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.\nSHAKE has a long blond girls wig on. With the assistance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsmans busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of Queen Magazine.\nNORM\nWhat do you think are youre up to?\nRINGO\nSomeone put it on me.\nJOHN\nExcuses, thats all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.\nThe GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off.\nJOHN\nYou wont interfere with the basic rugged\nconcept of my personality, will you, girl?\nPAUL\nEh, dont take out me lines.\nGEORGE\nYeah, they give him that Je ne sais quoi\nrakish air.\nThe lads laugh with pleasure.\nRINGO decides to try a little joke.\nRINGO\n(indicating the busby he is still\nwearing)\nShort back and sides, please.\nThe other look at him with mock disgust.\nPAUL\nBehave...\nJOHN\nForeign devil ...\nGEORGE\nControl yourself...\nGRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.\nGRANDFATHER\nIn my considered opinion youre a bunch of sissies.\nJOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.\nJOHN\nYou know youre only jealous!\nAnd dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHERs annoyance.\nNORM\nLeave him alone, Lennon, or Ill tell them all the truth about you.\nJOHN\nYou wouldnt!\nNORM\nI would though.\nNORM goes out.\nPAUL\nWhats he know?\nJOHN\nNothing, hes trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, hes a swine but a clever swine, mind.\nGRANDFATHER\nLookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far Ive seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, thats maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but Im feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. Im a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.\nGIRL\nWhat a clean old man.\nGRANDFATHER\nYoure too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so dont press your luck.\nJOHN\nHes sex-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin.\nNORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio.\nNORM\nTheyre nearly ready for you. Theyre just finishing the band call.\nJOHN\nGear! Come on, girls, lets have a bit of a dance.\nJOHNS GIRL\nI dont think its allowed.\nJOHN\nWell ... it wouldnt be any fun if it was!\nThe BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio.\nThe GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.\nAs the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the Strauss singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut.\nJOHN\nNever.\nDuring dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath.\n55.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\nThe work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.\n56.\tINTERIOR CONTROL ROOM\nThe whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.\nWe now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.\nSo we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.\nWhen the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.\n57.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\nDIRECTORS VOICE OVER TANNOY\nThank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show.\nThe boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll.\nNORM is on them at once.\nNORM\nThat was great, youve got about an hour but dont leave the theatre.\nJOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer.\nJOHN\nShes going to show me her stamp collection.\nPAUL\nSos mine.\nNORM\nJohn, Im talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.\nJOHN\nOink! Oink!\nThey dash off with the two beauties.\nGRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me cup of tea.\nNORM\nShake.\nSHAKE\nIm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.\nNORM\nClever.\nGeorge.\nBut GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.\nNORM turns to RINGO.\nNORM\nLook after him.\nRINGO\nBut...\nNORM\nDo I have to raise me voice?\nRINGO\nOh, all right. Come here, Grandad.\nAnd the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.\n57A.\tINTERIOR BACKSTAGE\nA man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.\nGRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.\nWe\nCUT TO\nTHE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.\n58.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN\nThe canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHERs eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.\nGRANDFATHER\nWill you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!\nRINGO\nWell ... whats the matter with that?\nGRANDFATHER\nHave you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?\nRINGO\nYou can learn from books.\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you now? Aah ... sheeps heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.\nRINGO\nOut where?\nGRANDFATHER\nAny old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When youre not thumping them pagan skins, youre tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!\nRINGO\nBooks are good!\nGRANDFATHER\nParadings better!\nRINGO\nParading?\nGRANDFATHER\nThats it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!\nRINGO\nWell, I am living, arent I?\nGRANDFATHER\nYoure living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?\nRINGO\nEh ... youre a bit old for that sort of chat, arent you?\nGRANDFATHER\nAt least Ive a backlog of memories, but all youve got is that book!\nRINGO\nAaah ... stop picking on me... youre as bad as the rest of them.\nGRANDFATHER\nSo you are a man after all.\nRINGO\nWhats that mean?\nGRANDFATHER\nDo you think I havent noticed ... do you think I wasnt aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, theyve driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.\nRINGO\nOh ... I dunno.\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd that lots never happier than when theyre jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, Id like to know.\nRINGO\nYeah ... thats right.\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd whats it all come to in the end?\nRINGO\nYeah ... whats in it for me?\nGRANDFATHER\nA book!\nRINGO\nYeah ... a bloomin book!\nHe throws the book down.\nGRANDFATHER\nWhen you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before youre too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to lifes goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioners a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.\nRINGO\nYeah ... funny really, cos Id never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesnt it?\nGRANDFATHER\nYoure only right.\nRINGO\nIm not wrong.\nThere is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.\nGRANDFATHER\nWhere are you off to?\nRINGO\nIm going parading before its too late!\nRINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried.\n59.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY\nRINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.\nGEORGE\nEh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?\nRINGO\nNo. I dont.\nAs he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE.\nRINGO\nYou want to stop being so scornful, its twisting your face.\n60.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMANS OFFICE\nJOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.\nJOHN\nHere he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.\nRINGO looks at JOHN hard.\nPAUL\nEh. I thought you were looking after the old man.\nRINGO\nGet knotted!\nPAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street.\nPAUL\nWeve got only half an hour till the final run-through. He cant walk out on us.\nJOHN\nCant he? Hes done it, son!\nGEORGE runs towards them.\nGEORGE\nEh, I dont know if you realise it, but ...\nPAUL\nWe do.\nGEORGE\nYes. Your grandfathers stirred him up.\nPAUL\nHe hasnt.\nGEORGE\nYes, hes filled his head with notions seemingly.\nPAUL\nThe old mixer, come on well have to put him right.\nThe three of them go into the street.\n61.\tEXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\nThe boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared.\nPAUL\nWell split up and search for him, he cant be far.\nThey now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way.\nJOHN\nIts happened at last, weve become a limited company.\nGEORGE\nIll look in here again.\nPAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways.\n62.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nRINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying We Buy Anything and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who dont recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him.\nRINGO\nHello.\nGIRL\nGet out of it, short house!\nCLOSE-UP on Ringos secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road.\n63.\tEXTERIOR TOW PATH CANAL\nRINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesnt budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.\nPOLICEMAN\nAint you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.\nBefore RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.\nRINGO\nSoutherner!\nHe looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO.\nBOY\nHere, mate, thats my hoop, stop playing with it.\nRINGO\nHoop, this isnt a hoop, its a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?\nBOY\nOh dont be so stroppy!\nRINGO\nWell! A boy of your age bowling hoop at people. How old are you anyway?\nBOY\nNine.\nRINGO\nBet youre only eight and a half.\nBOY\nEight and two thirds.\nRINGO\nWell, there you are and watch it with that hoop.\nBOY\nGerron out of it, youre only jealous cause youre old.\nRINGO\nShurrup!\nBOY\nI bet youre\n-- sixteen!\nRINGO\nFifteen and two thirds, actually.\nBOY\nWell --\nRINGO\nAll right, take your hoop and bowl.\nHe moves off and the BOY follows.\nBOY\nOh you can have it, Im packing it in -- it depresses me.\nRINGO\nYwhat?\nBOY\nYou heard, it gets on my wick.\nRINGO\nWell thats lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why arent you at school?\nBOY\nIm a deserter.\nRINGO\nAre you now?\nBOY\nYeah, Ive blown school out.\nRINGO\nJust you?\nBOY\nNo, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.\nRINGO\nDing Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?\nBOY\nYeah, thats right, they was supposed to come\nwith us but they chickened.\nRINGO\nYeah? And theyre your mates are they?\nBOY\nYeah.\nRINGO\nNot much cop without em, is it?\nBOY\nOh, its all right.\nRINGO\nYeah?\nBOY\nYeah.\nRINGO\nWhat they like?\nBOY is glad to have something to talk about.\nBOY\nGingers mad, he says things all the time and Eddys good at punching and spitting.\nRINGO\nHow about Ding Dong?\nBOY\nHes a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know its all right cos hes one of the gang.\nRINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.\nBOY\nWhy arent you at work?\nRINGO\nIm a deserter, too.\nBOY\nOh.\nAt this moment a childs voice shouts out Charley and from RINGOS P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly.\nBOY\nSee you.\nThe BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.\n64.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE\nGEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying Canteen and Production Office Opposite. He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters building.\n65.\tINTERIOR OFFICE\nIt is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once.\nSECRETARY\nOh, there you are!\nGEORGE\nOh, Im sorry, I must have made a mistake.\nSECRETARY\nYou havent, youre just late.\nOh, yes, hes going to be very pleased with you.\nGEORGE\nIs he?\nSECRETARY\nYes, youre quite a feather in the cap.\nHello, Ive got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.\nOf course, right away.\nShe crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it.\nSECRETARY\nWell ... come on.\nGEORGE\nSorry.\nHe follows her quickly in.\n66.\tINTERIOR THE INNER OFFICE\nA large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queens magazine decor.\nBehind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal.\nSECRETARY\nWill this do, Simon?\nSIMON\nNot bad, dolly, not really bad.\nTurn around, chicky baby.\nGEORGE does so.\nSIMON\nOh yes, a definite poss. Hell look good alongside Susan.\nAll right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Dont breathe on me, Adrian.\nADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.\nGEORGE\nLook, Im terribly sorry but Im afraid theres been some sort of a misunderstanding.\nSIMON\nOh, you can come off it with us. You dont have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.\nGEORGE\nIm afraid I dont understand.\nSIMON\nOh, my God, hes a natural.\nSECRETARY \nWell, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.\nSIMON\nThey ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still hes a good type.\nHe now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots.\nSIMON\nWe want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.\nGEORGE\nOh, by all means, Id be quite prepared for that eventuality.\nSIMON\nWell, not your real opinion, naturally. Itll be written out and youll learn it.\nCan he read?\nGEORGE\nOf course I can.\nSIMON\nI mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?\nGEORGE\nIll have a bash.\nSIMON\nGood. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?\nGEORGE\nTa.\nSIMON\nWell, at least hes polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.\nA collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.\nSIMON\nNow, youll like these. You really dig them. Theyre fab and all the other pimply hyperboles.\nGEORGE\nI wouldnt be seen dead in them. Theyre dead grotty.\nSIMON\nGrotty?\nGEORGE\nYeah, grotesque.\nSIMON\nMake a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think its rather touching really. Heres this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks hell be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isnt wearing one of these nasty things. Of course theyre grotty, you wretched nit, thats why they were designed, but thats what youll want.\nGEORGE\nBut I wont.\nSIMON\nYou can be replaced you know, chicky baby.\nGEORGE\nI dont care.\nSIMON\nAnd that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you wont meet Susan if you dont cooperate.\nGEORGE\nAnd whos this Susan when shes at home?\nSIMON\nOnly Susan Campey, our resident teenager. Youll have to love her. Shes your symbol.\nGEORGE\nOh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?\nSIMON\nI beg your pardon?\nGEORGE\nOh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.\nSIMON\nShes a trend setter. Its her profession!\nGEORGE\nShes a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.\nSIMON\nGet him out of here!!\nGEORGE\nHave I said something amiss?\nSIMON\nGet him out of here. Hes knocking the programmes image!!\nThe underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.\nGEORGE\nSorry about the shirts.\nHe is ejected through the door.\nSIMON\nGet him out.\nYou dont think hes a new phenomenon, do you?\nSECRETARY\nYou mean an early clue to the new direction?\nSIMON\nWheres the calendar?\nNo, hes just a trouble maker. The change isnt due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susans contract. Lets not take any unnecessary chances!\n67.\tEXTERIOR STREET PUB ON THE CORNER\nThe sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.\n68.\tINTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM\nThe atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.\nGRANDFATHER\nIm sorry lads, I didnt mean it, honest.\nDIRECTOR\nIf he says that again, Ill strike him.\nSHAKE\nTheyll be back, theyre good lads, theyll be back.\nDIRECTOR\nYes? Well theyve got only ten minutes to the final run-through.\nGRANDFATHER\nI meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.\nNORM\nGod knows what youve unleashed on the unsuspecting South. Itll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once hes got the taste for it.\n69.\tINT. PUB PUBLIC BAR\nCLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his hand.\nBARMAID\nThat was fresh this morning.\nWe now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, theyve an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.\nNear the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby.\nBARMAID\nThatll be two and nine...\nRINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringos glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs\naway, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.\nBARMAID\nRight ... On your way!\nRINGO\nYwhat?\nBARMAID\nYou heard, on your way, troublemaker!\nNow the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ...\n70.\tEXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE PUB\nRINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious.\n71.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nPAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, TV Rehearsal Room. As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.\n72.\tINTERIOR HALL\nPAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.\n73.\tINTERIOR REHEARSAL ROOM\nPAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming.\nGIRL\nIf I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problems Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.\nShe dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.\nGIRL\nOh!\nPAUL\nWell ... go head, do the next bit.\nGIRL\nGo away! Youve spoilt it.\nPAUL\nOh, sorry I spoke.\nHe makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.\nGIRL\nAre you supposed to be here?\nPAUL\nIve got you worried, havent I?\nGIRL\nIm warning you, theyll be back in a minute.\nPAUL\nDyou know something, They dont worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... thats all but if it worries you ... well ...\nGIRL\nYoure from Liverpool, arent you?\nPAUL\nHowd you guess?\nGIRL\nOh, its the way you talk.\nPAUL\nIs it ... is it, really?\nGIRL\nAre you pulling my leg?\nPAUL\nSomething like that.\nGIRL\nI see.\nDo you like the play?\nPAUL\nYeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.\nYeah, its gear on a girl.\nGIRL\nGear?\nPAUL\nAye, the big hammer, smashing!\nGIRL\nThank you.\nPAUL\nDont mench ... well, why dont you give us a few more lines, like?\nGIRL pouts.\nPAUL\nYou dont half slam the door in peoples faces, do you? I mean, what about when youre playing the part, like, hundreds of peoplell see you and ...\nGIRL\nIm not ...\nPAUL\nOh, youre the understudy, sort of thing?\nGIRL\nNo.\nIm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.\nPAUL\nOh, I see. You are an actress though, arent you?\nGIRL\nYes.\nPAUL\nAye, I knew you were.\nGIRL\nWhats that mean?\nPAUL\nWell, the way you were spouting, like ....\nI dont believe you, sir... and all that. Yeah, it was gear.\nGIRL\nThe big hammer?\nPAUL\nOh aye, a sledge.\nGIRL\nBut the way you did it then sounded so phony.\nPAUL\nNo ... I wouldnt say that ... just like an actress ... you know.\nHe moves and stands about like an actress.\nGIRL\nBut thats not like a real person at all.\nPAUL\nAye well, actresses arent like real people, are they?\nGIRL\nThey ought to be.\nPAUL\nOh, I dont know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?\nGIRL\nWhat are you?\nPAUL\nIm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.\nGIRL\nI bet you dont sound like real people.\nPAUL\nWe do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. Its fab.\nGIRL\nIs it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?\nPAUL\nWhat of? Look, I wouldnt do it unless I was. Im dead lucky cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.\nHe laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio\nPAUL\n... all this and a jam butty too!!\nGIRL\nI only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.\nPAUL\nWhy? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?\nGIRL\nWhy selfish?\nPAUL\nWell, youve got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.\nShe looks at him in surprise.\nPAUL\nNo, hang on, Ive not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When Id done she said to me, Go and give some to the other kids. So, I said I would but I thought to meself, She must think Im soft. Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didnt nmind, mind, cos Id made the stuff in the first place. Well ... thats why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?\nGIRL\nNot really but Im probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?\nPAUL\nWell, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, shes a bit of a scrubber, isnt she?\nGIRL\nIs she?\nPAUL\nOf course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...\nEh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, its got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Ywhat? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly its love and were stopping in an empty shop doorway. Youre just after me body and ycant have it ... so there!!\nGIRL\nAnd you honestly think thats what she meant?\nPAUL\nOh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, shes trying to get him to marry her but he doesnt want ... well ... I dont reckon any fellas ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. Youve got to laugh.\nHe laughs.\nGIRL\nWell, its nice to know you think were clever.\nPAUL\nAnd cunning.\nGIRL\nAnd what do you do about it?\nPAUL\nMe? Oh, I dont have the time, Im always running about with the lads ... no, we dont have the time.\nGIRL\nPity.\nPAUL\nAye, it is but as long as you get by, its all right, you know ... bash on, happy valleys when they let you stop. Anyroad, Id better get back.\nGIRL\nYes.\nPAUL\nSee you.\nGIRL\nOf course.\nPAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.\n74.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nIn the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workmans arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears he looks at his wife in the workmans arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.\n77.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOOR\nThe DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push.\nNORM\nWorry, will you!\nSHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.\nDIRECTOR\nWell, thats it, two minutes to the final run-through... theyre bound to miss it...\nNORM\nIll murder that Lennon.\nDIRECTOR\nBut I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...\nSHAKE\n... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean itud be a pity to miss the show, wouldnt it like.\nNORM\nShurrup, cheerful.\nThe horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.\nDIRECTOR\nYou dont think...\nNORM\nTheyll be here.\nDIRECTOR\nOh now, they cant do that to me.\nIts all your fault.\nOh yes it is and if they dont turn up I wouldnt be in your shoes for all the...\nSHAKE\n... tea in China. Oh youre right, neither would I.\nHe steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR.\nNORM\nTraitor!\nSHAKE nods his agreement to this assessment of his character.\nSHAKE\nOf course.\nAt this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM.\nJOHN\nHi Norm!\nNORM\nHi, our lot!\nThe BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to.\nNORM\nOur lot!\nGEORGE\nDid you want something.\nNORM\nI could eat the lot of you.\nJOHN\nYoud look gear with an apple in your gob.\nDIRECTOR\nDo you realise you could have missed the final run-through?\nGEORGE\nSorry.\nSHAKE\nEh, theres only three of them.\nPAUL\nAye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back.\nDIRECTOR\nDo you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and youre one short.\nJOHN\nControl yourself or youll spurt. Hes bound to be somewhere.\nNORM\nAye, lets try the dressing room.\nEveryone starts along the passage. NORM and PAUL last.\nPAUL\nEh, wheres my grandfather?\nNORM\nDont worry about him. He can look after himself.\nPAUL\nAye, I suppose so.\nThey run after the others.\n78.\tEXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE CLOSE-UP\nGRANDFATHER\nHere they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!\nThe CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs. On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.\n79.\tINTERIOR POLICE STATION\nIt is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before.\nRINGO\nLook, Im Ringo Starr... Ive got a show to do in a few minutes youve got to let me go... Im Ringo...\nPOLICEMAN\nSure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I dont care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge.\nSERGEANT\nWhat is he?\nPOLICEMAN\nIve got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, hes done it.\nSERGEANT\nOh, a little savage, is he?\nPOLICEMAN\nA proper Aborigine.\nRINGO\nI demand to see me solicitor.\nSERGEANT\nWhats his name?\nRINGO\nOh, well if youre going to get technical --\nAt that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood.\nSERGEANT\nHello, its going to be one of those nights, is it?\nSit Charley Peace down over there.\nThe POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them.\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, you got me here so do your worst but Ill take one of you with me.\nOh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but Ill defy you still.\nSERGEANT\nIs there a fire, then?\nGRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.\nGRANDFATHER\nYou ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.\nSERGEANT\nEh?\nGRANDFATHER\nIll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.\nSERGEANT\nWhats he on about?\nGRANDFATHER\nIm soldier of the Republic, youll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.\nSERGEANT\nGet Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.\nThe POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth.\nGRANDFATHER\nRingo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?\nRINGO\nWell Im not exactly a voluntary patient.\nGRANDFATHER\nShush! Have they roughed you up yet?\nRINGO\nWhat?\nGRANDFATHER\nKeep your voice down, this lotll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh theyre a desperate crew of drippings and theyve fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.\nRINGO\nHave they?\nGRANDFATHER\nThat sergeants a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. Ill get the boys. Hold on son, Ill be back for you.\nRINGO\nMe!\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.\nRINGO\nOh, they seem all right to me.\nGRANDFATHER\nThats what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.\nSERGEANT\nWould you two like a cup of tea?\nGRANDFATHER\nYou see, sly villains.\nRINGO\nNo thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.\nWe now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeants desk.\nSERGEANT\nSo you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.\nPOLICEMAN\nYeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.\nSERGEANT\nWell, he cant stop here.\nShot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does.\nRINGO\nWhat are you doing?\nGRANDFATHER\nLip reading.\nRINGO\nWhat are they saying?\nGRANDFATHER\nNothing good.\nThe POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.\nGRANDFATHER\nWell son, its now or never.\nHe jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartneyll give you a run for your threepence hapenny.\nHe dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos.\nSERGEANT\nNow, whats he up to?\nRINGO\nHes allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies.\nThe POLICEMAN with the photos returns.\nPOLICEMAN\nYour man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.\nRINGO\nTurncoat!\nThe POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.\nCLOSE-UP RINGO\nRINGO\nMother!\n80.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nGRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.\nCLOSE-UP GRANDFATHERs horrified face.\nGRANDFATHER\nBe God, theyve called up reinforcements, the dragnets out!\nHe dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force.\nThey smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.\n81.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE CONTROL ROOM\nDIRECTOR\nOnly half an hour and youre on!\nGEORGE\nCan I say something?\nThe director clutches at any straw.\nDIRECTOR\nYes, anything.\nGEORGE\nIts highly unlikely well be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc....\nBut his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR.\n82.\tEXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR\nThe four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the\nsecurity guard.\nGUARD\nIll have the hides off of you lot.\nThe kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard.\nGUARD\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!\nGRANDFATHER\nI must see Pauly.\nGUARD\nGo home then and see him on the telly.\nThe GUARD re-enters the stage door.\nGRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer.\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you fix him for me?\nBOYS\nYeah.\nGRANDFATHER\nSixpence.\nBOY\nEach?\nGRANDFATHER is about to argue.\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, all right.\nBOY\nAnd in advance.\nGRANDFATHER\nMercenary!\nBut he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.\n83.\tINTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM ON STAGE\nGRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.\n84.\tINTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM\nThe DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage.\nDIRECTOR\nIts all right, leave him alone.\nPAUL\nGrandad, wheres Ringo?\nGRANDFATHER\nThe police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.\nBOYS\nThe police station.\nGRANDFATHER\nHell be pulp by now.\nJOHN\nWhat are we waiting for?\nGEORGE\nCome here.\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off.\nCLOSE-UP DIRECTOR\nDIRECTOR\nWeve only got twenty minutes.\n85.\tEXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.\n86.\tINTERIOR POLICE STATION\nThe DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive.

Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it.\nJOHN\nAh well, it was worth a try.\nINSPECTOR\nWhat do you think youre up to?\nSERGEANT\nArrest those boys, sir.\nINSPECTOR\nThats all we need to start a real riot!\nCome on lads, theyre waiting for you.\n###\tINTERIOR THEATRE BACKSTAGE\nThe Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on.\nDIRECTOR\nBoys, you dont know what this means to me. If you hadnt come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.\nNORM\nArent you supposed to be in that box?\nThe DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.\nPAUL\nAnd another thing, wheres that old mixer?\nGRANDFATHER\nHere, Pauly.\nAnd sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.\nPAUL\nWell, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.\nJOHN\nAw, leave him alone Paul, hes back, isnt he? And its not his fault hes old.\nPAUL\nWhats old got to do with it?\nJOHN\nYou neednt bother.\nPAUL\nYwhat?\nJOHN\nPractising to be thick-headed, youre there already.\nPAUL\nLook hes a mixer and a trouble maker!\nJOHN\nThats right, but hes only asking us to pay attention to him, arent you?\nFrom JOHNs P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man.\nJOHN\nYou see.\nYou know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. Youd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, youre a lonely old man from Liverpool.\nGRANDFATHER\nBut Im clean.\nThe BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.\n88.\tINTERIOR TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM\nWe see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audiences screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORMS P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHERs disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows.\n89.\tINTERIOR STUDIO CORRIDOR\nNORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem.\nNORM\nIve got the stuff. Come here.\nPAUL\nArent we ...\nNORM\nNo, were not!\nHe hurries them along.\nNORM\nThe office was on the phone, they think itd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.\nJOHN\nTonight? We cant make it ...\nNORM\nYouve got a midnight matinee.\nJOHN\nNow, look here, Norm ...\nNORM\nNo, you look here, John. Ive only one thing to say to you.\nJOHN\nWhat?\nNORM\nYoure a swine. So hurry up ... were travelling!\nNORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-passenger helicopter.\n90.\tEXTERIOR STAGE DOOR T.V. THEATRE\nThe BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter.\nPAUL\nWheres my grandfather?\nNORM\nDont start. Look.\nThe boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos.\nGRANDFATHER\nCome on, youre hanging up the parade.\nThe boys shout Get rid of those things, etc.\n91.\tEXTERIOR FIELD\nThe final shot is of the helicopter rising up . As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window.\nWe cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over it.", "There may be not much difference\nBetween Chairman Mao and Richard Nixon\nWe strip them naked\nThere may be not much difference\nBetween Marilyn Monroe and Lenny Bruce\nWe check their coffins\nThere may be not much difference\nBetween White House and Hall of People\nWe count their windows\nThere may be not much difference\nBetween Raquel Welch and Jerry Rubin\nWe hear their heartbeat\nWere all water from different rivers\nThats why its so easy to meet\nWere all water in this vast, vast ocean\nSomeday well evaporate together\nThere may be not much difference\nBetween Eldridge Cleaver and Queen of England\nWe bottle their tears\nThere may be not much difference\nBetween Manson and the Pope\nWe press their smile\nThere may be not much difference\nBetween Rockefeller and you\nWe hear you sing\nThere may not be much difference\nBetween you and me\nWe show our dreams\nHey!

Haldeman\nAssistant to the President\nThe White House\nWashington, D.C.\n1 - Mr. A. Rosen\n1 - Mr. T. E. Bishop\n1 - Mr. E. S. Miller\n1 - Mr. R. L. Shackelford\n1 - Mr. T. J. Smith \n1 - Mr. R. L. Pence\nDear Mr. Haldeman:\nJohn Winston Lennon is a British citizen and former member of the Beatles singing group. Lennon has taken an interest in extreme left-wing activities in Britain and is known to be a sympathizer of Trotskyite communists in England.\nDespite his apparent ineligibility for a United States visa due to a conviction in London in 1968 for possession of dangerous drugs, Lennon obtained a visa and entered the United States in 1971. During February, 1972, a confidential source, who has furnished reliable information in the past, advised that Lennon had contributed $75,000 to a newly organized New Left group formed to disrupt the Republican National Convention. The visas of Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono, expired on February 29, 1972, and since that time Immigration and Naturalization Service has been attempting to deport them. During the Lennons most recent deportation hearing at INS, New York, New York, on April 18, 1972, their attorney stated that Lennon felt he was being deported due to his outspoken remarks concerning United States policy in Southeast Asia.
