You’re immortal.\n-\nBut we’re exhausted!\n-\nWe don’t wanna feel this anymore!\n-\nWe must feel the physical pain of this world because the only way that we can truly learn is through experience.\n-\nPlease!\n-\nOh no. I’m gonna be late for class.\n-\nWho cares at this point?\n-\nTrue. I’m so exhausted.\n-\nSame.\n-\nDo you hear that?\n-\nI do. I think it’s coming from over here.\n-\nShould we check it out?\n-\nYeah. Okay, count of three.\n-\nOne, two, three!\n-\nWoah!\n-\nAchoo!\n-\nH-hello. You all look ravishing.\n-\nBewitching even!\n-\nWe should get to class... bye.\n-\nOkay, see you later. Bye.\n-\nTragedy and comedy. Two sides of the same dramatic coin and we are going to be exploring both in this play. Even the latecomers.\nAlright, everyone, please turn to your scripts. Look to page two and find the roles to which you’ve been assigned.\n-\nRight, so about that. Um, is it possible to get assigned a different role? Maybe one that’s not so domestic? Like a film director? Or the President of the United States!\n-\nA harlot perhaps?\n-\nPresident? What a joke. Your kind are too soft and too sensitive to handle a man’s job.\n-\nHaving a larger capacity to feel and express emotion are one of the many qualities that make us superior to your kind.\n-\nAhhhhhh!!!\n-\nYou’re being brainwashed!\n-\nWhat is this? What is she doing? Go get her. Go on!\n-\nCan’t you see what’s happening? Open your fucking eyes! Get off of me! Get off!

Did you guys find a place to dump the principal?\n-\nYeah, just did it. Done deal.\n-\nPerfect.\n-\nDid you guys know there are actually two holes down there?\n-\nYou didn’t know you had a butthole?\n-\nNo, I mean in your vagina. There are two separate holes!\n-\nAre you sure?\n-\nMmhmm.\n-\nI think I need to see a doctor.\n-\nHey guys....?\n-\nYeah, there’s your urethra and vagina.\n-\nYou guys?\n-\nOh okay, got it. So, one hole that you can pee out of and the other one that you can—\n-\nWhy does no one listen to me? Guys! The ball is floating away!\n-\nOh shit, the ball! I feel like we’re on the wrong way.\n-\nI swear, I just saw it.\n-\nWhat’s wrong, my dear?\n-\nI just don’t want to do this anymore. I don’t want to feel this pain and I don’t want to be here on Earth. Please just take me with you. I just want to be up there\n-\nThe greatest power you will hold is that of acceptance. Any storm you face will transform itself into a crystalline rainbow. In divine timing.\n-\nHey.\n-\nHmm?\n-\nYou there?\n-\nYeah\n- \n-\nYou ok?\n-\nAhh, I feel so sick. Like this is the worst stomach pain I’ve ever experienced.\n-\nOhhhh...\n-\nUgh, why right now!?\n-\nWell... I mean it had to happen sometime.\n-\nIt says there’s one tampon left. Do either of you have any change?\n-\nNo...\n-\nYes!\n-\nIt’s fucking empty. Whatever. Who knows what kind of crazy shit’s in them anyways.\n-\nI mean yes, toxic shock is real, but still tampons should be free.\n-\nWhat do I do now?\n-\nToilet paper.\n-\nMmmph.\n-\nYou good in there?\n-\nYeah\n-\nYou sure?\n-\nYeah, I’m almost done\n-\nNeed me to get you another roll of toilet paper?\n-\nThat’d be great, yeah.\n-\nI think I’m going to be late for class.\n-\nEmpathize with me a little!\n-\nI’m sorry.\n-\nOkay. Ummm...\n-\nCute sweater. Where’d you get that from?\n-\nJust whipped a little something up. What? I wasn’t going to walk around looking like I sat in raspberries all day.\n-\nGet back to class! You little bitch\n-\nYou guys. I don’t know how long I can go using this toilet paper method. It’s so annoying. It keeps moving around down there\n-\nWell, good thing you won’t have to deal with it much longer.\n-\nThank the Goddess!\n-\nShit. Are you serious? Fuck!\n-\nUhh... You go ahead. Let me know how it is\n-\nOk, I’ll cut you\n-\nHey.\n-\nThank God you’re back! I thought you were busy becoming a plastic carbon copy.\n-\nThis is Magnolia. Say hi.\n-\nNice to meet you ladies.\n-\nWelcome!\n-\nHi...\n-\nHoly shit!\n-\nIs she—\n-\nOne of us?\n-\nBut, how do we even go up to her? She’s sitting with Kelly!\n-\nFood fight, anyone?\n-\nHmmmm.\n-\nHmm\n-\nI like this girl.\n-\nHmm?\n-\nWhat? So I just throw it?\n-\nPretty sure that’s how food fights go down.\n-\nYeah, take it, take it, take it.\n-\nOk, fine. Ok. Three... Two... One... I don’t know.\n-\nJust do it already!\n-\nOkay!\n-\nOww!\n-\nFood fight!\n-\nYou’re fucking kidding me! You’re all heathens!\n-\nI’m gonna get in on this!\n-\nUh uh, not with this hair. I just had wash day.\n-\nOkay, so should we go up to her?\n-\nGet out of my way!\n-\nShe’s leaving with Kelly. Let’s go after them\n-\nYea, let’s just start a parade. No. Crybaby, I think you need to do this alone\n-\nOkay. Wish me luck.\n-\nAlright, good luck bitch.\n-\nSo barbaric.\n-\nAre you sure I can’t?\n-\nIf you don’t put that floor spaghetti down...\n-\nMan.\n-\nWanna know something I’ve learned about bodies? They don’t define us. We aren’t our bodies. They’re just temporary. I know it seems impossible, but try not to expect shallow people to love you. They don’t even have the capacity to understand how amazing you are. And we all have to learn to love ourselves without the approval of others\n-\nI know. It’s just extremely overwhelming when everyone around you is making you feel like you aren’t good enough. As if you’re not deserving the same kind of love if you’re different\n-\nEveryone is deserving of love. Everyone\n-\nCrybaby, over here\n-\nBanana! Eat it! Nanananana!\n-\nThis is Fleur\n-\nLucy! What did we talk about? Don’t touch me!\n-\nI know, I’m sorry. Isn’t that Crybaby with Fleur over there?\n-\nUgh!\n-\nIt’s crazy over there!\n-\nIt’s chaotic!\n-\nIt’s Leo... It’s the principal’s son\n-\nWho started this?\n-\nIt was that bitch, Crybaby. Behind the counter!\n-\nShut up!\n-\nOkay, guys, I think I have a pretty good plan to get us out of this shithole. Angelita, I need you to keep everyone in the gym. Keep them in one place and try to keep them quiet—\n-\nI caught a sparkle of light in your eyes that day. I bathed in it, was transported to heaven’s gates by it, but I fall at my feet. My words shall only be composed. I can’t speak. My inner voice calling my outer self weak admiring from afar secretly—\n-\nCrybaby? Earth to Crybaby. Are you in?\n-\nYeah. Sorry!\n-\nYour job is to manipulate Satan himself into letting you into his office so we can hijack that loudspeaker and get everyone out of here.\n-\nWhat’s that?\n-\nI think it’s a love letter.\n-\nA love letter from who?\n-\nI don’t know. It doesn’t say.\n-\nOkay guys, back to the plan. We already got rid of the principal, so that just leaves Leo.\n-\nWe walk into his office, make a run for it and then—\n-\nSet this place on fire?\n-\nExactly\n-\nI don’t know about that guys\n-\nI agree. Fire’s too cliché\n-\nI mean yeah, but at this point, what other options do we have?\n-\nI hope we don’t get caught\n-\nWe should be fine.\n...Do you ever wonder who we were to each other in a past life?\n-\nOh, for sure. We’ve probably had hundreds of lives together.\n-\nYou could’ve been my mom.\n-\nYeah, or we could’ve been...\n-\nConjoined twins!\n-\nAnd our parents sold us to a fucking freak show!\n-\nThat would explain a lot.\n-\nThat would. It’s crazy how many medical benefits mary jane has.\n-\nI know, and no one gives her any credit.\n-\nWe don’t deserve her.\n-\nWow.\n-\nSpeaking of magical plants.\n-\nYou got this. Super easy. Don’t stress. Uh, fuck. You wanna go to the dance? Do you wanna go to the dance with me?\n-\nYou alright? Hey.\n-\nHi.\n-\nYou okay?\n-\nMmmhmm.\n-\nYou sure?\n-\nYea, what’s up?\n-\nUm, I uh, was looking for you because I wanted to ask you. I would like you to go to the dance with me.\n-\nReally?\n-\nYeah.\n-\nWhy?\n-\nI don’t know if you got my note but...\n-\nWait, he wrote the letter? With that poetic touch, I just assumed it must have been written by a girl. Damn, well you know what they say. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer\n-\nI’d love to go with you!\n-\nGood.\n-\nCool.\n-\nOkay. Great.\n- Brandon why are you touching her? Why are you touching her? Lucy how could you do this to me, he’s mine. You’re just gonna stand there and watch this happen? I made you. You guys are nothing without me. Ughh\n- Ladies, this place looks sort of beautiful don’t you think?\n- It’ll make some beautiful ashes\n- I’m really nervous. Should we really be doing this?\n- It’ll be fine. Tonight’s the night\n- Just stick to the plan. I made it. It’s meticulous. You’ll be okay\n- Ladies. You know what you’ve gotta do\n- Wait. Why is she here?\n- Angelita, do you wanna dance with me now?\n- Don’t you wanna fuck off now? Ugh\n- There is no way in hell you had enough time to get rid of Leo\n- Yea, shouldn’t you be up there?\n- Where?\n- The loudspeaker\n- Yea. Why aren’t you up there?\n- Okay, so I got asked to the dance by Leo\n- What?!\n- I know\n- Girl. Seriously? You let that monster manipulate you?\n- Well—\n- Even I didn’t abandon ship this time, and trust me, I wanted to\n- I thought we were actually going to get out of this place for good\n- Look, I’m sorry. I am. Seriously? Look, I don’t know, I guess I was just—\n- Being selfish\n- Forget it\n- Wait!\n- Nope. It’s fine, just let her go. It’s fine\n- You fucked up the whole plan. And all for some asshole who doesn’t even like you. Real smart\n Eh, don’t beat yourself up\n -Ow. Ugh\n- Good evening and welcome to K-12’s 150th school dance\n- This isn’t part of the plan\n-Woo! Woo!\n- Now, before I let you all get back to dancing all night, quite literally, I would just like to say just one thing. Crybaby. I know what you’ve been up to. I’ve been watching you for a long time now. And did you all think that you could just kill my father, get away with it, have your nice little dance and leave?\n- Yes\n- I don’t think so Seniors. Not tonight\n- The doors are locked\n- So dance. Dance!\n- Dance!!\n- What’s happening?\n- What’s going on?\n- I mean I can’t stop\n- We gotta do something guys. I mean I love dancing but this is kinda ridiculous\n- We need to find Crybaby and stop this now\n- My powers won’t start. I’ve lost control\n- Yea, I can’t use mine neither\n- Where is she?\n- My legs are killing me\n- Hello miss. Can I help you?\n- Hi, I’m Lorelai. I’m here to apply for the assistant position\n- Um, yeah. The assistant position-\n- Where is she?\n- I can’t do this anymore\n- Crybaby where are you?\n- You know, I’ve always had this fantasy\n- What’s that?\n- Of getting nailed in a really confined space\n- Really?\n- Mmhmm\n- Well you are in luck. I had a dream like this once\n- Me too\n- Woah, woah, woah!\n- You bitch, let me out. Hey! Hey!\n Woah!\n- Yes! Yes!\n- Everybody, evacuate the school immediately. Go, now!\n- She’s safe\n- Come on, let’s go\n Move, move! Get out, get out!\n- Hey, let’s go! Come on!\n- Hey! Shit\n- What do I do? Oh my god. Think. Think\n- Hey! Hi\n- Shit! You have to go downstairs\n- It’s alright, I didn’t mean to startle you. I’m here to help\n- Look, I appreciate that but I really have to—\n- I’m Ben. I’m the one who wrote the love letter\n- Okay. How do we destroy this place? I don’t know what to do. Do you have any ideas?\n- Uh. Do you know how to blow spit bubbles?\n- What? What are you talking about? Why?\n- We can trap the school. We can lift the school up in a bubble\n- I don’t know. Okay, let’s try it\n- Where’s Crybaby?\n- I don’t know\n- Have you guys seen Crybaby?\n- No\n- That’s— Look\n- Are you ready?\n- Yea. I mean no. I haven’t really done this before so I can’t—\n- Ben. It’s our only option\n- Sorry\n- We have to try this, okay?\n- Okay. You’re right. You’re right\n- Woah\n- Well, damn\n- Pinch me if I’m dreaming. Ow\n- Holy shit, we don’t have much time until we’re too high up. We need to jump. Right now. On the count of three\n- If we jump, we’ll die\n- Fear of death is irrational right now Ben. Either we die in a few minutes, or we attempt to live right now. Okay?\n- Now\n- Ahhhhh!\n- Oh, ahh. What the fuck just happened? That’s it\n- Il y a du sang partout\n- What does that mean?\n- There’s blood everywhere. I don’t really know French. It’s just something I picked up as a kid. Had a French nanny. What?\n- Oh my God, it’s Lilith! \n- Guys come on!

She was wearing a crazy-looking necklace made from doll parts and she had made a video for her song Dollhouse by pulling in every favor she could get, the executive says.\nIt was such an impressive commitment, and it was all her vision.\nMartinez could sing, too, as she had demonstrated as a finalist on the third season of The Voice in 2012, and Greenwald says that her amazing voice and well-defined point of view convinced her and Atlantic co-chair Craig Kallman to sign the then-teenager to the label.\nWe wanted to give her the resources to go out there and build a real foundation, she says.\nNow 20, Martinez, who is of Puerto Rican and Dominican descent and a native of Baldwin, N.Y., worked with the songwriters Kinetics & One Love, and in May 2014 released an EP called Dollhouse, which contained the title track and Carousel.\nMartinez says the latter song is about an ex-boyfriend, and, perhaps in a bit of poetic justice, was used by Ryan Murphy as a soundtrack to a trailer for American Horror Story: Freak Show.\nMartinez then went to work on a full-length album, Cry Baby, which was released on Aug. 14, and although Dollhouse and Carousel make repeat appearances on the full-length release, the album is a fleshed-out expression of her dark, hyper-sensitive take on the underbelly of American life.\nWhile Cry Baby has its critics, the record has resonated with the record-buying public. With no radio play or national TV appearances by Martinez, Cry Baby debuted at No. 6 on the Billboard 200 chart dated Aug. 5 and currently resides at No. 26, having moved 54,000 units, according to Nielsen Music.\nThe singer-songwriter is currently out touring behind her new music, and her manager Ron Shapiro, who worked closely with Tori Amos and Jewel during his tenure as an executive at Atlantic, and Regina Spektor, whom he managed, says demand for tickets has been such that he is having to upgrade to larger capacity venues.\nMeanwhile, Greenwald says the label is taking the single Soap to alternative radio, where Martinez is getting some play, and is in the process of looking for TV appearances and other promotional opportunities for her.\nMartinez took time out from her touring schedule to talk about her new album, the persona shes created with Cry Baby and fans who show their appreciation for musical artists in rather bizarre ways.\n\nHave you ever seen David Lynchs Blue Velvet?\nNo, I havent.\nTheres a pretty iconic scene at the beginning of the movie where the camera opens on a beautiful, well-manicured suburb. The sun is shining and the grass is really green, and then bad stuff starts happening, the camera descends beneath the grass, and there are all these insects and creepy things slithering around. Your music struck a similar chord with me: The songs have these child-like titles and elements, but then you listen closely and the lyrics are brutally frank and really dark.\nWell, thank you.\nYoure 20, but your music makes you sound like youve lived a lot longer than that. Is that what its like being a young adult today?\nI dont know. I guess. I feel like, growing up, Ive always felt things a little bit harder than most people.\nWorking on this album has been very emotional and super personal, and creating this character Cry Baby helped me deal with my own insecurities. I was able to throw it all on to Cry Baby instead of myself, which really helped me. Its definitely been a process.\nWhen you say the album is super personal, have you lived these songs?\nThe song Carousel is about a boy that I dated. That was a personal one. And the first track on the album, Cry Baby, is too. Cry Baby is basically me. Ive been called cry baby, like, my entire life, and, growing up, I thought of it as an insult. I was super insecure about it because I did take things too personally, and, in the music business you cant be soft about things.\nIve definitely gotten better with that, but I think its been very hard for me because Im very emotional. So, writing this album and creating this character, I think, was me trying to turn the words cry baby into a compliment.\nYou embraced it.\nI realized that over time. Cry Baby goes through all these things, and some of the things Ive been through, and some Ive obviously made up because I love writing stories and making stuff up.\nTowards the end of the album, Cry Baby evolves into someone whos very comfortable in her skin, and I can definitely say that I have had the same kind of change within myself. Im a lot less insecure, and I have embraced a lot of the things that I hated about myself before.\nYou came of age at a time when pop music was mostly about singles, and yet, youve put out a collection of songs that holds together as an album. What are some of the albums that inspired you?\nI love The Idler Wheel... by Fiona Apple. Its one of my favorites. I love every single album that Cocorosie has put out, and I love the last two albums that Ariana Grande put out. When I listen to an artist, I listen to albums.\nObviously, the labels going to push a certain single, but you dont know if thats what the artist really wants or what theyre trying to do with their music. Its always important, I think, to listen to the hidden weirder tracks on the album in order to know what the artist is really about.\nIn the liner notes to Cry Baby, you thank anyone who made me cry, broke my heart, made me angry, or made me feel anything at all. As a songwriter, do you feel the need to go out there and get your heart scuffed up in order to write authentically?\nI dont write as well when Im happy, if thats what you mean. It really does suck. I can write about something that someone else has been through, whether its someone I actually know or a story Ive made up.\nI have a pretty good imagination, and I watch a lot of Law & Order . But I definitely feel more connected to the music that Im writing when Im in that actual place, and Im genuinely feeling what Im writing about.\nSo, yeah, thats what I prefer. Its a blessing and a curse because I find myself wanting to be more sad in session so I can write more. Its really messed up, but its the truth.\nSo where does your dark streak come from?\nI dont know. Really.\nListening to your lyrics, you seem anti-alcohol and drug and, judging from the song Mrs. Potato Head, anti-plastic surgery. Do your lyrics reflect how you really feel about these subjects?\nIm definitely not anti-alcohol or drugs. I smoke weed, and I drink occasionally, but Im like any normal human being.\nIm not anti-anything, really. I just think that these subjects can be used in songs in ways other than, Im gonna like party all night and get f---ed up. Id rather talk about those subjects in a more meaningful way.\nBut the plastic surgery thing, yeah, exactly. Mrs. Potato Head was something that I had in my head for a long time. I liked the visual of being able to pull apart pieces off of a toys face. Its interesting how that can double as a metaphor for plastic surgery. It took a while to put on paper, though. That was the most challenging song to write, but it was worth it.\nSo, youve created the persona of Cry Baby. Do you envision yourself as an artist like, say, David Bowie, where you will change personas as you move through different periods of your career? Or is Cry Baby going to be around for a while?\nIm not sure yet. Cry Baby is me, so its kind of hard for me to let go of a character that really isnt a character, you know? Im still figuring it out.\nThe couple of songs that Ive written for my next album -- if I was to stick with the Cry Baby character, I could definitely continue the story in some way.\nBut if not, I still want what I do next to be in the same world. If you were looking at it like a movie, Cry Baby is a girl in town and now that Ive told her story, Im next going to talk about her neighbor. I still want it be connected in some way.\nYou do seem to have created a world around Cry Baby. You conceived of the packaging for the record as a kind of See Dick and Jane Run reading primer for messed-up people. \nI wanted it to be like a baby board book for adults, and my friend Chloe Terisigni -- shes like 19 years old and incredible, and she illustrated all of it. She was able to like bring everything that was in my head onto paper, and Im so happy with it. Its my first album, its like my baby, and to have someone who I love as an artist draw the entire thing -- its just a great feeling.\nYou also conceive of and star in your own videos. You built the sets for Dollhouse, did the wardrobe and now have directed your last three videos for the album, Pity Party, Sippy Cup and Soap. Whats it like for a very independent, self-directed artist to work with a major label that is used to leading when it comes to shaping and marketing artists work?\nIm always going to have my ups and downs, but so far, its been pretty incredible how much control Atlantic has let me have in the past year or so.\nI get to direct my own music videos now. I wasnt able to do that in the beginning, but I did write all the storyboards for the videos for Dollhouse and Carousel.\nObviously, someone else directed them because I wasnt really confident enough to feel like I could take on that role. But once I told Atlantic that I was ready, they were, like, Okay, lets do this.\nI realize its a little early in your career to be asking this, but do you see yourself eventually working in film or television? I mean, this fall, Lady Gaga will play a substantial role in Ryan Murphys American Horror Story: Hotel. \nI would definitely love to dip my hands in whatever I can. Right now, Im just so focused on writing music. Im on tour, and all I want to do is write.\nBut I do want to make a music video for every single song on my album and connect all of them and tell the story of the album visually. I know its going to take a while, but thats something that Im just willing to go broke for, you know.\nAre you funding these videos yourself?\nSome of them, yeah. Dollhouse was fan funded. Carousel and Pity Party were done with the label. But there are definitely times when Ive been like, Im going to pay for this if no one will because I really need it. Ill just do an extra show or whatever to make sure that I get it done.\nI actually paid for the physical copies of the album -- the storybook -- because its so detailed and cost so much to produce the extra pages. I did three VIP shows because I really wanted my album to look like that.\nSpeaking of performing, you recently had your purse stolen at a show and then wrote an interesting Tumblr post addressing the trolls who responded to your attempts to get it back. I know that youve moved on, but Im wondering if your post had any effect on the fans who call you Mom and otherwise behave like tools.\nI hope it was, because it has been something thats been on my mind for a while. Im sure that its on every artists mind 24/7 and its really hard for us to speak up about it because were judged so harshly. I would like to live in a world where artists and fans can have a better relationship.\nFans are always reaching out and asking for a better relationship. They say, I want to be your best friend, but they dont really make you feel like you can open up to them, you know? Because if you were really friends with someone you wouldnt judge them. You express anything to them, and theyll know everything about you and theyre fine with that. I would like for that to be how people treat me.\nTaylor Swift recently weighed in on fans calling her Mom, too. \nThey may think its endearing to call you mom and queen, but it actually puts so much pressure on you to, like, stay perfect and to be someone that like they can look up to. And like thats not why I make music. I dont care to be anybodys role model.\nIts just something that Ive been thinking about for a while, and I really wanted to express how hurt I was because someone had taken something so personal to me. I mean, thats so illegal, too.\nWas it a fan that stole your purse?\nYeah. Ive gotten stuff stolen before. On one of my tours, I wore a vintage robe onstage that my friend let me borrow. I took it off onstage, and when I walked offstage, someone climbed up onto the stage and took it. Security was not very good that night.\nThats pretty brazen.\nThats why I was even crazier this time. But I was able to get the robe back by going on social media. Someone told me, My friend has it, but hes too scared to talk. So I was able to get his address and we drove to his house. And even then, he was so rude about the whole situation.\nI told him that I was personally going to come and get it, and there was this whole thing about, My mom doesnt want you to come in, and shes sleeping and blah blah blah. I was like, I dont want to come inside your house. I dont want to meet your parents. I just want my robe back. You have something that doesnt belong to you.\nSo, the kid put the robe in his mailbox, and my drummer went out and grabbed it. We saw the kid watching us from the blinds the whole time.\nThat experience could be a song. \nYeah. You saw his little eyes peeking through the blinds. So, my drummer got the robe back, and then the kid wrote all over Twitter, She didnt even come herself. She sent someone else to get it.\nAnd I wrote back, No, I was there. I was in the car, and I saw you hiding behind your blinds.\nIts so funny. You get your stuff stolen and then somehow they love to twist it and like make it about how you did something wrong. Youre like not treated like a human being.\nI hear youre a fan of horror movies. What are some of your favorites?\nThe Shining is my like favorite classic horror movie. Im trying to think. I hate that my brain just goes into stealth mode when I like try to think of my favorite things. Im going to stick with The Shining.\nI realize that The Voice is long behind you, but Im wondering if you learned anything from that experience that you still use today in terms of your music and performances?\nI definitely learned a lot about the whole behind the scenes of TV, and Im definitely not like, Oh, everything is so perfect, and Im having such a great time its so perfect, you know? When I was 15 thats obviously what I thought.\nAnd then when I auditioned when I was 16, I realized that its actually very crazy behind the scenes. Im definitely more comfortable in front of a camera because of it. Which is cool because I was not before that. I was very awkward. And I definitely made a lot of great friends that Im still friends with today.\nThe tour is going well. Youre selling out a lot of dates and in Nashville, Pittsburgh, Detroit and Minneapolis, theyre having to find venues with larger crowd capacities to meet ticket demand. \nI didnt think it would happen so fast, but Im really excited because we have these huge Cry Baby blocks that light up and stuff and didnt fit on some of the smaller stages. So its cool that we can actually use them now.\nWhats the age range of the fans that are coming out to your shows?\nIf its an all-ages show, itll be literally all ages. There will be really weird creepy, like, 60-year-old male humans who come and then there will also be 9-year-old girls there and everything in between.\nThats…\nVery confusing .", "Everyone’s so soft everyone’s so sensitive\nDo I offend you you’re hanging on my sentences\nYou can keep your costume you can keep your mask and\nI’m bout to take a bow and get out of this class\nI never signed up for your drama\nUp for your drama, up for your drama club\nI never signed up for your drama\nUp for your drama club\nThey try to feed you lines that you have to memorize\nYou always hide behind your Wizard of Oz disguise\nDo you even have a brain?

Anyway, enjoy the lyrics from this snippet :)", "“The whole experience of putting out this record has been really magical, Martinez says of her debut album.\nOn this week’s Billboard 200 albums chart, Melanie Martinez’s debut LP Cry Baby comes in at No. 153. More notably, the album celebrates its 104th straight week on the chart, a two-year run without ever slipping off the tally.\nThe fact that the album -- which has not produced a Billboard Hot 100-charting song -- has persisted on the albums chart following its August 2015 release is a testament to the connection Martinez has developed with her listeners.\n“I can’t believe it’s been two years -- it’s really surreal,” Martinez tells Billboard. “The whole experience of putting out this record has been really magical, and the people that I’ve met are really special.\nThe 22-year-old also recognizes how rare it is to release a debut pop album with no radio hits and still sell an impressive amount of copies.\nInstead of relying on hooks designed for Top 40, Martinez has found an audience by combining dark alt-pop, vulnerable storytelling and a penchant for striking audio-visual ideas .\nHer committed aesthetic has helped Cry Baby, a concept album about the perils of growing up, grow from 40,000 equivalent album units in its first week of release -- good enough for a No. 6 debut on the Billboard 200 -- to 1 million units to date, according to Nielsen Music, with 388,000 in traditional album sales.\n“My whole mission in general, ever since I was fourteen, was to write music that would help people heal,” Martinez explains.\n“Music is like therapy for me, so I wanted to do that for other people or be that for other people. I’m just grateful that it’s resonating with that many people. I could not be more grateful, really.”\nMartinez also isn’t finished with Cry Baby just yet: a video for the album’s final song, “Mad Hatter,” was put together three weeks ago, and Martinez describes it as “the finale” of her debut album.\n“It’s a lot of CGI animation stuff,” she says, “so right now they’re working on the effects and hopefully I’ll be able to put that out by end of September.”\nMeanwhile, Martinez is deep into her sophomore album, saying that her standard track list is being mastered and that she’s finishing up the bonus tracks now.\nBut the music is only one part of Martinez’s next audio-visual experience: instead of releasing a new video every few months , Martinez will release a feature film to accompany her second project, a musical that weaves all of her new songs into a storyline.\n“It’s all of the videos together of the next record, all thirteen, with dialogue and whatnot in between connecting all of them together. and I’m directing it and writing it and styling it and doing the makeup,” Martinez explains.\n“The film is really a huge priority of mine, because it’s really important to me that people can truly understand the sentiment and the story when they hear the record for the first time, and I really want people to be able to follow along properly. … I have such a clear vision in my head, but it’s always about the execution. I’m a perfectionist, and even if something comes out great, it’s still not perfect, you know?”\nWhile Martinez can’t share any details of the movie, the album and the story that connects the two, she does confirm that the concept will be reflected in her live show as well. “It’s basically going to be similar to the way a ballet is set up, with an intermission and stuff,” she says.\n“There’s going to be a lot of choreography. For the first time I’m doing choreography, which is also something I have to work on -- you know, exercising and eating right, all that stuff. I have to stop eating so much grilled cheese and chocolate chip cookies and start really working on everything!”\nBecause she’s been so busy wrapping up her first album cycle and poring over her second one, Martinez says that she hasn’t had the time or energy for social media; in fact, she doesn’t have Twitter or Instagram on her phone anymore.\n“I don’t think I’ve posted in like three months,” she says with a laugh.\nAnd because she’s so focused, Martinez didn’t realize the two-year anniversary of Cry Baby was approaching until her manager reminded her.\n“It’s just been an insane journey so far,” she says, “and just working on growing every day and really finishing up this next record, so that I can go back out on the road and do it all over again.”", "Pupils begin to observe\nWatching the waste on this earth\nMamas dont love their kids like they used to\nLetting them smoke their herbs\nNails bitten down to the nub\nPalms light on fire as they rub\nSoup never reaches its boil\nDinner ain’t the only thing they spoil\nLet the maggots and worms infest your brains\nCut your memory off, Alzheimers begins\nLet that hell of a drug emerge in your veins\nAnd I will claim that I love you\nAnd I am the one who birthed you\nSkin tearin down to the bone\nFreckles fall off as they’re told\nYou realize soon your identity changes\nNo longer the person you were\nNo longer the person they adore\nLet the maggots and worms infest your brains\nCut your memory off, Alzheimers begins\nLet that hell of a drug emerge in your veins\nAnd I will claim that I love you\nAnd I am the one who birthed you\nThank you, mama, for all youve done\nGave me cancer and thick black lungs\nLeft me rotting on the street\nRather shoot up than have food to eat\nLet the maggots and worms infest your brains\nCut your memory off, Alzheimers begins\nLet that hell of a drug emerge in your veins\nAnd I will claim that I love you\nI am the one who birthed you\nAnd I am the one who birthed you\nDo-do-do-do-do-do\nDo-do-do-do-do-do\nMamas dont love their kids like they used to\nLetting them smoke their herbs", "Lyrics for this song have yet to be released.

The sanctuaries in the game incorporate the 4 past sanctuaries in addition to 3 new sanctuaries: fire, water and wind. To approach the new sanctuaries, you should initially finish a couple of levels in the backwoods sanctuary\nThe game methodology proceeds with similar ideas as in the past games in the establishment. Fireboy and Watergirl should cooperate to finish each level. Fireboy should stay away from water pools and Watergirl should keep away from magma pools. Each level is a kind of puzzle where the members need to sort out the correct moves they should do to finish it. As you complete each level, gather however many jewels as you can to improve score. On the off chance that you discover a level to be too hard you can find support in the walkthrough video, later in this page\nThe Fire Temple levels are remarkable in light of the fact that they contain just magma pools that Fireboy can stroll around in and no water pools. Despite the fact that it appears to be a simple sanctuary for Fireboy it precisely the inverse. Fireboy should do all the difficult work to clear a path for Watergirl to have the option to arrive at its entryway. It is a joint exertion all things considered\nThe Water Temple is a similar idea as the Fire Temple just with water. All levels of the Water Temple have just water pools where Watergirl can stroll around openly. This doesnt mean a simple sanctuary for Watergirl. Watergirl should run in any event twice as much as Fireboy to track down a protected entry for her red pal\nVisit here : https://madboyhub.com/", "Je suis incertaine de mon corps nu\nPrends du recul,
