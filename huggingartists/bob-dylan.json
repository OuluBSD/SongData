the story of the Hurricane\nThe man the authorities came to blame\nFor something that he never done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world\nThree bodies lyin there\nDoes Patty see\nAnd another man named Bello\nMoving around mysteriously\n“I didn’t do it,” he says\nAnd he throws up his hands\n“I was only robbin the register\nI hope you understand\nI saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops\n“One of us had better call up the cops”\nAnd so Patty calls the cops\nAnd they arrive on the scene\nWith their red lights flashin\nIn the hot New Jersey night\nMeanwhile, far away in another part of town\nRubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin around\nNumber one contender for the middleweight crown\nHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go down\nWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the road\nJust like the time before and the time before that\nIn Paterson that’s just the way things go\nIf you’re black\nYou might as well not show up on the street\nUnless you want to draw the heat\nAlfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops\nHim and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowling around\nHe said, “I saw two men running out\nThey looked like middleweights\nThey jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”\nAnd Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\nCop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”\nSo they took him to the infirmary\nAnd though this man could hardly see\nThey told him that he could identify the guilty men\nFour in the morning and they haul Rubin in\nThey take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs\nThe wounded man looks up through his one dying eye\nSays, “Why did you bring him in here for?\nHe aint the guy!”\nHere’s the story of the Hurricane\nThe man the authorities came to blame\nFor something that he never done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\nRubin’s in South America, fighting for his name\nWhile Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game\nAnd the cops are putting the screws to him\nLookin for somebody to blame\n“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”\n“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”\n“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”\n“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw\nRunning that night?”\n“Don’t forget that you are white”\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”\nThe cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break\nWe got you for the motel job\nAnd we’re talking to your friend Bello\nNow you don’t want to have to go back to jail\nBe a nice fellow\nYou’ll be doing society a favor\nThat son of a bitch is brave and gettin braver\nWe want to put his ass in stir\nWe want to pin this triple murder\nOn him\nHe ain’t no Gentleman Jim”\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\nBut he never did like to talk about it all that much\nIt’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay\nAnd when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way\nUp to some paradise\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\nWhere they try to turn a man\nInto a mouse\nAll of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance\nThe trial was a pig-circus\nHe never had a chance\nThe judge made Rubin’s witnesses\nDrunkards from the slums\nTo the white folks who watched\nHe was a revolutionary bum\nAnd to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\nThe D.A. said he was the one\nWho did the deed\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\nThe crime was murder “one,”\nGuess who testified?\nBello and Bradley and they both baldly lied\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\nHow can the life of such a man\nBe in the palm of some fool’s hand?\nTo see him obviously framed\nCouldn’t help but make me feel ashamed\nTo live in a land\nWhere justice is a game\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\nAre free to drink Martinis\nAnd watch the sun rise\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha\nIn a ten-foot cell\nAn innocent man in a living hell\nYes that’s the story of the Hurricane\nBut it won’t be over till they clear his name\nAnd give him back the time he’s done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been\nThe champion of the world", "Well, it aint no use to sit and wonder why, babe\nIfn you dont know by now\nAnd it aint no use to sit and wonder why, babe\nItll never do somehow\nWhen your rooster

a-falling\nI’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest\nWhere the people are many and their hands are all empty\nWhere the pellets of poison are flooding their waters\nWhere the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison\nAnd the executioner’s face is always well hidden\nWhere hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten\nWhere black is the color, where none is the number\nAnd I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it\nAnd reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it\nThen I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking\nBut I’ll know my song well before I start singing\nAnd it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard\nIt’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall", "Heading down south to the land of the pines\nIm thumbing my way into North

you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”\nShe said that for over an hour\nAnd I hung up\nWell, the doctor interrupted me just about then\nSaying “Hey I’ve been having the same old dreams\nBut mine was a little different, you see\nI dreamt the only person left after the war was me\nI didn’t see you around\nWell, now time passed and now it seems\nEverybody’s having them dreams\nEverybody sees their self\nWalking around with no one else\nHalf of the people can be part right all of the time\nAnd some of the people can be all right part of the time\nBut all of the people can’t be all right all of the time\nI think Abraham Lincoln said that\n“I’ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours”\nI said that", "I’ve seen love go by my door\nIt’s never been this close before\nNever been so

across your face\nYou could make me cry, if you don’t know\nCan’t remember what I was thinking of\nYou might be spoilin’ me too much, love\nYoure gonna make me lonesome when you go\nFlowers on the hillside blooming crazy\nCrickets talking back and forth in rhyme\nBlue river running slow and lazy\nI could stay with you forever and never realize the time\nSituations have ended sad\nRelationships have all been bad\nMine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud\nBut there’s no way I can compare\nAll them scenes to this affair\nYoure gonna make me lonesome when you go\nYoure gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’\nStaying far behind without you\nYoure gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’\nYoure gonna make me give myself a good talking-to\nI’ll look for you in old Honolulu\nSan Francisco or Ashtabula\nYoure gonna have to leave me now, I know\nBut I’ll see you in the sky above\nIn the tall grass, in the ones I love\nYoure gonna make me lonesome when you go", "If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier\nShe left here last early Spring, is livin there, I hear\nSay for me that Im all right though things get kind of slow\nShe might think that Ive forgotten her, dont tell her it isnt so\nWe had a falling out, like lovers often will\nAnd to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill\nAnd though our separation, it pierced me to the heart\nShe still lives inside of me, weve never been apart\nIf you get close to her, kiss her once for me\nAlways have respected her for doing what she did and gettin free\nOh, whatever makes her happy, I wont stand in the way\nThough the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay\nI see a lot of people as I make the rounds\nAnd I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town\nAnd Ive never gotten used to it, Ive just learned to turn it off\nEither Im too sensitive or else Im gettin soft\nSundown, yellow moon, I replay the past\nI know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast\nIf shes passin back this way, Im not that hard to find\nTell her she can look me up if shes got the time", "Oh my name it aint nothin\nMy age it means less\nThe country I come from\nIs called

fall\nThe cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall\nThe curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down\nAnyone with any sense had already left town\nHe was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts\nHe moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said\nThen everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads\nThen he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin\n“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”\nThen he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts\nBackstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs\nLily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair\nOutside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide\nA gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside\nLily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts\nBig Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the towns only diamond mine\nHe made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine\nWith his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place\nHe took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste\nBut his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts\nRosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town\nShe slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown\nShe fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear\n“Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didnt seem to hear\nHe was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts\n“I know I’ve seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself\n“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”\nBut then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim\nAnd in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him\nStaring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts\nLily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child\nShe did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled\nShe had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs\nWith men in every walk of life which took her everywhere\nBut she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts\nThe hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined\nThe drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind\nIt was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring\nAnd nothing would ever come between Lily and the king\nNo, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts\nRosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife\nShe was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife\nShe had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide\nWas looking to do just one good deed before she died\nShe was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts\nLily took her dress off, buried it away\n“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must\nHave known it would someday\nBe careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint\nI’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”\nDown the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts\nThe backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair\n“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”\nHe went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk\nAs the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk\nThere was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts\nNo one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick\nThe door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked\nAnd Big Jim was standing there, ya couldnt say surprised\nRosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes\nShe was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts\nTwo doors down the boys finally made it through the wall\nAnd cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul\nIn the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground\nFor one more member who had business back in town\nBut they couldnt go no further without the Jack of Hearts\nThe next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black\nBig Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back\nAnd Rosemary on the gallows, she didnt even blink\nThe hanging judge was sober, he hadnt had a drink\nThe only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts\nThe cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”\nLily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair\nShe was thinking ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw\nThinking ’bout Rosemary and thinking about the law\nBut most of all she was thinking ’bout the Jack of Hearts", "I was riding on the Mayflower\nWhen I thought I spied some land\nStart again\nWait a minute now\nOkay, take two\nI was

engines\nChange the sail\nHaul on the bowline\nWe sang that melody\nLike all tough sailors do\nWhen theyre far away at sea\nI think Ill call it America\nI said as we hit land\nI took a deep breath\nI

loon\nHe throws us all in jail\nFor carrying harpoons\nAh, me I busted out\nDont even ask me how\nI went to get some help\nI walked by a Guernsey cow\nWho directed me down\nTo the Bowery slums\nWhere people carried signs around\nSayin, Ban the bums\nI jumped right into line\nSayin I hope that Im not late\nWhen I realized I hadnt eaten\nFor five days straight\nI went into a restaurant\nLooking for the cook\nI told him I was the editor\nOf a famous etiquette book\nThe waitress he was handsome\nHe wore a powder blue cape\nI ordered some Suzette, I said\nCould you please make that Crepe?\nJust then the whole kitchen exploded\nFrom boilin fat\nFood was flyin everywhere\nI left without my hat\nNow, I didnt mean to be nosy\nBut I went into a bank\nTo get some bail for Arab\nAnd all the boys back in the tank\nThey asked me for some collateral\nAnd I pulled down my pants\nThey threw me in the alley\nWhen up comes this girl from France\nWho invited me to her house\nI went, but she had a friend\nWho knocked me out\nAnd robbed my boots\nAnd I was on the street again\nWell, I rapped upon a house\nWith the U.S. flag upon display\nI said, Could you help me out\nI got some friends down the way\nThe man says, Get out of here\nIll tear you limb from limb\nI said, You know they refused Jesus, too\nHe said, Youre not Him\nGet out of here before I break your bones\nI aint your pop\nI decided to have him arrested\nAnd I went lookin for a cop\nI ran right outside\nI hopped inside a cab\nI went out the other door\nThis Englishman said, Fab\nAs he saw me leap a hot dog stand\nAnd a chariot that stood\nParked across from a building\nAdvertising brotherhood\nI ran right through the front door\nLike a hobo sailor does\nBut it was just a funeral parlor\nAnd the man asked me who I was\nI repeated that my friends\nWere all in jail, with a sigh\nHe gave me his card\nHe said, Call me if they die\nI shook his hand and said goodbye\nRan out to the street\nWhen a bowling ball came down the road\nAnd knocked me off my feet\nA pay phone was ringing\nAnd it just about blew my mind\nWhen I picked it up and said hello\nThis foot came through the line\nWell, by this time Is fed up\nAt tryin to make a stab\nAt bringing back any help\nFor my friends and captain Arab\nI decided to flip a coin\nLike either heads or tails\nWould let me know if I should go\nBack to ship or back to jail\nSo I hocked my sailor suit\nAnd I got a coin to flip\nIt came up tails\nIt rhymed with sails\nSo I made it back to the ship\nWell, I got back and took\nThe parking ticket off the mast\nI was ripping it to shreds\nWhen this coastguard boat went past\nThey asked me my name\nAnd I said, Captain Kidd\nThey believed me but\nThey wanted to know\nWhat exactly that I did\nI said for the Pope of Eruke\nI was employed\nThey let me go right away\nThey were very paranoid\nWell, the last I heard of Arab\nHe was stuck on a whale\nThat was married to the deputy\nSheriff of the jail\nBut the funniest thing was\nWhen I was leavin the bay\nI saw three ships sailin\nThere were all heading my way\nI asked the captain what his name was\nAnd how come he didnt drive a truck\nHe said his name was Columbus\nI just said, Good luck", "I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky\nWhen the children were babies and played on the beach\nYou came up behind me, I saw you go by\nYou were always so close and still within

next time we wed\nIf I only could hang on and just be her friend\nI still can’t remember all the best things she said\nWe came to the pyramids, all embedded in ice\nHe said “There’s a body I’m trying to find\nIf I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”\nTwas then that I knew what he had on his mind\nThe wind it was a-howlin, and the snow was outrageous\nWe chopped through the night\nAnd we chopped

flashing\nFlashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight\nFlashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight\nAnd for each and every underdog soldier in the night\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\nThrough the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched\nWith faces hidden as the walls were tightening\nAs the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain\nDissolved into the bells of the lightning\nTolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake\nTolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked\nTolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\nThrough the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail\nThe sky cracked its poems in naked wonder\nThat the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze\nLeavin only bells of lightning and its thunder\nStriking for the gentle, striking for the kind\nStriking for the guardians and protectors of the mind\nAnd the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\nAnd the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales\nFor disrobed faceless forms of no position\nTolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts\nAll down in taken-for-granted situations\nTolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute\nFor the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute\nFor the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\nEven though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flared\nAnd the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting\nElectric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones\nCondemned to drift or else be kept from driftin\nTolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail\nFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\nAnd for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\nStarry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught\nTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\nAs we listened one last time and we watched with one last look\nSpellbound and swallowed ’til the tolling ended\nTolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed\nFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse\nAnd for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\nAnd we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin", "Let me in here\nI know Ive been here\nLet me into your heart\nLet me know you\nLet me show you\nLet me roll it to you\nAll I

the point as straight as you can”\n“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan\nCame riding through the woods and took her by the hand”\nThe boss he lay back flat on his bed\nHe cursed the heat and he clutched

onward he went\nHe came to a place where the light was dull\nHis forehead pounding in his skull\nHeavy heart was racked with pain\nInsomnia raging in his brain\nWell, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword\nHe renounced his faith, he denied his lord\nCrawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall\nOne way or another put an end to it all\nHe leaned down, cut the electric wire\nStared into the flames and he snorted the fire\nPeered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two\nIt was hard to tell for certain who was who\nHe lowered himself down on a golden chain\nHis nerves were quaking in every vein\nHis knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air\nHe ran his fingers through his greasy hair\nThey looked at each other and their glasses clinked\nOne single unit, inseparably linked\n“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by”\n“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly”\nFrom behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor\nHe moved his feet and

see”\n“Oh, please let not your heart be cold\nThis man is dearer to me than gold”\n“Oh, my dear, you must be blind\nHe’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind”\n“You’ve had your way too long with me\nNow it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be”\n“Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed\n‘You’ll have to try to get past me first”\n“Do not let your passion rule\nYou think my heart the heart of a fool\nAnd you, sir, you can not deny\nYou made a monkey of me, what and for why?”\n“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat\nThe devil can have you, I’ll see to that\nLook sharp or step aside\nOr in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died”\nThe gun went boom and the shot rang clear\nFirst bullet grazed his ear\nSecond ball went right straight in\nAnd he bent in the middle like a twisted pin\nHe crawled to the corner and he lowered his head\nHe gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed\nIt would take more than needle and thread\nBleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead\n“You shot my husband down, you fiend”\n“Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?\nHe was a man of strife, a man of sin\nI cut him down and threw him to the wind”\nThis she said with angry breath\n“You too shall meet the lord of death\nIt was I who brought your soul to life”\nThen she raised her robe and she drew out a knife\nHis face was hard and caked with sweat\nHis arms ached and his hands were wet\n“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife\nIf you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife”\n“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot\nBut we’re no way similar in body or thought\nAll husbands are good men, as all wives know”\nThen she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow\nHis knees went limp and he reached for the door\nHis tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor\nHe whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault\nMy fighting days have come to a halt”\nShe touched his lips and kissed his cheek\nHe tried to speak but his breath was weak\n“You died for me, now I’ll die for you”\nShe put the blade to her heart and she ran it

Its not a poem, its... This is the first concert I played alone in New York, really. An a fellow in Brooklyn State Hospital, his name is Woody Guthrie. But Woody is more than a folk singer. Hes really something else more than a folk singer and theres this book coming out thats dedicated to him. And they asked me to write something about Woody, like what does Woody mean to you in 25 words. And I couldnt do it, I wrote out 5 pages and I have it here. I have it here by accident actually. But Id like to say this out loud. So this is my feelings towards Woody Guthrie. Cannot really be told in how many records of his I buy, its a lot more than that actually. So if you can roll along with this thing here this is called Last Thoughts On Woody Guthrie\nWhen yer head gets twisted and yer mind grows numb\nWhen you think youre too old, too young, too smart or too dumb\nWhen yer laggin behind an losing yer pace\nIn a slow-motion crawl of lifes busy race\nNo matter what yer doing if you start givin up\nIf the wine dont come to the top of yer cup\nIf the winds got you sideways with one hand holdin on\nAnd the other starts slipping and the feeling is gone\nAnd yer train engine fire needs a new spark to catch it\nAnd the woods easy findin but yer lazy to fetch it\nAnd yer sidewalk starts curlin and the street gets too long\nAnd you start walkin backwards though you know its wrong\nAnd lonesome comes up as down goes the day\nAnd tomorrows morning seems so far away\nAnd you feel the reins from yer pony are slippin\nAnd yer rope is a-slidin cause yer hands are a-drippin\nAnd yer sun-decked desert and evergreen valleys\nTurn to broken down slums and trash-can alleys\nAnd yer sky cries water and yer drain pipes a-pourin\nAnd the lightnins a-flashing and the thunders a-crashin\nAnd the windows are rattlin and breakin and the roof tops a-shakin\nAnd yer whole worlds a-slamming and banging\nAnd yer minutes of sun turn to hours of storm\nAnd to yourself you sometimes say\nI never knew it was gonna be this way\nWhy didnt they tell me the day I was born\nAnd you start gettin chills and yer jumping from sweat\nAnd youre looking for something you aint quite found yet\nAnd yer knee-deep in the dark water with yer hands in the air\nAnd the whole worlds a-watching with a window peek stare\nAnd yer good gal leaves and shes long gone a-flying\nAnd yer heart feels sick like fish when theyre frying\nAnd yer jackhammer falls from yer hand to yer feet\nAnd you need it badly but it lays on the street\nAnd yer bells bangin loudly but you cant hear its beat\nAnd you think yer ears might a been hurt\nOr yer eyesve turned filthy from the sight-blinding dirt\nAnd you figured you failed in yesterdays rush\nWhen you were faked out an fooled while facing a four flush\nAnd all the time you were holdin three queens\nAnd its making you mad, its makin you mean\nLike in the middle of Life magazine\nBouncin around a pinball machine\nAnd theres something on yer mind you wanna be saying\nThat somebody someplace oughta be hearin\nBut its trapped on yer tongue and sealed in yer head\nAnd it bothers you badly when youre laying in bed\nAnd no matter how you try you just cant say it\nAnd yer scared to yer soul you just might forget it\nAnd yer eyes get swimmy from the tears in yer head\nAnd yer pillows of feathers turn to blankets of lead\nAnd the lions mouth opens and yer staring at his teeth\nAnd his jaws start closing with you underneath\nAnd yer flat on your belly with yer hands tied behind\nAnd you wish youd never taken that last detour sign\nAnd you say to yourself just what am I doing\nOn this road Im walkin, on this trail Im turnin\nOn this curve Im hanging\nOn this pathway Im strolling, in the space Im taking\nIn this air Im inhaling\nAm I mixed up too much, am I mixed up too hard\nWhy am I walking, where am I running\nWhat am I saying, what am I knowing\nOn this guitar Im playing, on this banjo Im frailin\nOn this mandolin Im strumming, in the song Im singin\nIn the tune Im humming, in the words Im writin\nIn the words that Im thinking\nIn this ocean of hours Im all the time drinkin\nWho am I helping, what am I breaking\nWhat am I giving, what am I taking\nBut you try with your whole soul best\nNever to think these thoughts and never to let\nThem kind of thoughts gain ground\nOr make yer heart pound\nBut then again you know when theyre around\nJust waiting for a chance to slip and drop down\nCause sometimes you hearem when the night times comes creeping\nAnd you fear that they might catch you a-sleeping\nAnd you jump from yer bed, from yer last chapter of dreamin\nAnd you cant remember for the best of yer thinking\nIf that was you in the dream that was screaming\nAnd you know that its something special youre needin\nAnd you know that theres no drug thatll do for the healin\nAnd no liquor in the land to stop yer brain from bleeding\nAnd you need something special\nYeah, you need something special all right\nYou need a fast flying train on a tornado track\nTo shoot you someplace and shoot you back\nYou need a cyclone wind on a stream engine howler\nThats been banging and booming and blowing forever\nThat knows yer troubles a hundred times over\nYou need a Greyhound bus that dont bar no race\nThat wont laugh at yer looks\nYour voice or your face\nAnd by any number of bets in the book\nWill be rolling long after the bubblegum craze\nYou need something to open up a new door\nTo show you something you seen before\nBut overlooked a hundred times or more\nYou need something to open your eyes\nYou need something to make it known\nThat its you and no one else that owns\nThat spot that yer standing, that space that youre sitting\nThat the world aint got you beat\nThat it aint got you licked\nIt cant get you crazy no matter how many\nTimes you might get kicked\nYou need something special all right\nYou need something special to give you hope\nBut hopes just a word\nThat maybe you said or maybe you heard\nOn some windy corner round a wide-angled curve\nBut thats what you need man, and you need it bad\nAnd yer trouble is you know it too good\nCause you look an you start getting the chills\nCause you cant find it on a dollar bill\nAnd it aint on Macys window sill\nAnd it aint on no rich kids road map\nAnd it aint in no fat kids fraternity house\nAnd it aint made in no Hollywood wheat germ\nAnd it aint on that dimlit stage\nWith that half-wit comedian on it\nRanting and raving and taking yer money\nAnd you think its funny\nNo you cant find it in no night club or no yacht club\nAnd it aint in the seats of a supper club\nAnd sure as hell youre bound to tell\nThat no matter how hard you rub\nYou just aint a-gonna find it on yer ticket stub\nNo, and it aint in the rumors peoplere tellin you\nAnd it aint in the pimple-lotion people are sellin you\nAnd it aint in no cardboard-box house\nOr down any movie stars blouse\nAnd you cant find it on the golf course\nAnd Uncle Remus cant tell you and neither can Santa Claus\nAnd it aint in the cream puff hair-do or cotton candy clothes\nAnd it aint in the dime store dummies or bubblegum goons\nAnd it aint in the marshmallow noises of the chocolate cake voices\nThat come knockin and tappin in Christmas wrappin\nSayin aint I pretty and aint I cute and look at my skin\nLook at my skin shine, look at my skin glow\nLook at my skin laugh, look at my skin cry\nWhen you cant even sense if they got any insides\nThese people so pretty in their ribbons and bows\nNo youll not now or no other day\nFind it on the doorsteps made out-a paper mache\nAnd inside it the people made of molasses\nThat every other day buy a new pair of sunglasses\nAnd it aint in the fifty-star generals and flipped-out phonies\nWhod turn yuh in for a tenth of a penny\nWho breathe and burp and bend and crack\nAnd before you can count from one to ten\nDo it all over again but this time behind yer back\nMy friend\nThe ones that wheel and deal and whirl and twirl\nAnd play games with each other in their sand-box world\nAnd you cant find it either in the no-talent fools\nThat run around gallant\nAnd make all rules for the ones that got talent\nAnd it aint in the ones that aint got any talent but think they do\nAnd think theyre foolin you\nThe ones who jump on the wagon\nJust for a while cause they know its in style\nTo get their kicks, get out of it quick\nAnd make all kinds of money and chicks\nAnd you yell to yourself and you throw down yer hat\nSayin, Christ do I gotta be like that\nAint there no one here that knows where Im at\nAint there no one here that knows how I feel\nGood God Almighty\nTHAT STUFF AINT REAL\nNo but that aint yer game, it aint yer race\nYou cant hear yer name, you cant see yer face\nYou gotta look some other place\nAnd where do you look for this hope that yer seekin\nWhere do you look for this lamp thats a-burnin\nWhere do you look for this oil well gushin\nWhere do you look for this candle thats glowin\nWhere do you look for this hope that you know is there\nAnd out there somewhere\nAnd your feet can only walk down two kinds of roads\nYour eyes can only look through two kinds of windows\nYour nose can only smell two kinds of hallways\nYou can touch and twist\nAnd turn two kinds of doorknobs\nYou can either go to the church of your choice\nOr you can go to Brooklyn State Hospital\nYoull find God in the church of your choice\nYoull find Woody Guthrie in Brooklyn State Hospital\nAnd though its only my opinion\nI may be right or wrong\nYoull find them both\nIn the Grand Canyon\nAt sundown", "I dreamed I saw St. Augustine\nAlive as you

trembling\nAnd I must leave fast\nKing Kong, little elves\nIn the rooftoops they dance\nValentino-type tangos\nWhile the heros clean hands\nShut the eyes of the dead\nNot to embarrass anyone\nFarewell

a fawn\nI courted her proudly but now she is gone\nGone as the season shes taken\nIn a young summers youth, I stole her away\nFrom her mother and sister, though close did they stay\nEach one of them suffering from the failures of their day\nWith strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us\nOf the two sisters, I loved the young\nWith sensitive instincts, she was the creative one\nTheir constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone\nBy the jealousy of others around her\nFor her parasite sister, I had no respect\nBound by her boredom, her pride to protect\nCountless visions of the other shed reflect\nAs a crutch for her scenes and her society\nMyself, for what I did, I cannot be excused\nThe changes I was going through cant even be used\nFor the lies that I told her in hope not to lose\nThe could-be dream-lover of my lifetime\nWith unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip\nA magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped\nNoticing not that Id already slipped\nTo the sin of loves false security\nFrom silhouetted anger to manufactured peace\nAnswers of emptiness voice vacancies\nTil the tombstones of damage read no questions but please\nWhats wrong, whats exactly the matter?\nAnd so it did happen like it could have been foreseen\nThe timeless explosion of fantasys dream\nAt the peak of the night, the king and the queen\nTumbled all down into pieces\nThe tragic figure her sister did shout\nLeave her alone, God damn you, get out\nAnd I in my armor, turning about\nAnd nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness\nBeneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound\nHer sister and I in a screaming battleground\nAnd she in between, the victim of sound\nSoon shattered as a child to the shadows\nAll is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight\nI gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight\nMy mind it was mangled, I ran into the night\nLeaving all of loves ashes behind me\nThe wind knocks my window, the room it is wet\nThe words to say Im sorry, I havent found yet\nI think of her often and hope whoever shes met\nWill be fully aware of how precious she is\nAh, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me\nHow good, how good does it feel to be free?\nAnd I answer them most mysteriously\nAre birds free from the chains of the skyway?", "When the rains blowin in your face\nAnd the whole world is on your case\nI would offer you a warm embrace\nTo make you feel my love\nWhen the evenin shadows and the stars appear\nAnd there is no one to dry your tears\nI could hold you for a million years\nTo make you feel my love\nI know you havent made your mind up yet\nBut I would never do you wrong\nIve known it from the moment that we met\nIts no doubt in my mind where you belong\nId go hungry, Id go black and blue\nId go crawlin down the avenue\nThere aint nothin that I wouldnt do\nTo make you feel my love\nThe storms are ragin on the rollin sea\nDown on the highway of regret\nThe winds of change are blowin wild and free\nBut you aint seen nothin like me yet\nThere aint nothin that I wouldnt do\nGo to the ends of the earth for you\nMake you happy, make your dreams come true\nTo make you feel my... love", "Ive been a moonshiner\nFor seventeen long years\nIve spent all my money\nOn whiskey and beer\nI go to some hollow\nAnd sit at my still\nAnd if whiskey dont kill me\nThen I dont know what will\nI go to some bar room\nAnd drink with my friends\nWhere the women cant follow\nAnd see what I spend\nGod bless them pretty women\nI wish they was mine\nTheir breath is as sweet\nThe dew on the vine\nLet me eat when I am hungry\nLet me drink when I am dry\nA dollar when I am hard up\nReligion when I die\nThe whole worlds a bottle\nAnd lifes but a dram\nWhen the bottle gets empty\nIt sure aint worth a damn", "Oh, Im sailing away my own true love\nIm sailing away in the morning\nIs there something I can send you from across the sea?\nFrom the place where Ill be landing\nNo, theres nothing you can send me, my own true love\nTheres nothing Im wishing to be owning\nJust to carry yourself back to me unspoiled\nFrom across that lonesome ocean\nWell I just thought you might want something fine\nMade of silver or of golden\nEither from the mountains of Madrid\nOr from the coast of Barcelona\nAnd if I had the stars of the darkest night\nOr the diamonds from the deepest ocean\nId forsake them all for your sweet kiss\nFor thats all Im wishing to be owning\nAnd I might be gone a long old time\nAnd its only this Im asking\nIs there something I can send you to remember me by?\nTo make your time more easy passing\nOh how can, how can you ask me again?\nWhat only brings me sorrow\nThe same thing I would want today\nI would want again tomorrow\nI got a letter on a lonesome day\nIt was from her ship a-sailing\nSaying I dont know when Ill be coming back again\nIt depends on how Im feeling\nWell if you, my love, must think that way\nAnd Im sure your mind is roaming\nAnd Im sure your heart is not

this. But you know, they didnt get here by themselves. Its been a long road and its taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, theyre like mystery stories, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think theyre on the fringes now. And they sound like theyve been on the hard ground\nI should mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, great talent scout for Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, Im eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All noncommercial artists\nTrends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and thats all that mattered. I cant thank him enough for that\nLou Levy runs Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didnt stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like Stardust, hed turn it down because it would be too late\nHe told me that if I was before my time -- and he didnt really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didnt judge me, and Ill always remember him for that\nArtie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what Id give him next. I didnt even think of myself as a songwriter before then. Ill always be grateful for him also for that attitude\nI also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. Ive got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didnt even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldnt have happened to, or with, a better group\nThey took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I dont think that would have happened if it wasnt for them. They definitely started something for me\nThe Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasnt a pop songwriter and I really didnt want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of songs were like commercials, but I didnt really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad theyd done it\nPervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in 62 or 63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs\nNina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. These were the artists I looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she to me. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about\nOh, and cant forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didnt even sing. He was just the guitar player. He took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here\nJohnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, up in about 63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. Big River, I Walk the Line.\nHow highs the water, Mama? I wrote Its Alright Ma  with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, How high is the water, mama? Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing\nIn Johnny Cashs world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didnt exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or what not to sing. They just didnt do that kind of thing. Im always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And Ill always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days\nOh, and Id be remiss if I didnt mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice\nPeople would say, What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby little waif? And shed tell everybody in no uncertain terms, Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs. We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Love. And shes a free, independent spirit. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesnt want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman with devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back\nLRelated Rare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nPOP & HISS\nRare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nSEE ALL RELATED\n8\nGRAMMYS 2015: Complete list | Show highlights | Quotes | Best & worst\nThe secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylans new album\nThe secret Sinatra past of Bob Dylans new album\nThese songs didnt come out of thin air. I didnt just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock n roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music\nI learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything thats fair game, that everything belongs to everyone\nFor three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one song and sing it next in an hour if Id heard it just once\nIf you sang John Henry as many times as me -- John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man aint nothin but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / Ill die with that hammer in my hand.\nIf you had sung that song as many times as I did, youd have written How many roads must a man walk down? too\nBig Bill Broonzy had a song called Key to the Highway. Ive got a key to the highway / Im booked and Im bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin because walking is most too slow. I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write\nGeorgia Sam he had a bloody nose\nWelfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes\nHe asked poor Howard where can I go\nHoward said there’s only one place I know\nSam said tell me quick man I got to run\nHoward just pointed with his gun\nAnd said that way down on Highway 61\nYoud have written that too if youd sang Key to the Highway as much as me\nAint no use sit n cry / Youll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away. Im sailing away my own true love. Boots of Spanish Leather -- Sheryl Crow just sung that\nRoll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white mans pay / A dollar a day is the black mans pay / Roll the cotton down. If you sang that song as many times as me, youd be writing I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more, too\nI sang a lot of come all you songs. Theres plenty of them. Theres way too many to be counted. Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my trouble on the old Chisholm Trail. Or, Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins a lad we all know well / The fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.\nCome all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / Theyre like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then theyre gone again. If youll gather round, people / A story I will tell / Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, an outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.\nIf you sung all these come all ye songs all the time, youd be writing, Come gather round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon youll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or youll sink like a stone / The times they are a-changing.\nYoud have written them too. Theres nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because thats all enough, and thats all I sang. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense\nWhen you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women in Deep Ellum put you on the rocks. Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, When youre lost in the rain in Juarez and its Easter time too / And your gravity fails and negativity dont pull you through / Don’t put on any airs / When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you.\nAll these songs are connected. Dont be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. Its just different, saying the same thing. I didnt think it was anything out of the ordinary\nWell you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didnt know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway\nLast thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didnt think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down. Youve just got to bear it. I didnt really care what Lieber and Stoller thought of my songs\nThey didnt like em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didnt like em, because I never liked their songs either. Yakety yak, dont talk back. Charlie Brown is a clown, Baby Im a hog for you. Novelty songs. They werent saying anything serious. Docs songs, they were better. This Magic Moment. Lonely Avenue. Save the Last Dance for Me\nThose songs broke my heart. I figured Id rather have his blessings any day than theirs\nAhmet Ertegun didnt think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ray Brown, just to name a few\nThere were some great records in there, no question about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical eyes that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolution in style and scope. Heavy shape and color. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, Id rather have Sam Phillips blessing any day\nMerle Haggard didnt even think much of my songs. I know he didnt. He didnt say that to me, but I know . Buck Owens did, and he recorded some of my early songs. Merle Haggard -- Mama Tried, The Bottle Let Me Down, Im a Lonesome Fugitive. I cant imagine Waylon Jennings singing The Bottle Let Me Down.\nTogether Again? Thats Buck Owens, and that trumps anything coming out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebodys blessing -- you figure it out\nOh, yeah. Critics have been giving me a hard time since Day One. Critics say I cant sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why dont critics say that same thing about Tom Waits? Critics say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. What dont they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I cant carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? Ive never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free?\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or woe is me the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when Im finished thinking I have to die a lot Theres torture and theres killing And theres all my bad reviews The war,...\nWhat have I done to deserve this special attention? No vocal range? Whens the last time you heard Dr. John? Why dont you say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. Have you people ever listened to Charley Patton or Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters. Talk about slurred words and no diction. doesnt even matter\nWhy me, Lord? I would say that to myself\nCritics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving\nAfter that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note -- that exists, and some that dont exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a one-syllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was on a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny\nWhere were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I dont really think I do that. I just think critics say I do\nSam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, Well thats very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth. Think about that the next time you \nTimes always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something thats coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldnt understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about\nNow Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called Country Road. Tom was going off in this interview -- But James dont say nothing about a country road. Hes just says how you can feel it on the country road. I dont understand that.\nNow some might say Tom is a great songwriter. Im not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio\nIt was called I Love. I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that hes just like you and youre just like him. We all love the same things, and were all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleeping without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions\nNow listen, Im not ever going to disparage another songwriter. Im not going to do that. Im not saying its a bad song. Im just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing\nThis was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. Hes still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they aint seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat, flew his helicopter into Johnny Cashs backyard like a typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. Sunday Morning Coming Down.\nWell, I woke up Sunday morning\nGrammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King\nGrammys 2014: MusiCares gala celebrates the music of Carole King\nWith no way to hold my head that didnt hurt\nAnd the beer I had for breakfast wasnt bad\nSo I had one more for dessert\nThen I fumbled through my closet\nFound my cleanest dirty shirt\nThen I washed my face and combed my hair\nAnd stumbled down the stairs to meet the day\nYou can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song ruined Tom T. Halls poker parties. It might have sent him to the crazy house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs\nYou walk into the room\nWith your pencil in your hand\nYou see somebody naked\nYou say, “Who is that man?”\nYou try so hard\nBut you don’t understand\nJust what youre gonna say\nWhen you get home\nYou know something is happening here\nBut you don’t know what it is\nLRelated Rare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nPOP & HISS\nRare, unusual Beatles and Rolling Stones photos surface via eBay sale\nSEE ALL RELATED\n8\nDo you, Mister Jones?\nIf Sunday Morning Coming Down rattled Toms cage, sent him into the looney bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the minivan. Hopefully he didnt hear it\nI just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilsons done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done em. But the reviews of their records are different than the reviews of my record\nIn their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, theyve got to look under every stone when it comes to me. Theyve got to mention all the songwriters names. Well thats OK with me. After all, theyre great songwriters and these are standards. Ive seen the reviews come in, and theyll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobodys heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few\nCComments\n@studiocity2 Yep.

Im glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but theyre finally there. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that theyre not here to see it\nTraditional rock n roll, were talking about that. Its all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues. Very few rock n roll bands today play with rhythm. They dont know what it is. Rock n roll is a combination of blues, and its a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people dont know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. Its a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But its true\nThe other half of rock n roll has got to be hillbilly. And thats a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. Thats a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Clarence Ashley ... groups like that. Moonshiners gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. Thats the kind of combination that makes up rock n roll, and it cant be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio\nYou have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you cant hardly play the blues, how do you those other two kinds of music in there? You can fake it, but you cant really do it\nCritics have made a career out of accusing me of having a career of confounding expectations. Really? Because thats all I do. Thats how I think about it. Confounding expectations\nWhat do you do for a living, man?\nOh, I confound expectations.\nYoure going to get a job, the man says, What do you do? Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or dont call us, well call you. Confounding expectations. What does that mean? Why me, Lord? Id confound them, but I dont know how to do it.\nThe Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldnt. Of course it would be a gospel album. I dont think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs Im thinking about singing is Stand By Me by the Blackwood Brothers. Not Stand By Me the pop song. No. The real Stand By Me.\nThe real one goes like this:\nWhen the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me\nIn the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou who never lost a battle / Stand by me\nIn the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends dont understand / Thou who knowest all about me / Stand by me\nThats the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, thats going to be the one. Im also thinking of recording a song, not on that album, though: Oh Lord, Please Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood.\nAnyway, why me, Lord. What did I do?\nAnyway, Im proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. Im honored to have all these artists singing my songs. Theres nothing like that. Great artists. . Theyre all singing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices\nIm proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. Theyve helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. Id like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldnt work. Billy was a son of rock n roll, obviously\nHe was a true original. He did it all: He played, he sang, he wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You just dont stand a chance\nSo Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one-hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star whos got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billys hit song was called Red Hot, and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life\nHe did it with style and grace. You wont find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Hes not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know theyre in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- Ive got nothing against them. Soft rock, hard rock, psychedelic pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff, but after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet\nId see him a couple times a year and wed always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and wed cross paths now and again. Wed always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. Id heard Red Hot. I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and its impressed me to this day\nYep. A more gracious way to lament or woe is me the bad reviews: I have to die a little Between each murderous thought And when Im finished thinking I have to die a lot Theres torture and theres killing And theres all my bad reviews The war,...\nI never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasnt bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was\nAnd then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you dont get better. Thats from a song of his called Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days. Its one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I aint lying\nAnd I aint lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friends doctor bills, and helped him to get spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that cant be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing\nIm going to get out of here now. Im going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But thats OK. Like the spiritual song, Im still just crossing over Jordan too. Lets hope we meet again. Sometime.

Neil Portnow, Dana Tamarkin, Rob Light, Brian Greenbaum, Don Was. And also want to thank President Carter for coming. It’s been a long night, and I don’t want to talk too much, but I’ll say a few things. Im glad for my songs to be honored like this. But you know, they didnt get here by themselves. Its been a long road and its taken a lot of doing. These songs of mine, I think of as mystery plays, the kind that Shakespeare saw when he was growing up. I think you could trace what I do back that far. They were on the fringes then, and I think theyre on the fringes now. And they sound like theyve been traveling on hard ground. I need to mention a few people along the way who brought this about. I know I should mention John Hammond, the great talent scout, who way back when brought me to Columbia Records. He signed me to that label when I was nobody. It took a lot of faith to do that, and he took a lot of ridicule, but he was his own man and he was courageous. And for that, Im eternally grateful. The last person he discovered before me was Aretha Franklin, and before that Count Basie, Billie Holiday and a whole lot of other artists. All non-commercial artists. Trends did not interest John, and I was very noncommercial but he stayed with me. He believed in my talent and thats all that mattered. I cant thank him enough for that. Lou Levy ran Leeds Music, and they published my earliest songs, but I didnt stay there too long. Levy himself, he went back a long ways. He signed me to that company and recorded my songs and I sang them into a tape recorder. He told me outright, there was no precedent for what I was doing, that I was either before my time or behind it. And if I brought him a song like Stardust, hed turn it down because it would be too late. He told me that if I was before my time -- and he didnt really know that for sure -- but if it was happening and if it was true, the public would usually take three to five years to catch up -- so be prepared. And that did happen. The trouble was, when the public did catch up I was already three to five years beyond that, so it kind of complicated it. But he was encouraging, and he didnt judge me, and Ill always remember him for that. Artie Mogull at Witmark Music signed me next to his company, and he told me to just keep writing songs no matter what, that I might be on to something. Well, he too stood behind me, and he could never wait to see what Id give him next. I didnt even think of myself as a songwriter before then. Ill always be grateful for him also for that attitude.I also have to mention some of the early artists who recorded my songs very, very early, without having to be asked. Just something they felt about them that was right for them. Ive got to say thank you to Peter, Paul and Mary, who I knew all separately before they ever became a group. I didnt even think of myself as writing songs for others to sing but it was starting to happen and it couldnt have happened to, or with, a better group. They took a song of mine that had been recorded before that was buried on one of my records and turned it into a hit song. Not the way I would have done it -- they straightened it out. But since then hundreds of people have recorded it and I dont think that would have happened if it wasnt for them. They definitely started something for me. The Byrds, the Turtles, Sonny & Cher -- they made some of my songs Top 10 hits but I wasnt a pop songwriter and I really didnt want to be that, but it was good that it happened. Their versions of my songs were like commercials, but I didnt really mind that because 50 years later my songs were being used in the commercials. So that was good too. I was glad it happened, and I was glad theyd done it. Pervis Staples and the Staple Singers -- long before they were on Stax they were on Epic and they were one of my favorite groups of all time. I met them all in 62 or 63. They heard my songs live and Pervis wanted to record three or four of them and he did with the Staples Singers. They were the type of artists that I wanted recording my songs, if anybody was going to do it. Nina Simone. I used to cross paths with her in New York City in the Village Gate nightclub. She was an artist a definitely looked up to. She recorded some of my songs that she learned directly from me, sitting in a dressing room. She was an overwhelming artist, piano player and singer. Very strong woman, very outspoken and dynamite to see perform. That she was recording my songs validated everything that I was about. Nina was the kind of artist that I loved and admired. Oh, and cant forget Jimi Hendrix. I actually saw Jimi Hendrix perform when he was in a band called Jimmy James and the Blue Flames -- something like that. And Jimi didnt even sing. He was just the guitar player. After he became famous, he took some small songs of mine that nobody paid any attention to and pumped them up into the outer limits of the stratosphere and turned them all into classics. I have to thank Jimi, too. I wish he was here. Johnny Cash recorded some of my songs early on, too, I met him in about 63, when he was all skin and bones. He traveled long, he traveled hard, but he was a hero of mine. I heard many of his songs growing up. I knew them better than I knew my own. Big River, I Walk the Line. How High’s The Water, Mama? I wrote Its Alright Ma  with that song reverberating inside my head. I still ask, How high is the water, mama? Johnny was an intense character. And he saw that people were putting me down playing electric music, and he posted letters to magazines scolding people, telling them to shut up and let him sing. In Johnny Cashs world -- hardcore Southern drama -- that kind of thing didnt exist. Nobody told anybody what to sing or do. They just didnt do that kind of thing where he came from. Im always going to thank him for that. Johnny Cash was a giant of a man, the man in black. And Ill always cherish the friendship we had until the day there is no more days. Oh, and Id be remiss if I didnt mention Joan Baez. She was the queen of folk music then and now. She took a liking to my songs and brought me with her to play concerts, where she had crowds of thousands of people enthralled with her beauty and voice. People would say, What are you doing with that ragtag scrubby looking waif? And shed tell everybody in no uncertain terms, Now you better be quiet and listen to the songs. We even played a few of them together. Joan Baez is as tough-minded as they come. Loyal, free minded and fiercely independent. Nobody can tell her what to do if she doesnt want to do it. I learned a lot of things from her. A woman of devastating honesty. And for her kind of love and devotion, I could never pay that back. These songs didnt come out of thin air. I didnt just make them up out of whole cloth. Contrary to what Lou Levy said, there was a precedent. It all came out of traditional music: traditional folk music, traditional rock n roll and traditional big-band swing orchestra music. I learned lyrics and how to write them from listening to folk songs. And I played them, and I met other people that played them, back when nobody was doing it. Sang nothing but these folk songs, and they gave me the code for everything thats fair game, that everything belongs to everyone. For three or four years all I listened to were folk standards. I went to sleep singing folk songs. I sang them everywhere, clubs, parties, bars, coffeehouses, fields, festivals. And I met other singers along the way who did the same thing and we just learned songs from each other. I could learn one song and sing it next in an hour if Id heard it just once. If you sang John Henry as many times as me -- John Henry was a steel-driving man / Died with a hammer in his hand / John Henry said a man aint nothin but a man / Before I let that steam drill drive me down / Ill die with that hammer in my hand.If you had sung that song as many times as I did, youd have written How many roads must a man walk down? too. Big Bill Broonzy had a song called Key to the Highway. Ive got a key to the highway / Im booked and Im bound to go / Gonna leave here runnin because walking is most too slow. I sang that a lot. If you sing that a lot, you just might write, Georgia Sam he had a bloody nose Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes He asked poor Howard where can I go Howard said there’s only one place I know Sam said tell me quick man I got to run Howard just pointed with his gun And said that way down on Highway 61 Youd have written that too if youd sang Key to the Highway as much as me. Aint no use sit n cry / Youll be an angel by and by / Sail away, ladies, sail away. Im sailing away my own true love. Boots of Spanish Leather -- Sheryl Crow just sung that. Roll the cotton down, aw, yeah, roll the cotton down / Ten dollars a day is a white mans pay / Roll the cotton down/A dollar a day is the black mans pay / Roll the cotton down. If you sang that song as many times as me, youd be writing I aint gonna work on Maggies farm no more, too. If you’d had listened to the Robert Johnson singing, “Better come in my kitchen, ‘cause it’s gonna be raining out doors,” as many time as I listened to it, sometime later you just might write, “A Hard Rain’s a-Gonna Fall.” I sang a lot of come all you songs. Theres plenty of them. Theres way too many to be counted. Come along boys and listen to my tale / Tell you of my troubles on the old Chisholm Trail. Or, Come all ye good people, listen while I tell / the fate of Floyd Collins, a lad we all know well.” Come all ye fair and tender ladies / Take warning how you court your men / Theyre like a star on a summer morning / They first appear and then theyre gone again. And then there’s this one, Gather round, people / A story I will tell / Bout Pretty Boy Floyd, the outlaw / Oklahoma knew him well.If you sung all these come all ye songs all the time like I did, youd be writing, Come gather round people where ever you roam, admit that the waters around you have grown / Accept that soon youll be drenched to the bone / If your time to you is worth saving / And you better start swimming or youll sink like a stone / The times they are achanging. Youd have written that too. Theres nothing secret about it. You just do it subliminally and unconsciously, because thats all enough, and thats all you know. That was all that was dear to me. They were the only kinds of songs that made sense. When you go down to Deep Ellum keep your money in your socks / Women on Deep Ellum put you on the rocks. Sing that song for a while and you just might come up with, When youre lost in the rain in Juarez and its Easter time too / And your gravity’s down and negativity dont pull you through / Don’t put on any airs / When you’re down on Rue Morgue Avenue / They got some hungry women there / And they really make a mess outta you. All these songs are connected. Dont be fooled. I just opened up a different door in a different kind of way. Its just different, saying the same thing. I didnt think it was anything out of the ordinary. Well you know, I just thought I was doing something natural, but right from the start, my songs were divisive for some reason. They divided people. I never knew why. Some got angered, others loved them. Didnt know why my songs had detractors and supporters. A strange environment to have to throw your songs into, but I did it anyway. Last thing I thought of was who cared about what song I was writing. I was just writing them. I didnt think I was doing anything different. I thought I was just extending the line. Maybe a little bit unruly, but I was just elaborating on situations. Maybe hard to pin down, but so what? A lot of people are hard to pin down and you’ve just got to bear it. In a sense everything evened itself out. Leiber and Stoller didn’t think much of my songs. They didnt like em, but Doc Pomus did. That was all right that they didnt like em, because I never liked their songs either. Yakety yak, dont talk back. Charlie Brown is a clown, Baby Im a hog for you. Novelty songs, not serious. Docs songs, they were better. This Magic Moment. Lonely Avenue. “Save the Last Dance for Me.” Those songs broke my heart. I figured Id rather have his blessings any day than theirs. Ahmet Ertegun didnt think much of my songs, but Sam Phillips did. Ahmet founded Atlantic Records. He produced some great records: Ray Charles, Ruth Brown, LaVerne Baker, just to name a few. There were some great records in there, no doubt about it. But Sam Phillips, he recorded Elvis and Jerry Lee, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. Radical artists that shook the very essence of humanity. Revolutionaries with vision and foresight. Fearless and sensitive at the same time. Revolution in style and scope. Radical to the bone. Songs that cut you to the bone. Renegades in all degrees, doing songs that would never decay, and still resound to this day. Oh, yeah, Id rather have Sam Phillips blessing any day. Merle Haggard didnt think much of my songs, but Buck Owens did, and Buck even recorded some of my early songs. Now I admire Merle -- Mama Tried, Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down, Im a Lonesome Fugitive. I understand all that but I cant imagine Waylon Jennings singing The Bottle Let Me Down. I love Merle but he’s not Buck. Buck Owens wrote Together Again and that song trumps anything that ever came out of Bakersfield. Buck Owens and Merle Haggard? If you have to have somebodys blessing -- you figure it out. What I’m saying here is that my songs seem to divide people. Even people in the music community. People in the critical world too. Critics have always been on my tail since day one. Seems like they’ve always given me special treatment. Some of the music critics say I cant sing. I croak. Sound like a frog. Why dont these same critics say similar things about Tom Waits? They say my voice is shot. That I have no voice. Why dont they say those things about Leonard Cohen? Why do I get special treatment? Critics say I cant carry a tune and I talk my way through a song. Really? Ive never heard that said about Lou Reed. Why does he get to go scot-free? What have I done to deserve this special treatment? Why me lord? No vocal range? Whens the last time you’ve read that about Dr. John? You’ve never read that about Dr John. Why dont they say that about him? Slur my words, got no diction. You have to wonder if these critics have ever heard Charley Patton or Son House or Wolf. Talk about slurred words and no diction. Why don’t they say those same things about them. Why me, Lord? Critics say I mangle my melodies, render my songs unrecognizable. Oh, really? Let me tell you something. I was at a boxing match a few years ago seeing Floyd Mayweather fight a Puerto Rican guy. And the Puerto Rican national anthem, somebody sang it and it was beautiful. It was heartfelt and it was moving. After that it was time for our national anthem. And a very popular soul-singing sister was chosen to sing. She sang every note - - that exists, and some that dont exist. Talk about mangling a melody. You take a onesyllable word and make it last for 15 minutes? She was doing vocal gymnastics like she was a trapeze act. But to me it was not funny.Where were the critics? Mangling lyrics? Mangling a melody? Mangling a treasured song? No, I get the blame. But I dont really think I do that. I just think critics say I do. Sam Cooke said this when told he had a beautiful voice: He said, Well thats very kind of you, but voices ought not to be measured by how pretty they are. Instead they matter only if they convince you that they are telling the truth. Think about that the next time you are listening to a singer. Times always change. They really do. And you have to always be ready for something thats coming along and you never expected it. Way back when, I was in Nashville making some records and I read this article, a Tom T. Hall interview. Tom T. Hall, he was bitching about some kind of new song, and he couldnt understand what these new kinds of songs that were coming in were about. Now Tom, he was one of the most preeminent songwriters of the time in Nashville. A lot of people were recording his songs and he himself even did it. But he was all in a fuss about James Taylor, a song James had called Country Road. Tom was going off in this interview -- But James dont say nothing about a country road. Hes just says how you can feel it on the country road. I dont understand that. Now some might say Tom is a great songwriter. Im not going to doubt that. At the time he was doing this interview I was actually listening to a song of his on the radio. It was called I Love. I was listening to it in a recording studio, and he was talking about all the things he loves, an everyman kind of song, trying to connect with people. Trying to make you think that hes just like you and youre just like him. We all love the same things, and were all in this together. Tom loves little baby ducks, slow-moving trains and rain. He loves old pickup trucks and little country streams. Sleep without dreams. Bourbon in a glass. Coffee in a cup. Tomatoes on the vine, and onions. Now listen, Im not ever going to disparage another songwriter. Im not going to do that. Im not saying its a bad song. Im just saying it might be a little overcooked. But, you know, it was in the top 10 anyway. Tom and a few other writers had the whole Nashville scene sewed up in a box. If you wanted to record a song and get it in the top 10 you had to go to them, and Tom was one of the top guys. They were all very comfortable, doing their thing. This was about the time that Willie Nelson picked up and moved to Texas. About the same time. Hes still in Texas. Everything was very copacetic. Everything was all right until -- until -- Kristofferson came to town. Oh, they aint seen anybody like him. He came into town like a wildcat that he was, flew a helicopter into Johnny Cashsbackyard, not your typical songwriter. And he went for the throat. Sunday Morning Coming Down. Well, I woke up Sunday morning With no way to hold my head that didnt hurt. And the beer I had for breakfast wasnt bad So I had one more for dessert Then I fumbled through my closet Found my cleanest dirty shirt Then I washed my face and combed my hair And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day. You can look at Nashville pre-Kris and post-Kris, because he changed everything. That one song blew ol’ Tom T. Halls world apart. He couldn’t see it coming. It might have sent him to the mad house. God forbid he ever heard any of my songs. You walk into the room With your pencil in your hand You see somebody naked You say, “Who is that man?” You try so hard But you don’t understand Just what youre gonna say When you get home But you don’t know what it is Do you, Mister Jones? If Sunday Morning Coming Down rattled Toms cage, sent him into the loony bin, my song surely would have made him blow his brains out, right there in the loony bin. Hopefully he didnt hear it.I just released an album of standards, all the songs usually done by Michael Buble, Harry Connick Jr., maybe Brian Wilsons done a couple, Linda Ronstadt done em. Rod of course, even Paul has done some of this kind of material. But the reviews of their records aren’t like mine. In their reviews no one says anything. In my reviews, theyve got to look under every stone and report about it. In the review they get, you seldom see any of the songwriters names. Unlike mine. Theyve got to mention all the songwriters names. Well thats OK with me. After all, theyre great songwriters and these are standards. Ive seen the reviews come in, and theyll mention all the songwriters in half the review, as if everybody knows them. Nobodys heard of them, not in this time, anyway. Buddy Kaye, Cy Coleman, Carolyn Leigh, to name a few. But, you know, Im glad they mention their names, and you know what? Im glad they got their names in the press. It might have taken some time to do it, but theyre finally there with importance and dignity. I can only wonder why it took so long. My only regret is that theyre not here to see it. Traditional rock n roll, were talking about that. Its all about rhythm. Johnny Cash said it best: Get rhythm. Get rhythm when you get the blues. Very few rock n roll bands today play with rhythm. They dont know what it is. Rock n roll is a combination of blues, and its a strange thing made up of two parts. A lot of people dont know this, but the blues, which is an American music, is not what you think it is. Its a combination of Arabic violins and Strauss waltzes working it out. But its true. The other half of rock n roll has got to be hillbilly. And thats a derogatory term, but it ought not to be. Thats a term that includes the Delmore Bros., Stanley Bros., Roscoe Holcomb, Git Tanner and the Skillet Lickers ... groups like that. Moonshine gone berserk. Fast cars on dirt roads. Thats the kind of combination that makes up rock n roll, and it cant be cooked up in a science laboratory or a studio. You have to have the right kind of rhythm to play this kind of music. If you cant hardly play the blues, and you don’t have the hillbilly feeling, you’re not really playing Rock n Roll. It might be something else but it’s not that. You can fake it, but you cant make it. Critics have said that I’ve made a career out of confounding expectations. Really? Because thats all I do? Thats how I think about it. Confounding expectations. Like I stay up late at night thinking about how to do it. What do you do for a living, man? Oh, I confound expectations. Youre going to get a job, the man says, What do you do? Oh, confound expectations.: And the man says, Well, we already have that spot filled. Call us back. Or dont call us, well call you. Confounding expectations. I don’t even know what that means or who has time for it.‘Why me, Lord? My work confounds them obviously, but I really dont know how I do it. The Blackwood Bros. have been talking to me about making a record together. That might confound expectations, but it shouldnt. Of course it would be a gospel album. I dont think it would be anything out of the ordinary for me. Not a bit. One of the songs Im thinking about singing is Stand By Me with the Blackwood Brothers. Not Stand By Me the pop song. No. The real Stand By Me. The real one goes like this: When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the storm of life is raging / Stand by me / When the world is tossing me / Like a ship upon the sea / Thou who rulest wind and water / Stand by me In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / In the midst of tribulation / Stand by me / When the hosts of hell assail / And my strength begins to fail / Thou whomever lost a battle / Stand by me In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / In the midst of faults and failures / Stand by me / When I do the best I can / And my friends dont understand/ Thou who knowest all about me / Stand by me Thats the song. I like it better than the pop song. If I record one by that name, thats going to be the one. Im also thinking of recording a song, not for that album, though – a song called Oh Lord, Please Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood. But I don’t know, it might be good on the gospel album too. Anyway, Im proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. Im honored to have all these artists singing my songs. Theres nothing like that. Great artists. Who all know how to sing the truth, and you can hear it in their voices. Im proud to be here tonight for MusiCares. I think a lot of this organization. Theyve helped many people. Many musicians who have contributed a lot to our culture. Id like to personally thank them for what they did for a friend of mine, Billy Lee Riley. A friend of mine who they helped for six years when he was down and couldnt work. Billy was a Sun rock n roll artist. He was a true original. He did it all; played, sang and wrote. He would have been a bigger star but Jerry Lee came along. And you know what happens when someone like that comes along. You kind of have to take a step back. You just dont stand a chance. So Billy became what is known in the industry -- a condescending term, by the way -- as a one-hit wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, once in a while, a one hit wonder can make a more powerful impact than a recording star whos got 20 or 30 hits behind him. And Billys hit song was called Red Hot, and it was red hot. It could blast you out of your skull and make you feel happy about it. Change your life. He did it with power and style and grace. You wont find him in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Hes not there. Metallica is. Abba is. Mamas and the Papas -- I know theyre in there. Jefferson Airplane, Alice Cooper, Steely Dan -- Ive got nothing against Metal, Soft Rock, Hard Rock, Psychedelic Pop. I got nothing against any of that stuff. But after all, it is called the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Billy Lee Riley is not there. Yet. And it’s taking too long. Id see him a couple times a year and wed always spent time together and he was on a rockabilly festival nostalgia circuit, and wed cross paths now and again. Wed always spend time together. He was a hero of mine. Id heard Red Hot. I must have been only 15 or 16 when I did and its impressed me to this day. I never grow tired of listening to it. Never got tired of watching Billy Lee perform, either. We spent time together just talking and playing into the night. He was a deep, truthful man. He wasnt bitter or nostalgic. He just accepted it. He knew where he had come from and he was content with who he was. And then one day he got sick. And like my friend John Mellencamp would sing -- because John sang some truth today -- one day you get sick and you dont get better. Thats from a song of his called Life is Short Even on Its Longest Days. Its one of the better songs of the last few years, actually. I aint lying. And I aint lying when I tell you that MusiCares paid for my friends doctor bills, mortgage and gave him spending money. They were able to at least make his life comfortable, tolerable to the end. That is something that cant be repaid. Any organization that would do that would have to have my blessing. Im going to get out of here now. Im going to put an egg in my shoe and beat it. I probably left out a lot of people and said too much about some. But thats OK. Like the spiritual song, Im still just crossing over Jordan too. Lets hope we meet again. Sometime. And we will, if, like Hank Williams says, the good Lord willing and the creek dont rise.”", "How many roads must a man walk down\nBefore hes called a man?\nHow many seas must the white dove

songs related to literature. I wanted to reflect on it and see where the connection was. Im going to try to articulate that to you. And most likely it will go in a roundabout way, but I hope what I say will be worthwhile and purposeful.\nIf I was to go back to the dawning of it all, I guess Id have to start with Buddy Holly. Buddy died when I was about eighteen and he was twenty-two. From the moment I first heard him, I felt akin. I felt related, like he was an older brother. I even thought I resembled him. Buddy played the music that I loved – the music I grew up on: country western, rock ‘n roll, and rhythm and blues. Three separate strands of music that he intertwined and infused into one genre. One brand. And Buddy wrote songs – songs that had beautiful melodies and imaginative verses. And he sang great – sang in more than a few voices. He was the archetype. Everything I wasnt and wanted to be. I saw him only but once, and that was a few days before he was gone. I had to travel a hundred miles to get to see him play, and I wasnt disappointed.\nHe was powerful and electrifying and had a commanding presence. I was only six feet away. He was mesmerizing. I watched his face, his hands, the way he tapped his foot, his big black glasses, the eyes behind the glasses, the way he held his guitar, the way he stood, his neat suit. Everything about him. He looked older than twenty-two. Something about him seemed permanent, and he filled me with conviction. Then, out of the blue, the most uncanny thing happened. He looked me right straight dead in the eye, and he transmitted something. Something I didnt know what. And it gave me the chills.\nI think it was a day or two after that that his plane went down. And somebody – somebody Id never seen before – handed me a Leadbelly record with the song Cottonfields on it. And that record changed my life right then and there. Transported me into a world Id never known. It was like an explosion went off. Like Id been walking in darkness and all of the sudden the darkness was illuminated. It was like somebody laid hands on me. I must have played that record a hundred times.\nIt was on a label Id never heard of with a booklet inside with advertisements for other artists on the label: Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, the New Lost City Ramblers, Jean Ritchie, string bands. Id never heard of any of them. But I reckoned if they were on this label with Leadbelly, they had to be good, so I needed to hear them. I wanted to know all about it and play that kind of music. I still had a feeling for the music Id grown up with, but for right now, I forgot about it. Didnt even think about it. For the time being, it was long gone.\nI hadnt left home yet, but I couldnt wait to. I wanted to learn this music and meet the people who played it. Eventually, I did leave, and I did learn to play those songs. They were different than the radio songs that Id been listening to all along. They were more vibrant and truthful to life. With radio songs, a performer might get a hit with a roll of the dice or a fall of the cards, but that didnt matter in the folk world. Everything was a hit. All you had to do was be well versed and be able to play the melody. Some of these songs were easy, some not. I had a natural feeling for the ancient ballads and country blues, but everything else I had to learn from scratch. I was playing for small crowds, sometimes no more than four or five people in a room or on a street corner. You had to have a wide repertoire, and you had to know what to play and when. Some songs were intimate, some you had to shout to be heard.\nBy listening to all the early folk artists and singing the songs yourself, you pick up the vernacular. You internalize it. You sing it in the ragtime blues, work songs, Georgia sea shanties, Appalachian ballads and cowboy songs. You hear all the finer points, and you learn the details.\nYou know what its all about. Takin the pistol out and puttin it back in your pocket. Whippin your way through traffic, talkin in the dark. You know that Stagger Lee was a bad man and that Frankie was a good girl. You know that Washington is a bourgeois town and youve heard the deep-pitched voice of John the Revelator and you saw the Titanic sink in a boggy creek. And youre pals with the wild Irish rover and the wild colonial boy. You heard the muffled drums and the fifes that played lowly. Youve seen the lusty Lord Donald stick a knife in his wife, and a lot of your comrades have been wrapped in white linen.\nI had all the vernacular down. I knew the rhetoric. None of it went over my head – the devices, the techniques, the secrets, the mysteries – and I knew all the deserted roads that it traveled on, too. I could make it all connect and move with the current of the day. When I started writing my own songs, the folk lingo was the only vocabulary that I knew, and I used it.\nBut I had something else as well. I had principles and sensibilities and an informed view of the world. And I had had that for a while. Learned it all in grammar school. Don Quixote, Ivanhoe, Robinson Crusoe, Gullivers Travels, Tale of Two Cities, all the rest – typical grammar school reading that gave you a way of looking at life, an understanding of human nature, and a standard to measure things by. I took all that with me when I started composing lyrics. And the themes from those books worked their way into many of my songs, either knowingly or unintentionally. I wanted to write songs unlike anything anybody ever heard, and these themes were fundamental.\nSpecific books that have stuck with me ever since I read them way back in grammar school – I want to tell you about three of them: Moby Dick, All Quiet on the Western Front and The Odyssey.\nMoby Dick is a fascinating book, a book thats filled with scenes of high drama and dramatic dialogue. The book makes demands on you. The plot is straightforward. The mysterious Captain Ahab – captain of a ship called the Pequod – an egomaniac with a peg leg pursuing his nemesis, the great white whale Moby Dick who took his leg. And he pursues him all the way from the Atlantic around the tip of Africa and into the Indian Ocean. He pursues the whale around both sides of the earth. Its an abstract goal, nothing concrete or definite. He calls Moby the emperor, sees him as the embodiment of evil. Ahabs got a wife and child back in Nantucket that he reminisces about now and again. You can anticipate what will happen.\nThe ships crew is made up of men of different races, and any one of them who sights the whale will be given the reward of a gold coin. A lot of Zodiac symbols, religious allegory, stereotypes. Ahab encounters other whaling vessels, presses the captains for details about Moby. Have they seen him? Theres a crazy prophet, Gabriel, on one of the vessels, and he predicts Ahabs doom. Says Moby is the incarnate of a Shaker god, and that any dealings with him will lead to disaster. He says that to Captain Ahab. Another ships captain – Captain Boomer – he lost an arm to Moby. But he tolerates that, and hes happy to have survived. He cant accept Ahabs lust for vengeance.\nThis book tells how different men react in different ways to the same experience. A lot of Old Testament, biblical allegory: Gabriel, Rachel, Jeroboam, Bildah, Elijah. Pagan names as well: Tashtego, Flask, Daggoo, Fleece, Starbuck, Stubb, Marthas Vineyard. The Pagans are idol worshippers. Some worship little wax figures, some wooden figures. Some worship fire. The Pequod is the name of an Indian tribe.\nMoby Dick is a seafaring tale. One of the men, the narrator, says, Call me Ishmael. Somebody asks him where hes from, and he says, Its not down on any map. True places never are. Stubb gives no significance to anything, says everything is predestined. Ishmaels been on a sailing ship his entire life. Calls the sailing ships his Harvard and Yale. He keeps his distance from people.\nA typhoon hits the Pequod. Captain Ahab thinks its a good omen. Starbuck thinks its a bad omen, considers killing Ahab. As soon as the storm ends, a crewmember falls from the ships mast and drowns, foreshadowing whats to come. A Quaker pacifist priest, who is actually a bloodthirsty businessman, tells Flask, Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness.\nEverything is mixed in. All the myths: the Judeo Christian bible, Hindu myths, British legends, Saint George, Perseus, Hercules – theyre all whalers. Greek mythology, the gory business of cutting up a whale. Lots of facts in this book, geographical knowledge, whale oil – good for coronation of royalty – noble families in the whaling industry. Whale oil is used to anoint the kings. History of the whale, phrenology, classical philosophy, pseudo-scientific theories, justification for discrimination – everything thrown in and none of it hardly rational. Highbrow, lowbrow, chasing illusion, chasing death, the great white whale, white as polar bear, white as a white man, the emperor, the nemesis, the embodiment of evil. The demented captain who actually lost his leg years ago trying to attack Moby with a knife.\nWe see only the surface of things. We can interpret what lies below any way we see fit. Crewmen walk around on deck listening for mermaids, and sharks and vultures follow the ship. Reading skulls and faces like you read a book. Heres a face. Ill put it in front of you. Read it if you can.\nTashtego says that he died and was reborn. His extra days are a gift. He wasnt saved by Christ, though, he says he was saved by a fellow man and a non-Christian at that. He parodies the resurrection.\nWhen Starbuck tells Ahab that he should let bygones be bygones, the angry captain snaps back, Speak not to me of blasphemy, man, Id strike the sun if it insulted me. Ahab, too, is a poet of eloquence. He says, The path to my fixed purpose is laid with iron rails whereon my soul is grooved to run. Or these lines, All visible objects are but pasteboard masks. Quotable poetic phrases that cant be beat.\nFinally, Ahab spots Moby, and the harpoons come out. Boats are lowered. Ahabs harpoon has been baptized in blood. Moby attacks Ahabs boat and destroys it. Next day, he sights Moby again. Boats are lowered again. Moby attacks Ahabs boat again. On the third day, another boat goes in. More religious allegory. He has risen. Moby attacks one more time, ramming the Pequod and sinking it. Ahab gets tangled up in the harpoon lines and is thrown out of his boat into a watery grave.\nIshmael survives. Hes in the sea floating on a coffin. And thats about it. Thats the whole story. That theme and all that it implies would work its way into more than a few of my songs.\nAll Quiet on the Western Front was another book that did. All Quiet on the Western Front is a horror story. This is a book where you lose your childhood, your faith in a meaningful world, and your concern for individuals. Youre stuck in a nightmare. Sucked up into a mysterious whirlpool of death and pain. Youre defending yourself from elimination. Youre being wiped off the face of the map. Once upon a time you were an innocent youth with big dreams about being a concert pianist. Once you loved life and the world, and now youre shooting it to pieces.\nDay after day, the hornets bite you and worms lap your blood. Youre a cornered animal. You dont fit anywhere. The falling rain is monotonous. Theres endless assaults, poison gas, nerve gas, morphine, burning streams of gasoline, scavenging and scabbing for food, influenza, typhus, dysentery. Life is breaking down all around you, and the shells are whistling. This is the lower region of hell. Mud, barbed wire, rat-filled trenches, rats eating the intestines of dead men, trenches filled with filth and excrement. Someone shouts, Hey, you there. Stand and fight.\nWho knows how long this mess will go on? Warfare has no limits. Youre being annihilated, and that leg of yours is bleeding too much. You killed a man yesterday, and you spoke to his corpse. You told him after this is over, youll spend the rest of your life looking after his family. Whos profiting here? The leaders and the generals gain fame, and many others profit financially. But youre doing the dirty work. One of your comrades says, Wait a minute, where are you going? And you say, Leave me alone, Ill be back in a minute. Then you walk out into the woods of death hunting for a piece of sausage. You cant see how anybody in civilian life has any kind of purpose at all. All their worries, all their desires – you cant comprehend it.\nMore machine guns rattle, more parts of bodies hanging from wires, more pieces of arms and legs and skulls where butterflies perch on teeth, more hideous wounds, pus coming out of every pore, lung wounds, wounds too big for the body, gas-blowing cadavers, and dead bodies making retching noises. Death is everywhere. Nothing else is possible. Someone will kill you and use your dead body for target practice. Boots, too. Theyre your prized possession. But soon theyll be on somebody elses feet.\nTheres Froggies coming through the trees. Merciless bastards. Your shells are running out. Its not fair to come at us again so soon, you say. One of your companions is laying in the dirt, and you want to take him to the field hospital. Someone else says, You might save yourself a trip. What do you mean? Turn him over, youll see what I mean.\nYou wait to hear the news. You dont understand why the war isnt over. The army is so strapped for replacement troops that theyre drafting young boys who are of little military use, but theyre draftin ‘em anyway because theyre running out of men. Sickness and humiliation have broken your heart. You were betrayed by your parents, your schoolmasters, your ministers, and even your own government.\nThe general with the slowly smoked cigar betrayed you too – turned you into a thug and a murderer. If you could, youd put a bullet in his face. The commander as well. You fantasize that if you had the money, youd put up a reward for any man who would take his life by any means necessary. And if he should lose his life by doing that, then let the money go to his heirs. The colonel, too, with his caviar and his coffee – hes another one. Spends all his time in the officers brothel. Youd like to see him stoned dead too. More Tommies and Johnnies with their whack fo me daddy-o and their whiskey in the jars. You kill twenty of ‘em and twenty more will spring up in their place. It just stinks in your nostrils.\nYouve come to despise that older generation that sent you out into this madness, into this torture chamber. All around you, your comrades are dying. Dying from abdominal wounds, double amputations, shattered hipbones, and you think, Im only twenty years old, but Im capable of killing anybody. Even my father if he came at me.\nYesterday, you tried to save a wounded messenger dog, and somebody shouted, Dont be a fool. One Froggy is laying gurgling at your feet. You stuck him with a dagger in his stomach, but the man still lives. You know you should finish the job, but you cant. Youre on the real iron cross, and a Roman soldiers putting a sponge of vinegar to your lips.\nMonths pass by. You go home on leave. You cant communicate with your father. He said, Youd be a coward if you dont enlist. Your mother, too, on your way back out the door, she says, You be careful of those French girls now. More madness. You fight for a week or a month, and you gain ten yards. And then the next month it gets taken back.\nAll that culture from a thousand years ago, that philosophy, that wisdom – Plato, Aristotle, Socrates – what happened to it? It should have prevented this. Your thoughts turn homeward. And once again youre a schoolboy walking through the tall poplar trees. Its a pleasant memory. More bombs dropping on you from blimps. You got to get it together now. You cant even look at anybody for fear of some miscalculable thing that might happen. The common grave. There are no other possibilities.\nThen you notice the cherry blossoms, and you see that nature is unaffected by all this. Poplar trees, the red butterflies, the fragile beauty of flowers, the sun – you see how nature is indifferent to it all. All the violence and suffering of all mankind. Nature doesnt even notice it.\nYoure so alone. Then a piece of shrapnel hits the side of your head and youre dead.\nYouve been ruled out, crossed out. Youve been exterminated. I put this book down and closed it up. I never wanted to read another war novel again, and I never did.\nCharlie Poole from North Carolina had a song that connected to all this. Its called You Aint Talkin to Me, and the lyrics go like this:\nI saw a sign in a window walking up town one day.\nJoin the army, see the world is what it had to say.\nYoull see exciting places with a jolly crew,\nYoull meet interesting people, and learn to kill them too.\nOh you aint talkin to me, you aint talking to me.\nI may be crazy and all that, but I got good sense you see.\nYou aint talkin to me, you aint talkin to me.\nKillin with a gun dont sound like fun.\nYou aint talkin to me.\nThe Odyssey is a great book whose themes have worked its way into the ballads of a lot of songwriters: Homeward Bound, Green, Green Grass of Home, Home on the Range, and my songs as well.\nThe Odyssey is a strange, adventurous tale of a grown man trying to get home after fighting in a war. Hes on that long journey home, and its filled with traps and pitfalls. Hes cursed to wander. Hes always getting carried out to sea, always having close calls. Huge chunks of boulders rock his boat. He angers people he shouldnt. Theres troublemakers in his crew. Treachery. His men are turned into pigs and then are turned back into younger, more handsome men. Hes always trying to rescue somebody. Hes a travelin man, but hes making a lot of stops.\nHes stranded on a desert island. He finds deserted caves, and he hides in them. He meets giants that say, Ill eat you last. And he escapes from giants. Hes trying to get back home, but hes tossed and turned by the winds. Restless winds, chilly winds, unfriendly winds. He travels far, and then he gets blown back.\nHes always being warned of things to come. Touching things hes told not to. Theres two roads to take, and theyre both bad. Both hazardous. On one you could drown and on the other you could starve. He goes into the narrow straits with foaming whirlpools that swallow him. Meets six-headed monsters with sharp fangs. Thunderbolts strike at him. Overhanging branches that he makes a leap to reach for to save himself from a raging river. Goddesses and gods protect him, but some others want to kill him. He changes identities. Hes exhausted. He falls asleep, and hes woken up by the sound of laughter. He tells his story to strangers. Hes been gone twenty years. He was carried off somewhere and left there. Drugs have been dropped into his wine. Its been a hard road to travel.\nIn a lot of ways, some of these same things have happened to you. You too have had drugs dropped into your wine. You too have shared a bed with the wrong woman. You too have been spellbound by magical voices, sweet voices with strange melodies. You too have come so far and have been so far blown back. And youve had close calls as well. You have angered people you should not have. And you too have rambled this country all around. And youve also felt that ill wind, the one that blows you no good. And thats still not all of it.\nWhen he gets back home, things arent any better. Scoundrels have moved in and are taking advantage of his wifes hospitality. And theres too many of ‘em. And though hes greater than them all and the best at everything – best carpenter, best hunter, best expert on animals, best seaman – his courage wont save him, but his trickery will.\nAll these stragglers will have to pay for desecrating his palace. Hell disguise himself as a filthy beggar, and a lowly servant kicks him down the steps with arrogance and stupidity. The servants arrogance revolts him, but he controls his anger. Hes one against a hundred, but theyll all fall, even the strongest. He was nobody. And when its all said and done, when hes home at last, he sits with his wife, and he tells her the stories.\n\nSo what does it all mean? Myself and a lot of other songwriters have been influenced by these very same themes. And they can mean a lot of different things. If a song moves you, thats all thats important. I dont have to know what a song means. Ive written all kinds of things into my songs. And Im not going to worry about it – what it all means. When Melville put all his old testament, biblical references, scientific theories, Protestant doctrines, and all that knowledge of the sea and sailing ships and whales into one story, I dont think he would have worried about it either – what it all means.\nJohn Donne as well, the poet-priest who lived in the time of Shakespeare, wrote these words, The Sestos and Abydos of her breasts. Not of two lovers, but two loves, the nests. I dont know what it means, either. But it sounds good. And you want your songs to sound good.\nWhen Odysseus in The Odyssey visits the famed warrior Achilles in the underworld – Achilles, who traded a long life full of peace and contentment for a short one full of honor and glory – tells Odysseus it was all a mistake. I just died, thats all. There was no honor. No immortality. And that if he could, he would choose to go back and be a lowly slave to a tenant farmer on Earth rather than be what he is – a king in the land of the dead – that whatever his struggles of life were, they were preferable to being here in this dead place.\nThats what songs are too. Our songs are alive in the land of the living. But songs are unlike literature. Theyre meant to be sung, not read. The words in Shakespeares plays were meant to be acted on the stage. Just as lyrics in songs are meant to be sung, not read on a page. And I hope some of you get the chance to listen to these lyrics the way they were intended to be heard: in concert or on record or however people are listening to songs these days. I return once again to Homer, who says, Sing in me, oh Muse, and through me tell the story.", "Come, you masters of war\nYou that build all the guns\nYou that build the death planes\nYou that build the big bombs\nYou that hide behind walls\nYou that hide behind desks\nI just want you to know\nI can see through your masks\nYou that never done nothin\nBut build to destroy\nYou play with my

be won\nYou want me to believe\nBut I see through your eyes\nAnd I see through your brain\nLike I see through the water\nThat runs down my drain\nYou fasten all the triggers\nFor the others to fire\nThen you set back and watch\nWhen the death count gets higher\nYou hide in your mansion\nAs young peoples blood\nFlows out of their bodies\nAnd is buried in the mud\nYouve thrown the worst fear\nThat can ever be hurled\nThe fear to bring children\nInto the world\nFor threatening my baby\nUnborn and unnamed\nYou aint worth the blood\nThat runs in your veins\nHow much do I know\nTo talk out of turn?\nYou might say that Im young\nYou might say Im unlearned\nBut theres one thing I know\nThough Im younger than you\nEven Jesus would never\nForgive what you do\nLet me ask you one question\nIs your money that good?\nWill it buy you forgiveness?\nDo you think that it could?\nI think you will find\nWhen your death takes its toll\nAll the money you made\nWill never buy back your soul\nAnd I hope that you die\nAnd your death will come soon\nI will follow your casket\nIn the pale afternoon\nAnd Ill watch while youre lowered\nDown to your deathbed\nAnd Ill stand over your grave\nTil Im sure that youre dead", "Paroles de la chanson Backwater Blues :\nIt rained five days\nThe sky has turned black as night\nOh, it rained five days\nAnd the sky has turned black as

hangman’s knot must fall\nI will die upon the gallows pole\nWhen the moon is shining clear\nAnd these are my final words\nThat you will ever hear\nI left my home in Kansas\nWhen I was very young\nI landed in the old Northwest\nSeattle, Washington\nAlthough I’d a-traveled many miles\nI never made a friend\nFor I could never get along in life\nWith people that I met\nIf I had some education\nTo give me a decent start\nI might have been a doctor or\nA master in the arts\nBut I used my hands for stealing\nWhen I was very young\nAnd they locked me down in jailhouse cells\nThat’s how my life begun\nOh, the inmates and the prisoners\nI found they were my kind\nIt was there inside the bars\nI found my peace of mind\nBut the jails they were too crowded\nInstitutions overflowed\nSo they turned me loose to walk upon\nLife’s hurried tangled road\nAnd there’s danger on the ocean\nWhere the salt sea waves split high\nAnd there’s danger on the battlefield\nWhere the shells of bullets fly\nAnd there’s danger in this open world\nWhere men fight to be free\nAnd for me the greatest danger\nWas in society\nSo I asked them to send me back\nTo the institution home\nBut they said they were too crowded\nFor me they had no room\nI got down on my knees and begged\n“Oh, please put me away”\nBut they would not listen to my plea\nOr nothing I would say\nAnd so it was on Christmas Eve\nIn the year of ’59\nIt was on that night I killed a man\nI did not try to hide\nThe jury found me guilty\nAnd I won’t disagree\nFor I knew that it would happen\nIf I wasn’t put away\nBut I’m glad I’ve had no parents\nTo care for me or cry\nFor now they will never know\nThe horrible death that I die\nAnd I’m also glad I’ve had no friends\nTo see me in disgrace\nFor they’ll never see that hangman’s hood\nWrap around my face\nFarewell unto the old north woods\nOf which I used to roam\nFarewell unto the crowded bars\nOf which’ve been my home\nFarewell to all you people\nWho think the worst of me\nI guess you’ll feel much better when\nI’m on that hanging tree\nBut there’s just one question\nBefore they kill me dead\nI’m wondering just how much\nTo you I really said\nConcerning all the boys

probably have heard of\nWere tryna get him out of jail\nPistol shots ring out on a barroom night\nEnter Patty Valentine from the outer hall\nShe sees a bartender in a pool of blood\nCries out, My God, theyve killed them all\nHere comes the story of the Hurricane\nThe man the authorities came to blame\nFor something that he never done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time, he couldve been\nThe champion of the world\nThree bodies lying there does Patty see\nAnd another man named Bello moving mysteriously\nI didnt do it, he says, and he throws up his hands\nI was only robbing the register, you understand?\nI saw them leaving, he says, and he stops\nOne of us had better call on the cops\nAnd so Patty calls the cops\nAnd they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing\nIn the hot New Jersey night\nMeanwhile, far away, in another part of town\nRubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around\nNumber one contender for the middleweight crown\nHad no idea what kinda shit was about to go down\nWhen a cop pulled him over to the side of the road\nJust like the time before and the time before that\nIn Paterson, thats the way things go\nIf youre black, you might as well not show up on the street\nLess you want to draw the heat\nAlfred Bello, he had this rap on the cops\nHe and Arthur Dexter Bradley were in here prowling around\nHe saw two men running out of here, they looked like middleweights\nJumped into a white car with out-of-state plates\nAnd Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head\nCop said, Wait a minute, boys, this ones not dead\nSo they took him to the infirmary\nAnd though this man could hardly see\nThey told him he could identify the guilty men\nFour in the morning and they haul Rubin in\nTake him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs\nThe wounded man looks up through his one dying eye\nSays, Whyd you bring him in here for? He aint the guy\nYes, heres the story of the Hurricane\nThe man the authorities came to blame\nFor something that he never done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time he couldve been\nThe champion of the world\nFour months later, the ghettos are in flame\nRubins in South America fighting for his name\nArthur Dexter Bradleys still in the robbery game\nAnd the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for someone to blame\nRemember that murder that happened in a bar?\nRemember you said you saw the getaway car?\nYou think youd like to play ball with the law?\nThink it mightve been that fighter that you saw running that night?\nDont forget now, youre white\nArthur Dexter Bradley said, Im really not sure\nCops said, A poor boy like you could use a break\nWe got you for the motel job, were talking to your friend Bello\nYou dont want to have to go back to jail, be a nice fellow\nYoull be doing society a favor\nThat son of a bitch is brave and getting braver\nWe want to put his ass in stir\nWe want to pin this triple murder on him\nHe aint no Gentleman Jim\nRubin could take a man out with just one punch\nNever did like to talk about it all that much\nIts my work, hed say, I do it for pay\nAnd when its over, Id just as soon go on my way\nUp to some paradise\nWhere the trout streams flow and the air is nice\nAnd ride a horse along a trail\nBut then they took him to the jailhouse\nWhere they try to turn a man into a mouse\nAll of Rubins cards were marked in advance\nThe trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance\nThe judge made Rubins witnesses drunkards from the slums\nTo the white folks who watched, he was a revolutionary bum\nAnd to the black folks, he was just a crazy nigger\nNo one doubted that he pulled the trigger\nAnd though they could not produce the gun\nThe D.A. said he was the one who did the deed\nAnd the all-white jury agreed\nRubin Carter was falsely tried\nThe crime was murder one, guess who testified?\nBello and Bradley, and they both lied\nAnd the newspapers, they all went along for the ride\nHow can the life of such a man\nBe in the palm of some fools hand?\nTo see him obviously framed\nCouldnt help but make me feel ashamed\nTo live in a land where justice is a game\nNow all the criminals in their coats and their ties\nAre free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise\nWhile Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell\nAn innocent man in a living hell\nThats the story of the Hurricane\nBut it wont be over til they clear his name\nAnd give him back the time hes done\nPut in a prison cell, but one time\nHe couldve been the champion of the world", "Im walking through the summer nights\nThe jukebox playing low\nYesterday everything was going too fast\nToday its moving too slow\nI got no place left to turn\nI got

trail\nFor the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale\nAn for each unharmfull, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail\nAn we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing\nStarry-eyed an laughing as I recall when we were caught\nTrapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended\nAs we listened one last time an we watched with one last look\nSpellbound an swallowed til the tolling ended\nTolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed\nFor the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an worse\nAn for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe\nAn we gazed

We were in a hockey arena in Chicago. There were maybe 18,000 people there. The Band and I hadn’t played publicly together since 1966 where our shows caused a lot of disruption and turmoil—a lot of anger. Now we were in Chicago starting up again. There was no way to predict what was going to happen. At the end of the concert we had played over 25 or 30 songs and we were standing on the stage looking out. The audience was in semi-darkness. All of a sudden, somebody lit a match. And then somebody else lit another match. In short time, there were areas of the arena that were engulfed in matches. Within seconds after that, it looked like the whole arena was in flames and that all the people in the arena had struck matches and were going to burn the place down. The Band and I looked for the nearest stage exit as none of us wanted to go down in flames. It seemed like nothing had changed. If we thought the response was extreme on the earlier tours we played, this was positively apocalyptic. Every one of us on the stage thought that we’d really done it this time—that the fans were going to burn the arena down. Obviously we were wrong. We misinterpreted and misunderstood the reaction of the crowd. What we believed to be disapproval was actually a grand appreciative gesture. Appearances can be deceiving.\nFor this series of paintings, the idea was to create pictures that would not be misinterpreted or misunderstood by me or anybody else. When the Halcyon Gallery brought the idea of me doing American landscapes for an exhibition, all they had to do was say it once. And after a bit of clarification, I took it to heart and ran with it. The common theme of these works having something to do with the American landscape—how you see it while crisscrossing the land and seeing it for what it’s worth. Staying out of the mainstream and traveling the back roads, free-born style. I believe that the key to the future is in the remnants of the past. That you have to master the idioms of your own time before you can have any identity in the present tense. Your past begins the day you were born and to disregard it is cheating yourself of who you really are.\nMy idea was to keep things simple, only deal with what is externally visible. These paintings are up to the moment realism—archaic, most static, but quivering in appearance. They contradict the modern world. However, that’s my doing. The San Francisco Chinatown street stands merely two blocks away from corporate, windowless buildings. But these cold giant structures have no meaning for me in the world that I see or choose to see or be a part of or gain entrance to. If you look half a block away from the Coney Island hot-dog stand, the sky is littered with high rises. I choose not to see them either. Down the road, across the highway from the Cabin in the Woods is a manicured golf course. But it has little meaning compared to the seemingly worthless shack which speaks to me. The Alabama Side Show is surrounded by woods in all directions. The side show happens to be in a clearing and you go there by dirt road. I chose to paint the side show instead of the endless woods. There are countless other works where this is also true.\nAll the iconography is used in a semi-conscious way. I chose images because of the meanings they have for me, and patterns can be seen in the repeating images—roads, shacks, piers, automobiles, streets, bayous, railroad tracks, bridges, motels, truck stops, power lines, farmyards, theater marquees, churches, signs and symbols, etc.—all establishing a certain type of compositional value. I would say the purpose is plain, non-experimental or exploratory.\nSome of these works have much complexity of detail. Some are less demanding . . . in some cases my hand couldn’t do what my eye was perceiving. So I went to the camera-obscura method. The camera obscura was a primitive camera invented in the 1600s which projected an image upside down so the painter could work from it. This was a real camera, but the image was not printable. It could only be seen and filled in. Caravaggio used this in about all of his paintings and so did Van Eyck and Vermeer. These days you don’t have to go to all that trouble. You can use a real camera. I put a 58-mm 0.43x wide-angle conversion lens onto a used Nikon D3300 Af-p on quite a few paintings, Downtown Bank, Katz’s, Nathans, Russ & Daughters, Roy’s, Blue Line, among others, and was able to get the desired effect. If that didn’t work, I used a convex Plexiglass RCA 24 x 20 television screen that can be found in old junk shops and looked at the world through that. On Curry Road in Arizona, I used an old movie frame, and I did that on a couple of different paintings, too. In just as many others I drew it straight on. Topanga Ranch, Ice Cream Factory, Truck Stops, Flat Top Mt. Diner, and Del Rio Cantina. The method with the particular altered lens was used for fullness of effect. In a lot of the other cases, all I needed was a straight edge, compass, and a T square going on a case-by-case basis without abandoning tradition or adhering to any conventions or aesthetic doctrines.\nThe watercolors and acrylics done here purposely show little or no emotion, yet I would say they are not necessarily emotionally stringent. The attempt was made to represent reality and images as they are without idealizing them. My idea is to compose works that create stability, working with generalized, universal, and easily identifiable objects. Throughout, there is the attempt to depict scenes of life and inanimate life for their own sake . Da Vinci paints a blurred picture—you see no lines but clouds that fade into one another with different color schemes. An opposing view would be Mondrian and Van Gogh with strict lines that define the volumes of space. In the middle somewhere would be Kandinsky and Rouault. And these paintings would probably fall into that category.\nAn attempt was made to depersonalize the works—strip them of illusion. All the work is exclusively placed in non-exotic settings within a rationally defined space. The focus points are important and sometimes unusually placed. Background and foreground not easily defined. In Amusement Park Alleyway, the focus point is the Ferris wheel in the background. The orange Chevy truck might be centered in the foreground but it’s not the focal point. In Morning in Pittsburgh, the focal point would be the bridge in the background instead of the larger warehouse in the foreground. Just like in the Flat Top Diner, the focal point might actually be the green trees.\nI tried to create the two dimensional image using a mathematical system. At times, the background and foreground converge. Natural scenery is always the main feature. These are not crowded compositions. They are using basic structures to express feelings and ideas. Perfect proportion and logic instead of emotion. The nature of beauty, the lines, forms, shape, and texture that emphasize the recognizable create harmony where natural scenery is the main feature.\nI restricted myself to traditional subject matter, viewing nothing as shallow or gaudy. A simple hot-dog stand can have classical features, and I view it as such . Whiplash curves, flying buttresses, pointed steeples, arches, and waves. They are all there, reflecting any time period, purposely trying to stay away from dramatic or theatrical lighting effects, bringing naturalism to the forefront.\nIn some paintings, the brightness of reflected light was brought forth in evident brushstrokes. Sometimes sunlight hitting certain places would contrast deeply with areas of shadow . I tried to avoid skewed perspectives or man-made light, yet sometimes it couldn’t be avoided. An expert painter is a master in color theory, which means he can turn white into black using a complex value system of colors and hues like a Mark Rothko. “The Beaten Path” however, reflects explorations in color, sometimes using colors that become less pronounced and outlines that become less precise. Other times tipping toward the monochromatic .\nFlowing or curved lines form another visual vehicle, suggesting a far distance in a landscape painting. Architecture itself is always a vital source of ideas and inspiration, but, always, “The Beaten Path” tries to return to the traditional methods of perceptions—things that are perceived in the visible world—taking the three dimensional into a two dimensional format using contrast, location, isolation, and convergence.\nIf there is a soundtrack to this compilation of paintings, I would say it could be recordings by Peetie Wheatstraw in some places, Charlie Parker in others, Clifford Brown or Blind Lemon, maybe Guitar Slim—artists that make us a lot bigger when listening to them. It would have to be that way. Absolutely.\nThere was a conscious attempt to dismiss consumer culture or popular culture, including mass media, commercial art, celebrities, consumer or product packaging, billboard signs, comic strips, magazine advertising. “The Beaten Path” works represent a different subject matter from the everyday imagery of consumer culture. There is nothing to suggest these paintings were inspired by the writings of Sigmund Freud or that they were based on any mental images that occur in dreams, no fantasy worlds, religious mysticism or ambiguous subject matter. In every picture the viewer doesn’t have to wonder whether it’s an actual object or a delusional one. If the viewer visited where the picture actually existed, he or she would see the same thing. It is what unites us all.", "Ma, take this badge off of me\nI cant use it any more\nIt is getting dark, too dark to see\nFeel like I am knocking on heaven’s door\nKnock, knock, knocking on heavens
