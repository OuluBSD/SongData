and his motherfucking shadow\nYall gon see him under dirt or some motherfucking gravel\nHe wont be able to walk, move, or motherfucking travel\nAnd Im a show up to your funeral in that same fucking hoodie I wear every fucking battle!\nYou make the worst life decisions, for instance\nWhy the fuck do you throw up every time you in front of a good crowd?\nWhy do all of your close battles turn into 8 Mile?\nYour palms be sweaty, knees weeks, arms be heavy\nVomit on that sweater already, Charlies spaghetti\nHes nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready\nTo drop bombs but it get Osama deadly\nSo when you say you a killa, I believe it cause you show the world\nThat you are a hit man, another nigga calling Earl\nYou make the worst life... nah fuck all that\nReading them tweets and them blogs became extremely upsetting\nYall saying with DNAs intellect and K-Shine aggression It can go ether direction?\nNow either that was an insult to my intelligence\nOr yalldont know the difference between a beast and a peasant\nBut being that we using DNA its only right I take a scientific method and teach yall a lesson\nGive me a second...\nNow yall probably wondering why l bring all this to the center stage\nCause if yall dont understand a human body\nAll you gotta do is breakdown DNA\nYou aint got a tough joint connected to your fucking bones\nYou lost to X that s why I see bitch when the chrome is on \nA sperm cell from Charlie, but if hes the heart\nThat mean that blood that pump through your veins\nAint thick enough to hold its own\nSo every time you spit they bring organs center stage\nIf yall wanna understand a human body\nAll you gotta do is breakdown DNA\nWait, now lets go these bars so yall could feel this\nIf yall aint familiar with this, this a double helix\nIts the same setup that this nigga use with his lyrics\nBut Im a show you how to take this DNA with this DNA and compare it\nYou use one solid bar and try to make it a setup\nThan use words that coincide to make it look better\nThan and it with a wavy line so yall think that he clever\nBut I dont know how he fucking yall head up\nWhen Ds just like the setup A double helix\nTwo wavy lines with little bars in between that keep em together\nIf yall wanna know why I brung all this to the center stage\nIf yall dont understand a human body All you gotta do H breakdown DNA\nNow everyones familiar with a cell is right?\nWe all know the human body was processed from this cell, sperm cell\nWhich gave us life, right?\nWhich is also DNA, but I dont think thats bright\nCause ironically DNA has never been in a cell in his life\nHave you ever seen a cell? Have you ever made a sale?\nHave you ever been in a cell? No\nThats what lead us back to this chart\nCause these are blood cells they travel through your veins\nTo give that little shit in your chest a spark\nIf you lack these that mean you never had a beat from the start\nSo a cell is not an option all your beats are for bars\nCause DNA can never live in a cell if you aint got no heart nigga\nIf yall wanna know why I brung all this to the center stage\nIf yall dont understand a human body\nAll you gotta do is breakdown DNA\nNow an Atom is the reason why a human energy is possible Two more atoms together creates a molecule\nAll your energy comes from a nigga holding you down\nSo your energys on top of you\nLets see where all your energy goes when them real clips is inside of you\nSo if yall wanna know why I brought all this to the center stage If yall dont understand a human body\nAll you gotta do is breakdown DNA\nNo before I leave this segment Im a leave a grade on how a human gets body \nIts only right we give D and A\nNow yall see why l grabbed this shit? Alright now class dismissed\nNow look, what Fab say?\nI wipe all my tears before I put on my gloves\nCause it hurt when you gotta kill a nigga you love?\nWell I want you to know how I feel since Im in that position\nI feel like Nino Brown, nigga, minus all of the snitching\nG money, we couldve been getting lump sums of bread\nYou let one of yo bitches that Im dicking fuck with yo head\nNow instead of getting work, you getting worked\nGetting fucked up instead\nYou mean to tell me that measley bitch creeping is the reason our whole operation dead?\nInstead of expressing your feelings you give your dawgs up to the Feds?\nThats why when you say Am I my brothers keeper?\nI look you square in your eyes nigga and say YES I AM!\nAnd give you one to the head\nAnd Clips you condone this shit?\nWe was supposed to be like brothers\nWe made this carter look good\nWe was holding down each other\nYou let another nigga infiltrate\nHe end up being undercover\nNow everybody going down, this shit bigger than Nino Brown\nAnd Conceited, I never liked you anyway, pretty motherfucker\nThat chopper like a psychic, it be getting my palms read\nYou caught that?\nThat chopper like a psychic, it be getting my palms red\nI send that nigga right to the light if Con Ed\nI got a long clip that be hanging like \nItll be like Eric said a line , Conceited didnt get the bar said\nI have DNA going right over Con head\nZIP EM UP!!!!\nNow in that last round you tried to breakdown my body\nAnd I admit you let your heater spray too\nBut how can you compare a whole round to something\nWhen you about human too and you got DNA too\nSo I cant even dap him up or give him props or respect him Cause how we know you got body parts\nBut I wont speak about cause niggas already touched your rectum\nNow round 1 I told yall the definition of Shine\nWas a quality of brightness that reflects light\nThis round Im a indicate every way possible\nWhy him choosing that name just aint bright\nFor instance, when you battled John John You spit a whole round about him biting people\nLike you aint have a fight outside with Joe Light and was biting people\nHe said You wanna battle me Shine? you said No\nHe said Who you getting loud with Shine? You said Yo After that you aint look like Iron Mike\nYou showed your true colors when it was time to fight\nCause even though you got ultra violent \nWe all saw the outcome between Shine and Light\nNow how the fuck is Shine bright when this stupid nigga got rhymes like\nYou told Passwurdz that 2Pac was only known for being well paid\nBut the only thing that he was really known for Was for being born and dying in LA\nFirst off 2Pac died in Vegas, thats your number one problem nigga\nAnd 2: he was born in your borough\nThats howl know you not a Harlem nigga\nSo how the fuck is Shine bright when this stupid nigga got rhymes like\nYou told John John Its bets off if you think that Don King Now that was cool but before that you said a odd thing\nCause you told John John you let your palm spring\nExactly how do you let your palm spring?\nI guess that means you can winter a neck or summer a lead\nI find that odd yall, but since you using seasons\nWhen I shoot make your arm fall\nNow the fuck is Shin... you know what, lets get into some different stuff\nAt Summer Madness 2 we witnessed 2,000 people see another nigga grip your butt\nAfter that you was fuckin with trannies\nOn being straight we started giving up\nAnd on top of that your man slogan is Zip Em Up\nNow either Im buggin or mothafuckas is trippin\nBut now you got me curious to know what the fuck you zipping?\nYou just another 5 foot nigga with a death wish\nSawed off Shotty but shit aint shooting out bread sticks\nI break every bone in your foot you try to give me that easy dead kick\nSo that when you slide up like a dancer well all see your leg twitch\nFirst Dot Mob was lookin shaky, now Zip Em Up lookin desperate\nWhere the fuck you find your soldiers at Shine?\nLook like you got off Craigslist\nI catch yall while yall at a party, load up, let my tec spit\nAnd give a dip to everybody thats on line, nigga Im Netflix\nAnd when I shoot you better hope that them shells miss you\nBut how you a Blood but dont rep it? Let me 2-12 with you\nIn the streets you dont got a ratchet, you dont hold niggas guns\nWhen its beef you dont fight, we never seen you fold niggas once\nIn jail you used to wash niggas socks and owe niggas funds\nSo it makes sense why you Blood, cause out of 32 niggas you owe 31 \nNow Im loading up in Jersey with an old dirty gun\nAnd since Red Blood too I give 0 31\nThan after that I clip his dreads\nBullets ricocheted off his ear than hit his head\nNow yall probably wondering why Im mixing Shine and 0 together\nNot cause them niggas dead Im just showing yall after I kill a Dot I got it in for Red \nAnd if Roc owe me a rock thatll get you killed\nSo you better have my cake doe\nCause once I start shootin all you niggas better lay low\nYou gon see, if I see this cat fishing Im a let my 8 go\nSo just think Notre Dame cause Im a get this man tied if Tay owe\nPlus l feel like Lebron cause Im good with the Heat\nMy credibility perfect everywhere nigga, Im good in these streets Third round Im cookin him nigga\nShine looking deceased\nBut Don Demarco I feel like Freeway, so put on a beat\nRound 3, yeah its getting hot in here\nYall know my slogan\nRound 3, yeah its getting hot in here\nYall know my slogan \nFirst I murder Roc, just got rid of Tay Tay\nKill em in the morning, Im a show you how to break Day\nNo scope, no chopper, you dont even need an AK\nJust a big ass Streetsweeper to get K slayed \nFuck it, now l see Im who you idolize\nDeaths been set and your funerals been finalized\nFam gon get em a wake with this iron 9\nNow your people mourning \nSee your soul rising shine \nSo nigga rise and shine, Im in my best day\nNever could you see me in the swing Im in my best place\nScope 4-5 and the 9 with the best aim\nRIP to BIG cause he dying on his death date\nReady for mine, steady with 9s, heavy with rhymes\nGave him a warning now he ready to die\nGreat with respect, signing them checks\nThat 9 and that Who Shot Ya, now you seeing Life After Death\nAnd Im a Roc A Fella, and hell nah I aint with Roc-A-Fella\nHe gon rock now but Im gon rock forever\nI give this nigga some hot shit like Dr. Pepper\nAnd I just killed him on beat and Acappella", "+ \nUh \nCome on \nIt goes B to the I to the G so proper\nMissy and Big Poppa \nCall us chief knockers\nDamn Ma, I love you like the lah, the ganja\nSensimilla, can I feel ya\nAll I wanna do is touch ya\nThe ultimate rush, youre drugs baby\nDont you know Im the ultimate?

Take control of your shit, dont -- dont be the type of rapper.. Dont be a stupid rapper.\nA stupid rapper is a motherfucker that has somebody else tell them what to do -- which is not always wrong, but -- if its something that you feel that you dont have to do, you really have to question it and find out why they want you to do it. Most niggas, they feel like, well, you see what Biggies doing! Yknow, he has the hat, the Kangol, and, and this, and you have to be like that! But if you dont really wanna be like that, you dont have to be like that, you know what Im saying? A lot of motherfuckers just try to tell a nigga to do something so quick, and -- and give them examples of other motherfuckers who did it and blew up and make them think they can do the same thing, which is not always necessarily true. And at the same time, you got to watch your money. Its so much funny shit in this game, man -- and they can play with your money, and you wont even know. I mean, as soon as I got in the game, I got a lawyer to watch my lawyer. Thats just the way its supposed to be played, you know what Im saying? I speak to niggas -- I speak to niggas that got money in the game and they let me know, you know dog, its a dog eat dog world. Niggas is trying to get as much as they can. And if you a ignorant motherfucker, they gon thrive off that. They can tell you anything. And Im -- I never been stupid, so.. Especially with a whole big lump sum of money? I gotta keep by on that. So I just stay more in the business side of everything -- instead of being a nigga thats gonna be drunk at the bar and fuck all the bitches and.. and just, stay in hotels all day, and just trick a whole lot of money, I stay home with my wife and watch my money.

find happiness in anything\nI started reviewing all the places I was searching\nLike money, jewellery and women\nCars, guns, killing, clubs, drugs, hustling\nLook at the lifestyle we was living\nNow I find satisfaction in the simple things\nLook at the inner peace that religion brings\nLike, just knowing your purpose in life\nLike, knowing the Angel of Death can take your soul tonight\nLike, the possibility of you getting to paradise\nYou know, knowing you can get there if youre living right\nLike, you was on the left then you went right\nLike, Allah found you lost and He chose to guide\nSo
