Griot, pictured here and played by actor Brandon Hirsch, is a one man Greek chorus; A broken ear witness to unspeakable crimes . I am blessed and grateful to have an amazing crew and unbelievably talented cast whose creative currency will super charge every pixel of every single frame. As a team of artists, we are especially excited about hiring local youth from Inglewood and South Central Los Angeles to work on the film, so that they can benefit from the experience of participating in a local professional film production.

Most of it is completely unimaginative but Griots Lament is much different It truly is a short-form theatrical experience on the small screen that evokes thoughts with the kind of intellectual depth, auditory stimulation and cadence, and visual creativity that many of us so desire. It truly captures the wonder, the suspense, the social commentary that can draw you in and leave you sitting - wanting more.

It is excellently done and one of the most innovative web series that I’ve seen in a long time and it comes from director, Aleks Munoz.\nHere is what the Director had to say about his latest effort, “My next film “GRIOT”S LAMENT” applies Michael Jackson’s lyrics to the artists’ ongoing exploration of metamorphosis as a threshold of change, and as medium for identifying political and social injustices .”\nAn innocent black man was killed, and we are that injustice” sang Michael alongside his sister Janet in the song SCREAM.

"Pop music is usually understood to be commercially recorded music, often oriented towards a youth market, usually consisting of relatively short, simple songs utilizing technological innovations to produce new variations on existing themes. Pop music has absorbed influences from most other forms of popular music, but as a genre is particularly associated with the rock and roll and later rock style.The phrase “pop music” was first coined around the middle of the 1920′s, it meant a piece of music had “popular” appeal. Numerous things that took place during the recordings of the 20′s could be seen as being the start of the modern day pop music industry, which includes rhythm and blues music, as well as, country, folk, and others.\nPop music has been a profitable industry in America since the 19th century, but Early Pop/Rock is a style that took shape in the post-rock & roll era, once the more conservative elements of the record industry had come to terms with the new musical landscape. Popular culture is distributed across many forms of mass communication including newspapers, magazines, radio, television, movies, music, books and cheap novels, comics and cartoons, and advertising. It contrasts with high cultural art forms, such as opera, classical music and artworks, traditional theater and literature. In mass communication, the term popular culture refers to messages that make limited intellectual and aesthetic demands through content that is designed to amuse and entertain audiences.\nMichael Joseph Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, in Gary, Indiana, the seventh of Katherine and Joe Jackson’s nine children. At the age of 5, Jackson began performing with his older brothers in a music group coached by their steelworker father. In 1968, Motown Records signed the group, which became known as the Jackson 5, and Michael Jackson, a natural showman, emerged as the lead singer and star. The Jackson 5’s first album, released in 1969, featured the hit I Want You Back, and the group’s brand of pop-soul-RnB music made them an immediate success. Their musical popularity even led to their starring in their own TV cartoon series in the early 1970s. Jackson released his first solo album, Got to Be There, in 1972, while continuing to sing with his brothers. Six years later, in 1978, he made his big-screen debut as the Scarecrow in The Wiz, an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name. Directed by Quincy Jones, the film starred an all-black cast that included singer Diana Ross as Dorothy. Jones collaborated with Jackson on his 1979 album “Off the Wall,” which sold some 7 million copies worldwide. The pair teamed up again for Jackson’s now-iconic 1982 album, Thriller, which went on to sell 50 million copies around the globe, making it the best-selling studio album of all time. Thriller is credited with jump-starting the era of music videos and playing a key role in the rise of then-fledging cable TV network MTV, which launched in 1981. With his record-breaking album Thriller and such international hit singles as “Billie Jean” and “Beat It,” Michael Jackson became the quintessential ’80s pop star. Jackson’s ability to blend r&b with pop, rock guitars with dance beats, combined with his cross-format radio success and innovative videos to create a pop music template that is still with us today.",

universe\nAnd the whole world abounds in magic\nWonder fills our hearts for what we have glimpsed for an instant:\nThe playfulness of life\nAnd that’s why I love children\nAnd learn so much from being around them\nI realize that many of our world’s problems today\nFrom thе inner-city crime to large-scalе wars and terrorism\nAnd our overcrowded prisons\nAre a result of the fact that children have had their childhoods stolen from them\nThe magic, the wonder, the mystery and the innocence of a child’s heart are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world\nI really believe that\nI love you

can, and should, think whatever you want\nIf you want to think the world is flat, go right ahead\nBut, if you think the world is flat, and you have influence over others\nAs would\nSuccessful rappers\nOr even presidential candidates\nThen being wrong becomes being harmful to the health\nThe wealth, and the security of our citizens\nDiscovery and exploration got us out of the caves\nAnd each generation benefits from what previous generations have learned\nIsaac Newton, my man, said\nIf I have seen farther than others, its by standing on the shoulders of giants\nCan I get an
