not even a mouse\nThe stockings were hung by the chimney with care\nIn the hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there\nThe children were nestled all snug in their beds\nWhile visions of sugar plums danced in their heads\nMom in her kerchief and I in my cap\nHad just settled down for a long winters nap\nWhen out on the lawn there arose such a clatter\nI sprang from my bed to see what was the matter\nAway to the window I flew with a flash\nTore open the shutters and threw up the sash\nThe moon on the breast of the new fallen snow\nGave a luster of mid-day to objects below\nWhen what to my wondering eyes should appear\nBut a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer\nWith a little old driver so lively and quick\nWell I knew in a moment, it must be st. nick\nMore rapid than eagles, his coursers they came\nAnd he whistled and he shouted and he called them by name\nOn Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer and Vixen\nOn Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen!\nTo the top of the porch, to the top of the wall\nNow, dash away, dash away, dash away all!\nAs dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly\nWhen they meet to an obstacle mount to the sky\nSo up to the rooftop the coursers they flew\nWith a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too\nAnd then in a twinkling, I heard on the roof\nThe prancing, the pawing of each little hoof\nAs I drew in my head and was turning around\nDown the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound\nHe was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot\nAnd his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot\nA bundle of toys he had flung on his back\nAnd he looked like a peddler just opning his pack\nHis eyes, how they twinkled, his dimples, how merry\nHis cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry\nHis droll little mouth was drawn up in a bow\nAnd the beard on his chin was as white as the snow\nThe stump of a pipe, he held tight in his teeth\nAnd the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath\nHe had a broad face and a little round belly\nThat shook when laughed like a bowl full of jelly \nHe was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf\nAnd I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself\nA wink of his eye and a twist of his head\nSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread\nHe spoke not a word but went straight to his work\nAnd filled all the stockings and turned with a jerk\nAnd laying a finger to the side of his nose\nAnd giving a nod up the chimney he rose\nHe sprang to his sleigh, and to his team gave a whistle\nAnd away they all flew like the down of a thistle\nBut I heard him exclaim as he drove out of sight\nMerry Christmas to all and to all..goodnight\nGoodnight.", "Its a lesson too late for the learnin\nMade of sand, made of sand\nIn the wink of an eye my soul is turnin\nIn your hand, in your hand\nAre you goin away with
