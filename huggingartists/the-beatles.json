The hills are alive...\nASSISTANT\nWith the sound of music.\nThe Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nWho is responsible for this?\nASSISTANT\nRimsky Korsakov?\nThe assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.\nASSISTANT\nGuy Lombardo?\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs\nMy dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue. Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.\nPEPPERLAND INHABITANTS\nWho? Who? Who?\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO\nWho? Who? Who?\nThe mouth of John expels the question WHO?\nA blue big glove crosses the air.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nAh! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts. Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!\nMEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses\nHere, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.\nCHIEF, exuberant\nThe Glove, the Glove, the Glove!\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO\nGlove? Glove?

All you need is love.\nJOHN\nYes.\nAnd expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.\n1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE\nLove, love, love \nTheres nothing you can do that cant be done\nNothing you can sing that cant be sung\nNothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game\nIts easy\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love, love,\nLove is all you need\nNothing you can know that isnt known,\nNothing you can see that isnt shown\nTheres nowhere you can be\nthat isnt where youre meant to be\nIts easy\nAll you need is love, \nAll you need is love, \nAll you need is love, love,\nLove is all you need\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love\nAll you need is love, love\nThe words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.\nJOHN\nGo, Glove, lovely Glove.\nRINGO\nYou took the words right out of my mouth, John.\nGEORGE\nHey, wait, and watch. Its all in the mind, you know.\nLove is all you need\nLove is all you need\nEverything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.\nShe loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah\nThe meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.\nA little bit further they find a blue glass ball.\nGEORGE\nHey, thats a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.\nJOHN\nIn Pepperland all things are possible.\nPAUL\nIts not a goldfish bowl.\nRINGO\nJust a big glass bowl, then.\nPAUL\nYes, blue glass.\nRINGO\nIt must be from Kentucky.\nPaul knocks the bowl.

Peppers...\nRINGO\nLonely...\nGEORGE\nHearts Club...\nGEORGE\nBand.\nJOHN\nThe resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward\nby Einstein…\nPAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron’\nAny old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.\nJOHN\n… could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...\nThe other three try to break the ball.\nPAUL\nJohn!\nJOHN\n… beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...\nGEORGE\nJohn!\nJOHN\nGeorge?\nGEORGE\nHow do we get them out?\nJOHN\nBreak the glass.\nGEORGE\nWe cant.

I wonder if...\nRingo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.\nRINGO\nYeah, it still works.\nGEORGE\nWe take back all we said.\nJOHN\nYoure a genius.\nPAUL\nA sheer genius.\nRINGO\nI know, I know, I know.

Im glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact theres a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the\nskirmish must we hence.\nJOHN 2\nShall we hence?\nPAUL\nLets not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!\nThe Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.\nJOHN\nWere surrounded.\nRINGO, pointing the four-headed dog\nNice dog, though.\nThe Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:\n1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG\nSheepdog... standing in the rain\nBullfrog... doing it again\nSome kind of happiness\nis measured out in miles\nWhat makes you think youre\nsomething special when you smile?\nChildlike... no one understands\nJack knife... in your sweaty hands\nSome kind of innocence\nis measured out in years\nYou dont know what its like\nto listen to your fears\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me\nIf youre lonely you can talk to me\nBig man... walking in the park\nWigwam... frightened of the dark\nSome kind of solitude\nis measured out in you\nYou think you know me\nbut you havent got a clue\nYou can talk to me,\nYou can talk to me\nYou can talk to me...\nif youre lonely you can talk to me\nHey, bulldog \nJohn to the dog:\nWhat do you say? Sing it.\nDo you know any more? Play it!\nTodos\nHey, bulldog.\nThe Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from\nthe branch of a tree.\nRINGO\nJeremy, can it be you?\nJEREMY\nCan it be me? I think youd better\ninquire of the guards,\nfor when I was captured,\nthey took all my cards.\nRINGO\nShh, thats enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole worlds being attacked.\nJEREMY\nWhat do you want me to do?\nDo you recommend fisticuffs\nversus the guard?\nOh, guard! Blue Meanio!\nLeft to the nostril, right uppercut,\nright to the eyebrow, left to the gut.\nJeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo\ncongratulates Jeremy.\nRINGO\nJeremy!\nJEREMY\nCome on, Ringo!\nThe Chief treats to stem the rout.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nGet back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! Youre advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!\nThe Chief is swept along.\nCHIEF BLUE MEANIE\nMy kingdom for a horse! I think Ill tear him up into little pieces.\nJEREMY\nHe does, does he?\nCHIEF\nI think Ill make a blueburger out of him.\nJEREMY\nHa-ha, I dont care what you think.\nCHIEF\nYou dont, eh? Well soon see about that.\nJEREMY\nHe does in truth seem quite annoyed,\nsome reference material\nbefore Im destroyed.\nWhere ground is soft most often grows,\nArise, arise, arouse, a rose.\nA rosy nose?\nCHIEF\nSpeak your last piece!\nJEREMY\nPeace, peace,\nsupplant the doom and the gloom.\nTurn off what is sour,\nturn into a flower and bloom, bloom.\nHa-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,\nbloom, bloom...\nA lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.\nRINGO\nFirst time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.\nJOHN\nYoure right. Hello there, blue people. Wont you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go\nmingle. What do you say?\nCHIEF\nMax?\nMAX\nYour Blue... I mean your Newness!\nCHIEF, takes some flowers\nIts no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go?\nMAX\nArgentina?\nJOHN\nAre you with us? Will you join?\nCHIEF\nShall we?\nMAX\nNo!... Yes, your Newness!\nCHIEF, smiles\nYes, Max...\nJEREMY, close to them\nYes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,\nA true, universal, euphonious thing.\nIn genders embracing\nand chasing of blues,\nthe very best word\nfor the whole world to use. Ha-ha!\nCHIEF\nYes, let us mix, Max. Ive never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of\nHappiness.\n1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT’S ALL TOO MUCH\nIts all too much\nWhen I look into your eyes,\nYour love is there for me\nAnd the more I go inside,\nthe more there is to see\nIts all too much for me to take\nThe love thats shining all around here\nAll the world is birthday cake,\nSo take a piece but not too much\nEverybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of\nemotion.\nNice to have the time\nto take this opportunity\nTime for me to look at you,\nand you to look at me\nIts all too much for me to see\nThe love thats shining all around you\nEverywhere, its what you make\nFor us to take, its all too much\nIts too much\n1:26:55 PAUL, RINGO, GEORGE AND JOHN IN PERSON\nPAUL\nCatchy tune, that.\nRINGO\nI cant seem to get it out of my head.\nGEORGE\nThen shake it.\nRINGO\nThats what weve been doing all night.\nPAUL\nYeah, it was a great party.\nGEORGE\nAnd we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs.

Blue Meanies?\nJOHN\nNewer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.\nTheres only one way to go out.\nGEORGE\nHows

The boys hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them.\n2.\tEXT. TERMINAL\nThey rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates.\n3.\tEXT. TERMINAL PLATFORM\nWe see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys.\nNORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums. NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing.\nAs the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls.\nAt last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings. JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, its not my fault and the number proceeds.\nSHOT of sudden horror on JOHNs face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them.\nAs the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.\nTHE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line ... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out.\n4.\tINTERIOR RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN\nThe boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof.\nThe three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window.\nPAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again.\nThe boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.\nJOHN\nEh ... pardon me for asking but whos that little old man?\nPAUL\nWhat little old man?\nJOHN\nThat little old man.\nPAUL\nOh, that one. Thats me Grandfather.\nGEORGE\nThats not your Grandfather.\nPAUL\nIt is, yknow.\nGEORGE\nBut your Grandfather lives in your house. Ive seen him.\nPAUL\nOh, thats me other Grandfather, but this ones me Grandfather and all.\nJOHN\nHow dyou reckon that one out?\nPAUL\nWell ... everyones entitled to two, arent they, and this is me other one.\nJOHN\nWell we know that but whats he doing here?\nPAUL\nWell, me mother thought the trip ud do him good.\nRINGO\nHows that?\nPAUL\nOh ... hes nursing a broken heart.\nThe lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.\nJOHN\nAah ... the poor old thing.\nHe leans across to GRANDFATHER.\nJOHN\nEh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then?\nThe GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that indicates yes.\nPAUL\nYou see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.\nGEORGE\nA butcher?\nPAUL\nYeah, she was fickle.\nJOHN\nAye and fond of fresh meat and all.\nPAUL\nNo ... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought itud give him a change of scenery, like.\nJOHN\nOh, I see.\nHe inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.\nJOHN\nEh, hes a nice old man, isnt he?\nPAUL\nOh yeah, hes very clean, yknow.\nThey all agree with PAUL.\nJOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him.\nJOHN\nHello, Grandfather!\nGRANDFATHER\nHello.\nJOHN\nHe can talk then?\nPAUL\nCourse he can talk. Hes a human being, like. Isnt he?\nRINGO\nWell ... if hes your Grandfather, who knows?\nThe lads all laugh.\nJOHN\nAnd were looking after him, are we?\nGRANDFATHER\nIll look after meself.\nPAUL\nAye, thats what Im afraid of!\nJOHN\nHes got you worried, then?\nPAUL\nHim, he costs you a fortune in breach-of-promise cases. Hes a villain and a right mixer as well.\nGEORGE\nGerron.\nPAUL\nNo, straight up.\nGRANDFATHER\nThe lads given you the simple truth. Im cursed wid irresistible charm, Im too attractive to be let loose.\nAt this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment.\nSHAKE\nYou got on all right then?\nBOYS\nHi, Shake.\nSHAKE\nWere here. Normll be along in a mo with the tickets.\nHe sees GRANDFATHER.\nSHAKE\nMorning!\nWhos that little old man?\nGEORGE\nIts Pauls grandfather.\nSHAKE\nOh aye, but I thought ...\nJOHN\nNo, thats his other one.\nSHAKE\nThats all right then.\nJOHN\nClean though, isnt he?\nSHAKE\nOh yes, hes clean all right.\nNORM the road manager appears behind SHAKE.\nNORM\nMorning, lads.\nBOYS\nMorning ... Hi, Norm.\nNORM\nWell, thank God youre all got here. Now, listen, Ive had this marvellous idea ... now just for a change, lets all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Lets not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything Im going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because ...\nHe looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.\nNORM\nAre you listening to me, Lennon?\nJOHN\nYoure a swine, isnt he George?\nGEORGE\nYeah ... a swine.\nNORM\nThanks...\nHe sees the GRANDFATHER.\nNORM\nEh ... .\nBOYS IN CHORUS\n... Whos that little old man?\nNORM\nWell, who is he?\nRINGO\nHe belongs to Paul.\nNORM\nAh well, there you go. Look, Im going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?\nPAUL\nWell follow you down.\nGRANDFATHER rises.\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me coffee.\nNORM\nHe can come with Shake and me if you like.\nPAUL\nWell, look after him. I dont want to find youve lost him.\nNORM\nDont be cheeky, Ill bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.\nGRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.\nNORM\nHes very clean, isnt he?\nSHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other.\nJOHNSON\nMake up your minds, will you!\nAt last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.\nJOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled ... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a by your leave he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again.\nThe boys exchange looks as if to say ... Hello, Saucy!!\nPAUL\nDo you mind if we have it opened?\nJOHNSON\nYes, I do.\nJOHN\nYeah, but there are four of us, like, and wed like it open, if its all the same to you, that is.\nJOHNSON\nWell, it isnt. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose Ive some rights.\nRINGO\nAye, well, so have we.\nHe disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word.\nRINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio. A pop number is playing.\nJOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.\nJOHNSON\nAnd well have that thing off as well, thank you.\nRINGO\nBut I ...\nJOHNSON leans over and switches it off.\nJOHNSON\nAn elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you Im perfectly within my rights.\nHe smiles frostily.\nPAUL\nYeah, but we want to hear it and theres more of us than you. Were a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff!\nJOHNSON\nThen I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong.\nJOHN\nGies a kiss!\nPAUL\nShurrup! Look, Mister, weve paid for our seats too, you know.\nJOHNSON\nI travel on this train regularly, twice a week.\nJOHN\nKnock it off, Paul, y cant win with his sort. After all, its his train, isnt it, Mister?\nJOHNSON\nAnd dont you take that tone with me, young man!\nGEORGE\nBut...\nJOHNSON\nI fought the war for your sort.\nRINGO\nBet youre sorry you won!\nJOHNSON\nIll call the guard!\nPAUL\nAye ... but what? They dont take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Lets get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.\nThe boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous Beatle faces.\nPAUL\nEh, Mister ... can we have our ball back!\nThe man jumps to his feet.\n5.\tINTERIOR OF THE CORRIDOR\nThe boys run away like a pack of school boys and disappear round the corner.\n6.\tINTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR\nFrom the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.\nThe boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside.\n7.\tINTERIOR RESTAURANT CAR\nFrom their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKEs discomfort.\nNORM\nYeah, you want to watch it.\nSHAKE\nIts not my fault.\nNORM\nWell, you stick to that story, son.\nSHAKE\nI cant help it, Im just taller than you.\nGRANDFATHER\nThey always say that.\nNORM\nYeah, well I got me eye on you.\nSHAKE\nIm sorry Norm, but I cant help being taller\nthan you.\nNORM\nWell, you dont have to rub me nose in it. Ive a good mind to ...\nJOHN\nIf youre going to have a barney Ill hold your coats.\nNORM\nHe started it.\nSHAKE\nNo, I didnt you did ...\nGEORGE\nWell, what happened?\nSHAKE\nThe old fella wanted these pictures and Norm said he couldnt have em, all I said was aw go on, be big about it.\nPAUL\nAnd?\nNORM\nYour Grandfather pointed out Shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.\nPAUL\nI knew it, he started it, I should have known.\nNORM\nYwhat?\nPAUL\nYou two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat hes got you at it. Hes a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, theres your asp. Divide and Conquer, thats this ones motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.\nThe BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL.\nPAUL\nAye and well have to watch it and all.\nGEORGE\nI suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.\nNORM\nYoure right. Here you are, old devil.\nSHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.\nGRANDFATHER\nWould you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?\nPAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing.\nJOHN\nCome on lets get this coffee.\nGRANDFATHER\nBefore you go, I think its only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... dont let our Paul have his own way all the time, cos if you do he wont respect you!\nJOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAULs arms.\nGEORGE\nOh, Paul, you cant have your own way!!!\nJOHN\nIf I let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?\nPAUL\nIll murder you, Grandfather!\nJOHN waltzes PAUL down to an empty table and the lads sit down.\nGEORGE\nEh, look at that talent.\nThey all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.\nJOHN\nGive em a pull.\nPAUL\nShall I?\nGEORGE\nAye, but dont rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.\nPAUL\nNow whats that supposed to mean?\nGEORGE\nI dont really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didnt it?\nJOHN\nGeorge Harrison, The Scouse of Distinction.\nWe follow PAUL as he crosses over to the two girls. He places a bowler on his head.\nPAUL\nExcuse me, but these young men Im sitting with wondered if two of us could join you; Id ask you meself only Im shy.\nThe two girls giggle together.\nJOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides.\nGRANDFATHER\nIm sorry, miss, but you mustnt fraternise with my prisoners.\nJEAN\nPrisoners!!\nGRANDFATHER\nConvicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of em.\nTHE BOYS\nYwhat!!!\nGRANDFATHER\nQuiet, you lot, or Ill give you a touch of me truncheon.\nThat little ones the worst. If we dont keep him on tablets he has fits.\nRINGO\nNow look here!!\nGRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGOS mouth.\nGRANDFATHER\nGet out while you can, ladies, his times\ncoming round for one of his turns.\nThe frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted. GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.\n8.\tINTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\nSHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book.\nNORM looks at his watch, slightly worried.\nNORM\nHes been gone a long time.\nSHAKE\nWho?\nNORM\nPauls grandfather.\nSHAKE\nOh, I didnt notice, whered he go?\nNORM\nDown the ... er ...\nSHAKE\nOh, down the ... er ...?\nNORM\nYeah, down the ... er ...\nSHAKE\nWell, give a couple of minutes ...\nHe resumes reading. But NORM goes on worrying.\n9.\tINTERIOR OF ANOTHER RAILWAY COMPARTMENT\nGrandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, Im their manager, I discovered them.\nLADY AUDREY\nDid you indeed, Mr. McCartney?\nGRANDFATHER\nNow, Audrey, I told you, the names John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.\nAUDREY\nOf course, John.\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddys son of em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. Mister, can you spare us a copper? he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.\nAUDREY\nThe usual ten per cent?\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure arent there four of them?\nAUDREY\nHow fascinating. Do go on ...\n... John.\nGRANDFATHER\n... Oh, Im all heart, Maam, all heart ... Well, I let ...\n10.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\nNORM and SHAKE meet with the BOYS as they are returning from coffee.\nNORM\nEh, have you got Pauls grandfather?\nJOHN\nOf course, hes concealed about me person.\nNORM\nNo ... hes must have slipped off somewhere.\nPAUL\nHave you lost him?\nNORM\nDont exaggerate.\nPAUL\nYouve lost him.\nSHAKE\nPut it this way, hes mislaid him.\nPAUL\nYou cant trust you with anything, Norm, if youve lost him, Ill cripple you.\nSHAKE\nHe cant be far.\nJOHN\nI hope he fell off.\nPAUL\nDont be callous.\nRINGO\nHe doesnt like me, honest, I can tell ... Its cos Im little.\nGEORGE\nYouve got an inferiority complex, you have.\nRINGO\nYeah, I know, thats why I took up the drums. Its me active compensatory factor.\nJOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys.\n11.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN\nPAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGOS P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.\nShe is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO.\nRINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her.\nHe looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative. RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: Who, me?\nTANIA smiles enthusiastically.\nGEORGE has been watching all this.\nGEORGE\nAre you going in?\nRINGO\nNo, shell only reject me in the end and Ill be frustrated.\nGEORGE\nYou never know, you might be lucky this time.\nRINGO\nNo, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.\nHe blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.\n12.\tINTERIOR FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR\nPAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.\nPAUL\nExcuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?\nThe girls jump up, surprised.\nJOHN\nWeve broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!\nEh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.\nPAUL\nWill you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...\nHe starts to drag JOHN after him.\nJOHN\nI was innocent. I was framed. I wont go back.\nJOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.\nJOHN\nI bet you can guess what I was in for.\nHe cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him.\nA waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down.\nPAUL\nHow about that one?\nHe moves towards the compartment.\nPAUL\nDid you look in here?\nGEORGE\nNo. I mean, its probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.\nPAUL\nWell, lets broaden our outlook.\nPAUL opens the door of the compartment.\n13.\tINTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT\nFrom the BOYS P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.\nGRANDFATHER\nCongratulate me, boys, Im engaged.\nPAUL enters and crosses over to him.\nPAUL\nOh no, youre not. Youve gone too far this time ... and whos paying for all this?\nGRANDFATHER\nIts all taken care of. Its down on our bill.\nPAUL\nOh, well thats all right.\nWhat?\nAUDREY\nYoung man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.\nPAUL\nIm sorry, Missus, but the betrothals off.\nIll refuse me consent, hes over-age!\nAUDREY grabs GRANDFATHERs other arm and pulls back.\nAUDREY\nLeave him alone, after all hes done for you is this the way you repay him?\nA tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.\nPAUL\nHim? hes never done anything for anybody in his life.\nAUDREY\nYou dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!\nJOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.\nJOHN\nCome on, Auntie, youre winning.\nGEORGE\nGet in there, Paul, shes weakening.\nRINGO attempts to interfere.\nRINGO\nLook, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, hes ...\nAUDREY\nKeep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.\nRINGO\nYwhat?\nShe hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.\nRINGO\nHes given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. Hes got to be stopped. Its not fair.\nRINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the womans handbag.\nA voice shouts off from outside.\nVOICE OFF\nThats one of them ... stop thief!\n14.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR\nFrom Ringos P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school.\nBoth groups are closing in on the BOYS. Theres no escape.\nRINGO\nOh Mother!!\n15.\tINTERIOR LUGGAGE VAN\nVery dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing.\nIn the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene.\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!\nPAUL\nDont dramatise.\nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.\nPAUL\nLets face it, youre lucky to be here. If theyd have had their way youd have been dropped off at Stafford already.\nGRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face.\nPAUL\nWell, youve got to admit youve upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while youre stuck in here.\nGRANDFATHER turns away again.\nPAUL\nAll right, how about Ringo? I mean ... hes very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audreys concerned, shes finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...\nGRANDFATHER\nA harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.\nPAUL\nOh, its all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?\nGRANDFATHER\nYoure left-handed, arent you, Paul?\nPAUL\nYeah ... so what?\nGRANDFATHER\nWhy do you always use your left hand?\nPAUL\nWell, dont be daft, Ive got to.\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd I take a left-handed view of life, Ive got to.\nPAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of\nthe luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.\nPAUL\nShove up!\nGRANDFATHER produces a penny.\nGRANDFATHER\nOdds or evens?\nPAUL sighs.\nPAUL\nOdds.\nGRANDFATHER flips the coin.\nThe guards van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.\nJOHN\nDont worry, son, well get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.\nPAUL\nOh, its a laugh a line with Lennon.\nAnyroad up ... Its all your fault.\nRINGO\nMe? Why?\nGEORGE\nBag-snatcher.\nGRANDFATHER\nThats right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.\nJOHN\nEvery morning.\nJOHN has been looking around the guards van.\nJOHN\nGaw, its depressing in here, isnt it? Funny...\ncos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, dont they? Youd expect something a little more palatial.\nCome on. Lets have a little action. Lets do something, then.\nPAUL\nLike what?\nJOHN\nWell, Ive got me gob stopper.\nLook, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.\nAnd to RINGOs beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene.\n16.\tEXTERIOR TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE \nWhile the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London.\n17.\tEXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS \nSHOTS of the station full of GIRLS waiting for the BOYS.\n18.\tINTERIOR GUARDS VAN\nBy the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.\nNORM enters the guards van.\nNORM\nDont move, any of you. Theyve gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.\nJOHN\nPlease, can I have one to surge with?\nNORM\nNo.\nJOHN\nAh, go on, you swine.\nNORM\nNo, you cant. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car thats waiting.\nHe points and we see a big car parked across the road.\nThe BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door.\n19.\tEXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS\nJust as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.\nNORM\nOh no!\nGRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, lads, follow me.\nAnd before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him. The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward ... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls.\nJOHN\nVive lamour!\nNORM drags him away.\n20.\tEXTERIOR RAILWAY STATION\nThe BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car.\nThe BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfathers taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.\n21.\tINTERIOR BIG CAR\nNORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.\nNORM\nGo like the clappers, son!\nFRANK\nThat was my entire intention, sir.\n22.\tEXTERIOR STATION\nThe car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off.\nIt moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins.\n23.\tINTERIOR HOTEL SUITE NIGHT\nThere is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room. One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats.\nRINGO\nI dont snore.\nGEORGE\nYou do - repeatedly.\nRINGO\nDo I snore?\nJOHN\nYoure a window rattler, son.\nRINGO\nWell, thats just your opinion. Do I snore, Paul?\nPAUL\nWith a trombone hooter like yours itd be unnatural if you didnt.\nGRANDFATHER\nDont mock the afflicted, Pauly.\nPAUL\nOh for Petes sake, Its only a joke.\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, it may be a joke, but its his nose. He cant help having a horrible great nose, its the only one hes got. And his poor little heads trembling under the weight of it.\nNORM enters with three piles of fan mail and places them in front of JOHN on a table. RINGO is almost in tears, examining his nose in a mirror.\nNORM\nPaul, John, George - get at it.\nJOHN\nHello the income tax have caught up with us at last.\nPAUL and GEORGE gather round the low table. RINGO is left out of it.\nRINGO\nNone for me, then?\nNORM\nSorry.\nJohn hands RINGO a single envelope.\nJOHN\nThatll keep you busy.\nGRANDFATHER\nIts your nose, ysee. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. Theyll pick on a nose...\nRINGO\nYou go and pick on your own.\nSHAKE enters with a stack of mail about three times larger than all the others put together.\nJOHN\nIs that yours?\nSHAKE\nFor Ringo.\nHe dumps it in Ringos arms who staggers into an armchair. The BOYS send him up.\nJOHN\nThat must have cost you a fortune in stamps, Ringo.\nGEORGE\nHe comes from a large family.\nRINGO\nWell.\nRINGO opens his letter and reads it. It contains a large embossed card.\nRINGO\nEh, whats Boyds Club?\nThe lads gather round him and PAUL takes the card from him and reads.\nPAUL\nThe Management of Boyds takes pleasure in requesting the company of Mr Richard Starkey--thats you--in their recently refinished gaming rooms. Chemin de Fer. Baccarat, Roulette, and Champagne Buffet. Blimey!\nRINGO\nAnd they want me?\nJOHN\nOh, its got round that youre a heavy punter.\nNORM\nWell youre not going.\nRINGO\nAh.\nGRANDFATHER\nQuite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!\nHe pockets the card himself.\nRINGO\nThats mine.\nNORM\nHave done, and you lot get your pens out.\nBOYS\nWhy?\nNORM\nIts homework time for all you college puddings. I want this lot\nall answered tonight.\nThe BOYS all protest.\nNORM\nIll brook no denial!\nJOHN\nIts all right for you, you couldnt get a pen in your foot, you swine.\nNORM\nCome on, Shake, well leave em to their\npenmanship.\nHe goes followed by SHAKE.\nThere is a pause and JOHN deliberately rises slowly and crosses to his coat. He puts it on and walks to the door.\nJOHN\nWhile the swines away the piglets can play. Well, come on, what are we waiting for?\nWith a whoop PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO collect their coats and head for the door.\nGRANDFATHER\nWhat about all these letters?\nBOYS\nRead em!\nThey disappear. After a moment GRANDFATHER takes out Ringos card.\nC.U. GRANDFATHER\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd a free champagne buffet.\nHe grins to himself. At this moment a WAITER enters with a tray. He is clad in tails and GRANDFATHER eyes them longingly, measuring himself the while alongside the startled waiter. He leaves us with no doubt in our minds what he wants, i.e., the waiters suit.\n24.\tINTERIOR DANCING CLUB NIGHT\nThe club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers. They are recognised and given smiles and nods of encouragement\nby all the other customers. During this scene we\nCUT AWAY\n25.\tINTERIOR BOYDS CLUB NIGHT\nThe whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur suivez and banco to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.\nDEALER\nAlors, Msieur?\nGRANDFATHER\nSouflée.\nHe turns to the buxom BLONDE, who is dripping over him.\nGRANDFATHER\nI bet youre a great swimmer. My turn? Bingo!\nCROUPIER\nPas Bingo, Msieur... Banco.\nGRANDFATHER\nIll take the little darlings anyway.\nHe takes up the cards and cant understand that they are unnumbered.\nGRANDFATHER\nTwo and one is three, carry one is four.\nThe buxom BLONDE leans over him.\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\nGRANDFATHER\nEh?\nBLONDE\nLay them down.\nGRANDFATHER\nWed be thrown out.\nBLONDE\nYour cards... lay them down... face up.\nHe does so.\nCROUPIER\nHuit à la pointe... et sept.\nBLONDE\nYou had a lovely little pair, ysee.\nGRANDFATHER\nI did?\nCROUPIER taps impatiently on box .\nBLONDE\nTheyre yours.\nGRANDFATHER\nThey are?\nBLONDE\nThe cards... youre bank.\n26.\tINTERIOR DANCING CLUB\nThe BOYS are having a rare old time and the place is really moving.\n27.\tINTERIOR BOYDS CLUB\nGRANDFATHER is playing and a waiter is checking the requirements of the players.\nGRANDFATHER\nBingo!\nCROUPIER\nMlord dit Bingo.\nWAITER\nA little light refreshment.\nGRANDFATHER\nA glass of the old chablis to wash down a gesture of giblets wouldnt go amiss.\nSouflée, chop chop.\nThe CROUPIER uses the spatula to pick up a card. GRANDFATHER grabs it and scoops some sandwiches off a passing tray.\n28.\tINTERIOR DANCING CLUB\nThe BOYS are at their table again laughing and enjoying themselves, when suddenly their faces freeze.\nFrom their P.O.V. we see NORM standing glowering down at them. With him is SHAKE. Reluctantly the BOYS arise and follow NORM out.\n29.\tINTERIOR BOYDS\nGRANDFATHER is looking worried at the call of the card he loses and we see that all his chips have gone. He notices the waiter delivering snacks and champagne to a couple, so quick as a flash, he places a handkerchief over his arm and writing a bill out on a piece of paper, presents it to the couple and collects payment in chips. He then resumes playing.\n30.\tINTERIOR HOTEL ROOM\nWaiter is sitting on chair in underclothes, reading. He hears a noise, says The manager! and hides in outer clothes closet. NORM and the BOYS enter saying:\nNORM\nNow get on with it.\nJOHN\nWe were going to do it.\nNORM\nAye, well, now!\nRINGO goes to hang up coat in closet. He does so, then crosses to rest.\nRINGO\nAny of you lot put a man in that cupboard?\nALL\nA man? No.\nRINGO\nWell somebody did.\nGEORGE goes to cupboard. We see the WAITER from his P.O.V. He closes door, returns to group.\nGEORGE\nHes right, yknow.\nBOYS\nAh well, there you go.\nSHAKE enters front door, goes to hang up coat and drags WAITER out.\nSHAKE\nEh, whats all this?\nPAUL\nOh, him... Hes been lurking.\nJOHN\nAye, he looks a right lurker.\nSHAKE\nYoure undressed. Where are your clothes?\nWAITER\nThe old gentlemen borrowed them to go gambling at Boyds.\nPAUL\nNo!\nRINGO\nOh, hes gone to my club, has he?\nPAUL\nYeah, Its all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. Hes probably in the middle of an orgy by now.\nJOHN\nWell, what are we waiting for?\nSHAKE\nAye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours\nis worse than any of you lot.\n31.\tINTERIOR BOYDS\nGRANDFATHER is drinking champagne in locked arms with BLONDE.\nWAITER\nEncore de champagne, Monsieur?\nGRANDFATHER\nYes, and Ill have some more champagne as well.\nHe takes another swig of his glass.\nMANAGER\nLord John McCartney, hes the millionaire Irish Peer, filthy rich of course.\nCUSTOMER\nOh I dont know, looks rather clean to me.\nThe MANAGER comes to grandfathers side.\nMANAGER\nPlay is about to resume, mlord.\nGRANDFATHER\nLead me to it, Ive a winning itch that only success can pacify.\nHe takes his place at the table. The MANAGER watches for a moment then moves away from the table towards the club reception desk.\n32.\tINTERIOR RECEPTION DESK BOYDS CLUB\nJOHN, PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, NORM and SHAKE are trying to gain entrance.\nATTENDANT\nIm sorry sir, members and invited guests only.\nPAUL, GEORGE, RINGO, JOHN\nIve got to get in.\nIts urgent and important.\nIve had an invite.\nTake me to your leader.\nNORM\nShurrup.\nThe BOYS do and meanwhile the MANAGER has walked into SHOT. He recognises the BOYS and welcomes them with false enthusiasm. They all start to enter the main room.\nNORM\nAll we want to know is have you got a little\nold man in there?\nMANAGER\nDo you mean Lord McCartney?\nCLOSE-UP PAUL\nPAUL\nHes at it again. Look, Im his grandfather... I mean...\nBLONDE\nOh, it must be the dolly floor show.\nJOHN\nStay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.\nGRANDFATHER\nWho are these ruffians?... Ive never seen them before in my life! ... \nThey grab the protesting GRANDFATHER and drag him into the reception area. He keeps trying to return to BLONDE and table. GEORGE and RINGO each take an end of the velvet cord hanging between the two stanchions. They exchange ends and re-hook it, thus encircling GRANDFATHER by the\nentrance desk. They then go to settle up.\nMANAGER\nBefore you go, gentlemen, theres the small matter of the bill.\nHe snaps his fingers and a waiter hands him the bill.\nNORM\nIll settle that.\nHe glances at it.\nNORM\nA hundred and eighty pounds!\nMANAGER\nI beg your pardon, guineas.\nAt that moment a WAITER appears with a tray full of pound notes.\nWAITER\nYour winnings, my lord, one hundred and ninety\npounds.\nThe MANAGER tears up the bill and takes the money.\nGRANDFATHER\nHow about me change?\nMANAGER\nCloak room charge.\nHe hands GRANDFATHER his old mackintosh.\nRINGO\nAh well, easy come, easy go.\nThe others glower at him.\nRINGO\nWell.\n33.\tINTERIOR BIG CAR \nThe BOYS have settled down.\nJOHN\nShould I say it?\nGEORGE\nFollow your impulse.\nRINGO\nItll only get you into trouble.\nJOHN\nAah, shurrup, misery!\nJOHN slouches forward.\nJOHN\nO.K. Driver, follow that car!!\nThe driver is an urbane young man in a handsome grey uniform.\nFRANK\nWould you like to be a little more precise, sir?\nJOHN\nWell, thats the wrong line for a start.\nFRANK\nSorry?\nGEORGE\nOh, dont pay any attention to him, he was just fulfilling a lifelong ambition.\nFRANK\nI see.\nJOHN\nYeah, you know, O.K. Buster, follow that car, theres a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!\nFRANK\nOh, yes, now Im with you.\nBut, gee, Mister, Ive got my license to think of ... were doing a hundred now ...\nThe car is stopped in traffic behind a bus. JOHN gets out of car and walks to the front. JOHN leans in window delightedly, he flashes his wallet.\nJOHN\nEver seen one of these before?\nFRANK\nAh ... a shamus, eh?\nJOHN\nI see you go to the night court.\nFRANK\nIve made the scene.\nJOHN\nWell, remember, its Leathery Magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.\nGEORGE\nI dont think that bits right.\nJOHN\nWhat do you expect from an ad lib ... Raymond Chandler?\n34.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nAs the big car overtakes a Company Directors Rolls. JOHN lowers his window and the boys let out an imaginary hail of bullets at the Executive in the back. He reacts violently and starts to shout at them. As he does so, he presses the button of his window, so that we hear only part of it. But what we do is unpleasant. He immediately presses the button and the window rises.\nRINGO and PAUL jump out of the car. RINGO takes two drumsticks from his coat pocket and, using them as banderillas, inserts them with style into the radiator grill . PAUL, then, using his coat as a matadors cloak, does a butterfly pass at the car which\nhas just started up, narrowly missing him, but he keeps in the matador position.\n35.\tINTERIOR CAR\nNORM\nWill you all stop it, youre like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.\nJOHN\nWell, you shouldnt have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.\nFRANK\nWere nearly there, sir.\nJOHN\nEh ... dont call him sir, hes got enough delusions of power as it is.\nCLOSE SHOT of a long suffering NORM.\nNORM\nAnd I was happy in the bakery. Ill never know\nwhy I left.\n36.\tEXTERIOR OF AN OLD VICTORIAN MUSIC HALL THEATRE\nWhich has been converted to the T.V. studios.\nThere are a few groups of GIRL FANS standing outside the front of the theatre, but against the kerb of the pavement is a night-watchmans canvas hut and brazier.\nThe car approaches.\n37.\tINTERIOR OF THE CAR\nNORM\nGet ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.\nJOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchmans canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night watchman, staring in astonishment.\nAt the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.\n38.\tINTERIOR STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\nAs the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars\nand old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\nPress conference, theyre waiting for you.\nNORM\nGive us a couple of shakes to get our breath.\nFIRST P.R.O. MAN\nTheyre waiting now!\nAnd without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.\nPAUL\nEh this lot means it. Theyre even taking\nhostages.\nThe BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.\n39.\tINTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM\nIt is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them..\nNow begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS.\nEvery time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another. During the scene these individual exchanges take place:\nSOUND REPORTER\nWhats your philosophy of life?\nJOHN\nIm torn between Zen and Im all right, Jack.\nREPORTER\nHas success changed your life?\nRINGO\nYes.\nREPORTER\nDo you like playing the guitar?\nGEORGE\nNext to kissing girls its favourites.\nPAUL is surrounded by newspapermen.\nPAUL\nNo, actually, were just good friends.\nHIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.\n40.\tINTERIOR THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE\nThe BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.\nPAUL\nAnything to spare?\nGRANDFATHER\nWeve just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.\nGEORGE\nSure.\n.\nPAUL\nAh well. Eh, look!\nHe points, and from PAULS P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.\nPAUL\nLets go and muck in.\nJOHN\nAye, before anyone stops us.\nThey exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.\n41.\tINTERIOR STAGE\nEveryone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out:\nVOICE\nHere, what about these electric guitars?\nSHAKE\nWhere are they?\nVOICE\nBack here, mate.\nSHAKE\nIm coming.\nRINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.\nRINGO\nLeave them drums alone.\nFLOOR MANAGER\nOh, surely one can have a tiny touch.\nRINGO\nIf you so much as breathe heavy on them, Im\nout on strike.\nFLOOR MANAGER\nArent you being rather arbitrary?\nRINGO\nThats right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I dont go round messing about with your ear-phones, do I?\nFLOOR MANAGER\nSpoil sport!\nRINGO\nWell!\nRINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious.\nGEORGE\nHes very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.\nRINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over.\nPAUL\nWhats up?\nGEORGE\nHes sulking again.\nJOHN\nIll show him.\nHe picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAULS encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised. During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.\n42.\tINTERIOR RAMP\nAs the number finishes a baldheaded man storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle.\nDIRECTOR\nAll right Im sorry and lets hear no more about it. If thats your opinion, youre probably right. Look, if you think Im unsuitable lets have it out in the open, I cant stand these back-stage politics.\nBy the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride.\nJOHN\nArent you tending to black and white this whole situation?\nDIRECTOR\nWell, quite honestly I wasnt expecting a musical arranger who would question my ability ... picture-wise.\nJOHN\nI could listen to him for hours.\nPAUL\nHeave to, whats all this about a musical arranger?\nDIRECTOR\nMr. McCartney Senior!\nThe BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.\nGRANDFATHER\nHey Pauly, theyre trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but Ive given him the test.\nDIRECTOR\nIm quite happy to be replaced.\nGRANDFATHER\nHes a typical buck-passer.\nDIRECTOR\nI won an award.\nJOHN\nA likely story.\nDIRECTOR\nIts on the wall in my office.\nAt this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene.\nNORM\nHello our lot, everyone happy?\nThe BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently.\nNORM\nAll right, all right. If you dont need this lot, Ill lock em up in the dressing room till you do.\nDIRECTOR\nPlease do, Ill not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.\nHe glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.\nDIRECTOR\nGive me a bottle of milk and a packet of\nOblivion. Oh, its a plot, I see it now, its\nall a plot.\nThey go left towards the back-stage.\nNORM\nNow, come on, Ive got the key.\nHe leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely.\nNORM and the BOYS turn on him.\nNORM\nLets have you.\nJOHN\nCome on speedy!\nPAUL\nRingo!\nGEORGE\nWake up!\nRINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves. The BOYS pass him and go through the door. GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.\nGRANDFATHER\nI cant tell you how much Ive enjoyed your act.\nHe slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the mans coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out 10 on his sign, and writes 9 in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performers smile as he does.\n43.\tINTERIOR THEATRE BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR\nThe BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses. They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor.\nJOHN\nGear costume!\nACTOR\nSwap?\nNORM\nRight, first floor and no messing about.\nNORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, after you, No, after you. NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.\nNORM\nLennon, leave them girls alone or Ill report you.\nThe BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded by people.\n44.\tINTERIOR DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR\nRINGOS attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.\n45.\tEXTERIOR TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE\nFrom the BOYS P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind nthe theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows. Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways.\nThe BOYS scamper down the fire escape.\nWhen they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door. They open it and look through.\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.\nIt is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.\nThey look at each other and grin ... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHNS cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.\nThe four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass.\nMANS VOICE\nI suppose you know this is private property.\nThe boys freeze.\nFrom their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them. The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big mans eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man.\nJOHN\nSorry if we hurt your field, Mister.\n46.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR BACK-STAGE\nGRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm.\n47.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE UNDERNEATH THE STAGE\nUnder the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestras entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old- fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.\nThe menacing shadows appear on the stairway.\nNORM \nTheres no one here.\nSHAKE \nThis is the only way they could have gone.\nWe now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.\n48.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE\nA rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.\nBack now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each others arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.\n48A.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR AS BOYS PASS THRU ON WAY TO DRESSING ROOM\nJOHN is behind them. JOHN, BOYS and MILLIE are walking towards each other.\nMILLIE\nHello.\nJOHN\nHello.\nMILLIE\nOh, wait a minute, dont tell me youre ...\nJOHN\nNo, not me.\nMILLIE\nOh you are, I know you are.\nJOHN\nNo, Im not.\nMILLIE\nYou are.\nJOHN\nIm not, no.\nMILLIE\nWell, you look like him.\nJOHN\nOh do I? Youre the first one who ever said that.\nMILLIE\nOh you do, look.\nJOHN looks at himself in the mirror.\nJOHN examines himself in the mirror carefully.\nJOHN\nMy eyes are lighter.\nMILLIE\nOh yes.\nJOHN\nAnd my nose...\nMILLIE\nWell, yes your nose is. Very.\nJOHN\nIs it?\nMILLIE\nI would have said so.\nJOHN\nAye, but you know him well.\nMILLIE\nNo I dont, hes only a casual acquaintance.\nJOHN\nThats what you tell me.\nMILLIE\nWhat have you heard?\nJOHN\nIts all over the place, everyone knows.\nMILLIE\nIs it? Is it really?\nJOHN\nMind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldnt have it.\nMILLIE\nI knew I could rely on you.\nJOHN\nThanks.\nMILLIE touches his arm then walks away. After a moment she turns.\nMILLIE\nYou dont look like him at all.\nJOHN winks at her and she winks back.\n49.\tINTERIOR DRESSING ROOM\nNORM and SHAKE enter the room. The BOYS TAILOR is there waiting for the BOYS.\nSHAKE\nOh theyve probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.\nNORM\nThats too easy for Lennon.\nHe crosses to door leading to fire escape.\nNORM\nHes out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.\nSHAKE\nYoure imagining it. Youre letting things prey on your mind.\nNORM\nOh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.\nSHAKE\nBut John hasnt got any.\nNORM\nWhat?\nSHAKE\nNerves.\nNORM\nI know, thats the trouble.\nHe puffs nervously at his cigarette.\nNORM\nOh, Ive toyed with the idea of a ball and chain but hed only rattle them at me... and in public and all. Sometimes I think he enjoys seeing me suffer.\nHe hears something.\nNORM\nGet behind that door, theyre coming. Someones coming. Quick, hide!\nThe two men hide behind the door. The boys enter the room, as JOHN is last he shuts the door and faces SHAKE and NORM.\nJOHN\nWhat are you doing there?\nSHAKE\nHiding.\nJOHN\nI think youre soft or something.\nNORM\nWe werent hiding.\nTAILOR\nNow?\nNORM\nNow. We were trying to catch you redhanded. I thought I told you lot to stay here?\nRINGO\nWell ...\nNORM\nWhen I tell you to stay put, stay put.\nJOHN\nDont cane me, sir, I was led astray.\nNORM\nOh shurrup and come on John. Theyre waiting\nfor you in the studio.\nRINGO\nOh dear, I feel like doing a bit of work.\nNORM\nGood lad, Ringo.\nPAUL\nOh, listen to teachers pet.\nGEORGE\nYou crawler.\nJOHN\nHes betrayed the class.\nRINGO\nOh, leave off!!!\nJOHN\nTemper! Temper!\nRINGO\nWell ...\nCLOSE-UP on NORMs long suffering face.\nNORM\nWill you all get a move on! Theyre waiting for\nyou!\nBy this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGEs shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.\nJOHN\nI now declare this bridge open.\nThe BOYS run out the door.\n50.\tINTERIOR BACKSTAGE AREA\nFive beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling acts music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.\nFrom the door off stage, above which is a sign To Canteen and Production Offices, GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and\nthree. He goes to be measured with the sweater.\nFrom the onstage area, a jugglers ASSISTANT in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.\nWe CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHERs. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.\nWe hear the DIRECTORs voice.\nDIRECTOR \nAll right, hold it, hold it... O.K. John, wipe him down and well carry on with the next act.\nWe\nCUT TO\ncentre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.\nThe FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.\nWe CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTORs VOICE.\n51.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\nCLOSE-UP on the distraught DIRECTOR.\nDIRECTOR\nWhere are they? I said, where are they? Where are they?\nFLOOR MANAGER\nTheyre coming, I promise you.\nDIRECTOR\nNow look, if theyre not here on this floor in thirty seconds theres going to be trouble ... understand me ... trouble!!!\nTwo STAGE HANDS are walking disinterestedly past, they look at the DIRECTOR.\n1st STAGE HAND\nWhats he on about, Taff?\nWELSH STAGE HAND\nWell ... hes being the director. Of course, he lives in a world of his own, mind.\nAt this moment the boys, NORM, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER appear. The BOYS grab their instruments and prepare to play.\nJOHN\nStanding about, eh? Some people have it dead easy, dont they?\nThe director is about to blow his top but manages to hold on and mutter to the heavens.\nDIRECTOR\nOf course, once youre over thirty, youre finished. Its a young mans medium and I just cant take the pace.\nRINGO\nAre you as young as that, then?\nBOYS\nShurrup!\nGRANDFATHER\nIsnt it always the way? Picking on us little fellas.\nPAUL\nShove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?\nSHAKE\nIm an electrician, not a wet nurse, yknow.\nPAUL\nIll set John on you!\nSHAKE\nOh, anything you say, Paul.\nHe leads GRANDFATHER away.\nThe BOYS are placed in position, instruments ready. The boom moves in near them. There is a mike hovering just over JOHNS head. JOHN starts attacking it.\nDIRECTORS VOICE \nRun through the number and try not to jiggle out of your positions.\nThe BOYS start the number, as the stage hands adjust their settings. When theyve finished, they stand about spare.\n52.\tINTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM\nThe room is crowded with the usual personnel, P.A., elecs, racks, etc.... make-up supervisor and wardrobe mistress.\nDIRECTOR\nThat was more or less all right for me. Ill give them one more run through then leave them alone until the dress ...\nOh how about make-up?\nMAKE-UP WOMAN\nNot really, they dont need it any. Well just powder them off for shine.\nDIRECTOR\nGood. Norm, get them along to make-up will you?\nNORM\nSure.\nDIRECTOR\nAnd hurry, theyre not looking too happy.\nFrom the directors P.O.V. we see into the monitor. The boys crowding around RINGO. We cut through the monitor into the same position in the studio.\n53.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\nPAUL\nWhats the matter with you? You were bashing away like a madman.\nRINGO\nYou were twanging too loud.\nJOHN\nHowd you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?\nGEORGE\nYoure getting out of hand. I dont know whats come over you today.\nRINGO\nThats right. Its always me, isnt it?\nJOHN\nSince you ask, yes.\nAah, come on, Ring, we love you.\nHe puts his arm around Ringos shoulder.\nRINGO\nWell!\nJOHN\nHell get over it.\nNORM appears down the ramp speaking as he approaches.\nNORM\nAll right, our lot, make-up.\n54.\tINTERIOR MAKE UP ROOM\nA smallish room with a line of chairs facing a wall mirror and a long table. Each place is clearly marked and above each mirror a girls name: Betty, Angela, Deirdre, Jenny.\nSHAKE and GRANDFATHER are sitting in splendid isolation. They are staring each other out.\nSHAKE\nYou blinked!\nGRANDFATHER\nI never did, you did.\nThe BOYS enter.\nSHAKE\nHello, hes not talking to me. Hes having a sulk.\nGEORGE\nWell, it must be catching. Hes given it to the\nchamp here.\nHe indicates RINGO who ignores him.\nNORM\nStop picking on him.\nRINGO\nI dont need you to defend me, yknow, Norm.\nJOHN\nLeave him alone, hes got swine fever.\nNORM\nSit down, the lot of you.\nAt this moment several actors come into the room. They are all dressed in the uniform of officers in Wellingtons army. Together with the boys they sit down, Beatles and soldiers all mixed up.\nNow a group of several pretty make-up girls make an entrance and the boys herald their arrival with a chorus of aye ayes and wolf whistles. JOHN meanwhile has helped himself to a big beard and the other lads are generally messing about with assorted make-up things.\nHEAD MAKE UP GIRL\nOh, this is impossible! Well never get you all done in time.\nACTOR\nWell, youll just have to do us first... It makes no difference to them whether theyre made up or not.\nAnd whos me, then?\nJOHN\nMy names Betty...\nDo you want a punch up your frogged tunic?\nNORM fights his way to JOHN.\nNORM\nNow listen, John, behave yourself or Ill murder you and, Shake, take that wig off, it suits you.\nSHAKE has a long blond girls wig on. With the assistance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsmans busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of Queen Magazine.\nNORM\nWhat do you think are youre up to?\nRINGO\nSomeone put it on me.\nJOHN\nExcuses, thats all we get and you know you fancy yourself in the Coldstreams.\nThe GIRLS now move in and put make up bibs on the BOYS and start to powder them off.\nJOHN\nYou wont interfere with the basic rugged\nconcept of my personality, will you, girl?\nPAUL\nEh, dont take out me lines.\nGEORGE\nYeah, they give him that Je ne sais quoi\nrakish air.\nThe lads laugh with pleasure.\nRINGO decides to try a little joke.\nRINGO\n(indicating the busby he is still\nwearing)\nShort back and sides, please.\nThe other look at him with mock disgust.\nPAUL\nBehave...\nJOHN\nForeign devil ...\nGEORGE\nControl yourself...\nGRANDFATHER has been watching the powdering process.\nGRANDFATHER\nIn my considered opinion youre a bunch of sissies.\nJOHN grabs a powder puff from his girl.\nJOHN\nYou know youre only jealous!\nAnd dabs the old man liberally with the powder much to GRANDFATHERs annoyance.\nNORM\nLeave him alone, Lennon, or Ill tell them all the truth about you.\nJOHN\nYou wouldnt!\nNORM\nI would though.\nNORM goes out.\nPAUL\nWhats he know?\nJOHN\nNothing, hes trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, hes a swine but a clever swine, mind.\nGRANDFATHER\nLookit, I thought I was supposed to be getting a change of scenery and so far Ive seen a train and a room, a car and a room and a room and a room. Well, thats maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but Im feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp. Im a frustrated man and that class of McCartney is a dangerous McCartney.\nGIRL\nWhat a clean old man.\nGRANDFATHER\nYoure too young for a fella of my cosmopolitan tastes, so dont press your luck.\nJOHN\nHes sex-obsessed, the older generation are leading this country to galloping ruin.\nNORM returns leaving the door open, the boys hear the sound of music coming from the studio.\nNORM\nTheyre nearly ready for you. Theyre just finishing the band call.\nJOHN\nGear! Come on, girls, lets have a bit of a dance.\nJOHNS GIRL\nI dont think its allowed.\nJOHN\nWell ... it wouldnt be any fun if it was!\nThe BOYS drag the make-up GIRLS out of the room and into the studio.\nThe GIRLS are still trying to finish making the BOYS up.\nAs the BOYS and MAKE-UP GIRLS dance past, we see one of the Strauss singers combing his long hair straight back. Two STAGE HANDS swing a wind machine past him and his hair is blown straight forward into a Beatle cut.\nJOHN\nNever.\nDuring dance, GEORGE takes off wig and places it on dummy, revealing identical hair underneath.\n55.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\nThe work is still going on and the music is up full blast, the BOYS enter and with the GIRLS they start a wild dance, hippy, shake, zulu, blue beat, the lot. LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage ... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.\n56.\tINTERIOR CONTROL ROOM\nThe whole control room crew are watching the dance on all the monitors. The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.\nWe now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.\nSo we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.\nWhen the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.\n57.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO FLOOR\nDIRECTORS VOICE OVER TANNOY\nThank you gentlemen, you can break now while we push on with the show.\nThe boys acknowledge this with a quaver of guitar chords and a drum roll.\nNORM is on them at once.\nNORM\nThat was great, youve got about an hour but dont leave the theatre.\nJOHN grabs the arm of a sexy girl dancer.\nJOHN\nShes going to show me her stamp collection.\nPAUL\nSos mine.\nNORM\nJohn, Im talking to you. This final run through is important. Understand? Important.\nJOHN\nOink! Oink!\nThey dash off with the two beauties.\nGRANDFATHER is hovering in the background with SHAKE.\nGRANDFATHER\nI want me cup of tea.\nNORM\nShake.\nSHAKE\nIm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.\nNORM\nClever.\nGeorge.\nBut GEORGE is disappearing out of the door.\nNORM turns to RINGO.\nNORM\nLook after him.\nRINGO\nBut...\nNORM\nDo I have to raise me voice?\nRINGO\nOh, all right. Come here, Grandad.\nAnd the two of them walk off, Ringo leading.\n57A.\tINTERIOR BACKSTAGE\nA man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.\nGRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.\nWe\nCUT TO\nTHE HEAD-PLAYER being patted on the back. The ball drops out of his mouth and bounces slowly on the studio floor.\n58.\tINTERIOR T.V. STUDIO CANTEEN\nThe canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHERs eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.\nGRANDFATHER\nWill you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!\nRINGO\nWell ... whats the matter with that?\nGRANDFATHER\nHave you no natural resources of your own? Have they even robbed you of that?\nRINGO\nYou can learn from books.\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you now? Aah ... sheeps heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.\nRINGO\nOut where?\nGRANDFATHER\nAny old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When youre not thumping them pagan skins, youre tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!\nRINGO\nBooks are good!\nGRANDFATHER\nParadings better!\nRINGO\nParading?\nGRANDFATHER\nThats it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!\nRINGO\nWell, I am living, arent I?\nGRANDFATHER\nYoure living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?\nRINGO\nEh ... youre a bit old for that sort of chat, arent you?\nGRANDFATHER\nAt least Ive a backlog of memories, but all youve got is that book!\nRINGO\nAaah ... stop picking on me... youre as bad as the rest of them.\nGRANDFATHER\nSo you are a man after all.\nRINGO\nWhats that mean?\nGRANDFATHER\nDo you think I havent noticed ... do you think I wasnt aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, theyve driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.\nRINGO\nOh ... I dunno.\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd that lots never happier than when theyre jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, Id like to know.\nRINGO\nYeah ... thats right.\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd whats it all come to in the end?\nRINGO\nYeah ... whats in it for me?\nGRANDFATHER\nA book!\nRINGO\nYeah ... a bloomin book!\nHe throws the book down.\nGRANDFATHER\nWhen you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before youre too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to lifes goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioners a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.\nRINGO\nYeah ... funny really, cos Id never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesnt it?\nGRANDFATHER\nYoure only right.\nRINGO\nIm not wrong.\nThere is a pause, then RINGO rises and crosses to the door.\nGRANDFATHER\nWhere are you off to?\nRINGO\nIm going parading before its too late!\nRINGO leaves and GRANDFATHER laughs at what he has done, then realizes its full meaning and looks worried.\n59.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR and STAIRWAY\nRINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.\nGEORGE\nEh, Ringo, do you know what happened to me?\nRINGO\nNo. I dont.\nAs he goes round the corner RINGO turns on the surprised GEORGE.\nRINGO\nYou want to stop being so scornful, its twisting your face.\n60.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOORMANS OFFICE\nJOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.\nJOHN\nHere he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.\nRINGO looks at JOHN hard.\nPAUL\nEh. I thought you were looking after the old man.\nRINGO\nGet knotted!\nPAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street.\nPAUL\nWeve got only half an hour till the final run-through. He cant walk out on us.\nJOHN\nCant he? Hes done it, son!\nGEORGE runs towards them.\nGEORGE\nEh, I dont know if you realise it, but ...\nPAUL\nWe do.\nGEORGE\nYes. Your grandfathers stirred him up.\nPAUL\nHe hasnt.\nGEORGE\nYes, hes filled his head with notions seemingly.\nPAUL\nThe old mixer, come on well have to put him right.\nThe three of them go into the street.\n61.\tEXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE\nThe boys look up and down but RINGO has completely disappeared.\nPAUL\nWell split up and search for him, he cant be far.\nThey now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way.\nJOHN\nIts happened at last, weve become a limited company.\nGEORGE\nIll look in here again.\nPAUL gives him a push to the left and GEORGE to the right and going straight ahead himself they part and go their separate ways.\n62.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nRINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street. He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying We Buy Anything and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who dont recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him.\nRINGO\nHello.\nGIRL\nGet out of it, short house!\nCLOSE-UP on Ringos secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road.\n63.\tEXTERIOR TOW PATH CANAL\nRINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesnt budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.\nPOLICEMAN\nAint you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.\nBefore RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.\nRINGO\nSoutherner!\nHe looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO.\nBOY\nHere, mate, thats my hoop, stop playing with it.\nRINGO\nHoop, this isnt a hoop, its a lethal weapon. Have you got a licence for it?\nBOY\nOh dont be so stroppy!\nRINGO\nWell! A boy of your age bowling hoop at people. How old are you anyway?\nBOY\nNine.\nRINGO\nBet youre only eight and a half.\nBOY\nEight and two thirds.\nRINGO\nWell, there you are and watch it with that hoop.\nBOY\nGerron out of it, youre only jealous cause youre old.\nRINGO\nShurrup!\nBOY\nI bet youre\n-- sixteen!\nRINGO\nFifteen and two thirds, actually.\nBOY\nWell --\nRINGO\nAll right, take your hoop and bowl.\nHe moves off and the BOY follows.\nBOY\nOh you can have it, Im packing it in -- it depresses me.\nRINGO\nYwhat?\nBOY\nYou heard, it gets on my wick.\nRINGO\nWell thats lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why arent you at school?\nBOY\nIm a deserter.\nRINGO\nAre you now?\nBOY\nYeah, Ive blown school out.\nRINGO\nJust you?\nBOY\nNo, Ginger, Eddy Fallon and Ding Dong.\nRINGO\nDing Dong? Oh Ding Dong Bell, eh?\nBOY\nYeah, thats right, they was supposed to come\nwith us but they chickened.\nRINGO\nYeah? And theyre your mates are they?\nBOY\nYeah.\nRINGO\nNot much cop without em, is it?\nBOY\nOh, its all right.\nRINGO\nYeah?\nBOY\nYeah.\nRINGO\nWhat they like?\nBOY is glad to have something to talk about.\nBOY\nGingers mad, he says things all the time and Eddys good at punching and spitting.\nRINGO\nHow about Ding Dong?\nBOY\nHes a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know its all right cos hes one of the gang.\nRINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.\nBOY\nWhy arent you at work?\nRINGO\nIm a deserter, too.\nBOY\nOh.\nAt this moment a childs voice shouts out Charley and from RINGOS P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly.\nBOY\nSee you.\nThe BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.\n64.\tINTERIOR CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE\nGEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying Canteen and Production Office Opposite. He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre. He enters building.\n65.\tINTERIOR OFFICE\nIt is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once.\nSECRETARY\nOh, there you are!\nGEORGE\nOh, Im sorry, I must have made a mistake.\nSECRETARY\nYou havent, youre just late.\nOh, yes, hes going to be very pleased with you.\nGEORGE\nIs he?\nSECRETARY\nYes, youre quite a feather in the cap.\nHello, Ive got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.\nOf course, right away.\nShe crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL ... she opens it.\nSECRETARY\nWell ... come on.\nGEORGE\nSorry.\nHe follows her quickly in.\n66.\tINTERIOR THE INNER OFFICE\nA large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queens magazine decor.\nBehind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl. Across the poster is printed, Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal.\nSECRETARY\nWill this do, Simon?\nSIMON\nNot bad, dolly, not really bad.\nTurn around, chicky baby.\nGEORGE does so.\nSIMON\nOh yes, a definite poss. Hell look good alongside Susan.\nAll right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Dont breathe on me, Adrian.\nADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.\nGEORGE\nLook, Im terribly sorry but Im afraid theres been some sort of a misunderstanding.\nSIMON\nOh, you can come off it with us. You dont have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.\nGEORGE\nIm afraid I dont understand.\nSIMON\nOh, my God, hes a natural.\nSECRETARY \nWell, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.\nSIMON\nThey ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still hes a good type.\nHe now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots.\nSIMON\nWe want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.\nGEORGE\nOh, by all means, Id be quite prepared for that eventuality.\nSIMON\nWell, not your real opinion, naturally. Itll be written out and youll learn it.\nCan he read?\nGEORGE\nOf course I can.\nSIMON\nI mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?\nGEORGE\nIll have a bash.\nSIMON\nGood. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?\nGEORGE\nTa.\nSIMON\nWell, at least hes polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.\nA collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.\nSIMON\nNow, youll like these. You really dig them. Theyre fab and all the other pimply hyperboles.\nGEORGE\nI wouldnt be seen dead in them. Theyre dead grotty.\nSIMON\nGrotty?\nGEORGE\nYeah, grotesque.\nSIMON\nMake a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think its rather touching really. Heres this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks hell be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isnt wearing one of these nasty things. Of course theyre grotty, you wretched nit, thats why they were designed, but thats what youll want.\nGEORGE\nBut I wont.\nSIMON\nYou can be replaced you know, chicky baby.\nGEORGE\nI dont care.\nSIMON\nAnd that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you wont meet Susan if you dont cooperate.\nGEORGE\nAnd whos this Susan when shes at home?\nSIMON\nOnly Susan Campey, our resident teenager. Youll have to love her. Shes your symbol.\nGEORGE\nOh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?\nSIMON\nI beg your pardon?\nGEORGE\nOh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.\nSIMON\nShes a trend setter. Its her profession!\nGEORGE\nShes a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.\nSIMON\nGet him out of here!!\nGEORGE\nHave I said something amiss?\nSIMON\nGet him out of here. Hes knocking the programmes image!!\nThe underlings hustle GEORGE to the door.\nGEORGE\nSorry about the shirts.\nHe is ejected through the door.\nSIMON\nGet him out.\nYou dont think hes a new phenomenon, do you?\nSECRETARY\nYou mean an early clue to the new direction?\nSIMON\nWheres the calendar?\nNo, hes just a trouble maker. The change isnt due for three weeks. All the same, make a note not to extend Susans contract. Lets not take any unnecessary chances!\n67.\tEXTERIOR STREET PUB ON THE CORNER\nThe sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.\n68.\tINTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM\nThe atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.\nGRANDFATHER\nIm sorry lads, I didnt mean it, honest.\nDIRECTOR\nIf he says that again, Ill strike him.\nSHAKE\nTheyll be back, theyre good lads, theyll be back.\nDIRECTOR\nYes? Well theyve got only ten minutes to the final run-through.\nGRANDFATHER\nI meant no harm. I was only trying to encourage little Ringo to enjoy himself.\nNORM\nGod knows what youve unleashed on the unsuspecting South. Itll be wine, women and song all the way with Ringo once hes got the taste for it.\n69.\tINT. PUB PUBLIC BAR\nCLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his hand.\nBARMAID\nThat was fresh this morning.\nWe now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints. RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, theyve an average height of over six-foot. There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.\nNear the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby.\nBARMAID\nThatll be two and nine...\nRINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringos glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs\naway, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration. The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.\nBARMAID\nRight ... On your way!\nRINGO\nYwhat?\nBARMAID\nYou heard, on your way, troublemaker!\nNow the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door ...\n70.\tEXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE PUB\nRINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious.\n71.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nPAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, TV Rehearsal Room. As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.\n72.\tINTERIOR HALL\nPAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.\n73.\tINTERIOR REHEARSAL ROOM\nPAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period ... her youth however makes it all very charming.\nGIRL\nIf I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problems Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.\nShe dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.\nGIRL\nOh!\nPAUL\nWell ... go head, do the next bit.\nGIRL\nGo away! Youve spoilt it.\nPAUL\nOh, sorry I spoke.\nHe makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.\nGIRL\nAre you supposed to be here?\nPAUL\nIve got you worried, havent I?\nGIRL\nIm warning you, theyll be back in a minute.\nPAUL\nDyou know something, They dont worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... thats all but if it worries you ... well ...\nGIRL\nYoure from Liverpool, arent you?\nPAUL\nHowd you guess?\nGIRL\nOh, its the way you talk.\nPAUL\nIs it ... is it, really?\nGIRL\nAre you pulling my leg?\nPAUL\nSomething like that.\nGIRL\nI see.\nDo you like the play?\nPAUL\nYeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.\nYeah, its gear on a girl.\nGIRL\nGear?\nPAUL\nAye, the big hammer, smashing!\nGIRL\nThank you.\nPAUL\nDont mench ... well, why dont you give us a few more lines, like?\nGIRL pouts.\nPAUL\nYou dont half slam the door in peoples faces, do you? I mean, what about when youre playing the part, like, hundreds of peoplell see you and ...\nGIRL\nIm not ...\nPAUL\nOh, youre the understudy, sort of thing?\nGIRL\nNo.\nIm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.\nPAUL\nOh, I see. You are an actress though, arent you?\nGIRL\nYes.\nPAUL\nAye, I knew you were.\nGIRL\nWhats that mean?\nPAUL\nWell, the way you were spouting, like ....\nI dont believe you, sir... and all that. Yeah, it was gear.\nGIRL\nThe big hammer?\nPAUL\nOh aye, a sledge.\nGIRL\nBut the way you did it then sounded so phony.\nPAUL\nNo ... I wouldnt say that ... just like an actress ... you know.\nHe moves and stands about like an actress.\nGIRL\nBut thats not like a real person at all.\nPAUL\nAye well, actresses arent like real people, are they?\nGIRL\nThey ought to be.\nPAUL\nOh, I dont know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?\nGIRL\nWhat are you?\nPAUL\nIm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.\nGIRL\nI bet you dont sound like real people.\nPAUL\nWe do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. Its fab.\nGIRL\nIs it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?\nPAUL\nWhat of? Look, I wouldnt do it unless I was. Im dead lucky cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.\nHe laughs and with a gesture takes in the whole studio\nPAUL\n... all this and a jam butty too!!\nGIRL\nI only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.\nPAUL\nWhy? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?\nGIRL\nWhy selfish?\nPAUL\nWell, youve got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.\nShe looks at him in surprise.\nPAUL\nNo, hang on, Ive not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When Id done she said to me, Go and give some to the other kids. So, I said I would but I thought to meself, She must think Im soft. Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didnt nmind, mind, cos Id made the stuff in the first place. Well ... thats why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?\nGIRL\nNot really but Im probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?\nPAUL\nWell, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, shes a bit of a scrubber, isnt she?\nGIRL\nIs she?\nPAUL\nOf course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...\nEh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, its got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Ywhat? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly its love and were stopping in an empty shop doorway. Youre just after me body and ycant have it ... so there!!\nGIRL\nAnd you honestly think thats what she meant?\nPAUL\nOh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, shes trying to get him to marry her but he doesnt want ... well ... I dont reckon any fellas ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. Youve got to laugh.\nHe laughs.\nGIRL\nWell, its nice to know you think were clever.\nPAUL\nAnd cunning.\nGIRL\nAnd what do you do about it?\nPAUL\nMe? Oh, I dont have the time, Im always running about with the lads ... no, we dont have the time.\nGIRL\nPity.\nPAUL\nAye, it is but as long as you get by, its all right, you know ... bash on, happy valleys when they let you stop. Anyroad, Id better get back.\nGIRL\nYes.\nPAUL\nSee you.\nGIRL\nOf course.\nPAUL stands at the doorway, shrugs then goes out.\n74.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nIn the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around. In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole. At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workmans arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears he looks at his wife in the workmans arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.\n77.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE NEAR STAGE DOOR\nThe DIRECTOR is pacing up and down the corridor. NORM is also walking up and down, SHAKE is leaning against the wall quite unconcerned. NORM gives SHAKE a push.\nNORM\nWorry, will you!\nSHAKE adjusts his features to a worrying expression.\nDIRECTOR\nWell, thats it, two minutes to the final run-through... theyre bound to miss it...\nNORM\nIll murder that Lennon.\nDIRECTOR\nBut I suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...\nSHAKE\n... as they head up for the show. Oh yes, well I mean itud be a pity to miss the show, wouldnt it like.\nNORM\nShurrup, cheerful.\nThe horrible prospect hits the DIRECTOR.\nDIRECTOR\nYou dont think...\nNORM\nTheyll be here.\nDIRECTOR\nOh now, they cant do that to me.\nIts all your fault.\nOh yes it is and if they dont turn up I wouldnt be in your shoes for all the...\nSHAKE\n... tea in China. Oh youre right, neither would I.\nHe steps away from NORM and stands near the DIRECTOR.\nNORM\nTraitor!\nSHAKE nods his agreement to this assessment of his character.\nSHAKE\nOf course.\nAt this moment JOHN, GEORGE and PAUL enter from the stage door. They are completely unconcerned and walk past the DIRECTOR, SHAKE and NORM.\nJOHN\nHi Norm!\nNORM\nHi, our lot!\nThe BOYS walk on when after a moment NORM snaps to.\nNORM\nOur lot!\nGEORGE\nDid you want something.\nNORM\nI could eat the lot of you.\nJOHN\nYoud look gear with an apple in your gob.\nDIRECTOR\nDo you realise you could have missed the final run-through?\nGEORGE\nSorry.\nSHAKE\nEh, theres only three of them.\nPAUL\nAye, we were looking for Ringo. But we realised he must have come back.\nDIRECTOR\nDo you realise we are on the air, live, in front of an audience, in forty-five minutes and youre one short.\nJOHN\nControl yourself or youll spurt. Hes bound to be somewhere.\nNORM\nAye, lets try the dressing room.\nEveryone starts along the passage. NORM and PAUL last.\nPAUL\nEh, wheres my grandfather?\nNORM\nDont worry about him. He can look after himself.\nPAUL\nAye, I suppose so.\nThey run after the others.\n78.\tEXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE CLOSE-UP\nGRANDFATHER\nHere they are, personally signed and handwritten by your own sweet boys. The chance of a lifetime. Be the envy of your less fortunate sisters!\nThe CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs. On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.\n79.\tINTERIOR POLICE STATION\nIt is the reception desk and behind it is the DESK SERGEANT. After a moment RINGO is dragged in by the POLICEMAN we saw him with before.\nRINGO\nLook, Im Ringo Starr... Ive got a show to do in a few minutes youve got to let me go... Im Ringo...\nPOLICEMAN\nSure, they all say that these days ... Anyway ... I dont care who you are... you can save that for the stipendary. Here you are, Sarge.\nSERGEANT\nWhat is he?\nPOLICEMAN\nIve got a little list here. Wandering abroad. Malicious intent. Acting in a suspicious manner. Conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. You name it, hes done it.\nSERGEANT\nOh, a little savage, is he?\nPOLICEMAN\nA proper Aborigine.\nRINGO\nI demand to see me solicitor.\nSERGEANT\nWhats his name?\nRINGO\nOh, well if youre going to get technical --\nAt that moment there is a loud series of noises off camera, furious shouting and dull crashes of wood.\nSERGEANT\nHello, its going to be one of those nights, is it?\nSit Charley Peace down over there.\nThe POLICEMAN takes RINGO to a bench and sits him down as GRANDFATHER and the two POLICEMEN who were with him enter. The sign is tattered and is being lugged after them.\nGRANDFATHER\nWell, you got me here so do your worst but Ill take one of you with me.\nOh, I know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but Ill defy you still.\nSERGEANT\nIs there a fire, then?\nGRANDFATHER leans across the desk and hisses at the SERGEANT.\nGRANDFATHER\nYou ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated British kisser.\nSERGEANT\nEh?\nGRANDFATHER\nIll go on a hunger strike. I know your caper. The kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. The third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.\nSERGEANT\nWhats he on about?\nGRANDFATHER\nIm soldier of the Republic, youll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.\nSERGEANT\nGet Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.\nThe POLICEMEN hurtle GRANDFATHER firmly but gently over to the bench on which RINGO is sitting and then return to the desk for a whispered conference with the SERGEANT. Meanwhile in full conspiratorial fashion GRANDFATHER talks to RINGO out of the side of his mouth.\nGRANDFATHER\nRingo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?\nRINGO\nWell Im not exactly a voluntary patient.\nGRANDFATHER\nShush! Have they roughed you up yet?\nRINGO\nWhat?\nGRANDFATHER\nKeep your voice down, this lotll paste you, just for the exercise. Oh theyre a desperate crew of drippings and theyve fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.\nRINGO\nHave they?\nGRANDFATHER\nThat sergeants a body-blow veteran if ever I measured one. One of us has got to escape. Ill get the boys. Hold on son, Ill be back for you.\nRINGO\nMe!\nGRANDFATHER\nAnd if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.\nRINGO\nOh, they seem all right to me.\nGRANDFATHER\nThats what they want you to think. All coppers are villains.\nSERGEANT\nWould you two like a cup of tea?\nGRANDFATHER\nYou see, sly villains.\nRINGO\nNo thanks, Mr. Sergeant, sir.\nWe now have a CLOSE SHOT of POLICEMEN around the sergeants desk.\nSERGEANT\nSo you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.\nPOLICEMAN\nYeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.\nSERGEANT\nWell, he cant stop here.\nShot of GRANDFATHER watching POLICEMEN intently and muttering words as he does.\nRINGO\nWhat are you doing?\nGRANDFATHER\nLip reading.\nRINGO\nWhat are they saying?\nGRANDFATHER\nNothing good.\nThe POLICEMEN make a move towards GRANDFATHER and RINGO.\nGRANDFATHER\nWell son, its now or never.\nHe jumps to his feet and scurries towards the door.\nGRANDFATHER\nAll right, you paid assassins. Johnny McCartneyll give you a run for your threepence hapenny.\nHe dashes out of the door followed by the POLICEMAN who has his pile of photos.\nSERGEANT\nNow, whats he up to?\nRINGO\nHes allergic to Bobbies, especially English Bobbies.\nThe POLICEMAN with the photos returns.\nPOLICEMAN\nYour man disappeared like a leveret over a hill.\nRINGO\nTurncoat!\nThe POLICEMEN turn on RINGO and walk towards him.\nCLOSE-UP RINGO\nRINGO\nMother!\n80.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nGRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.\nCLOSE-UP GRANDFATHERs horrified face.\nGRANDFATHER\nBe God, theyve called up reinforcements, the dragnets out!\nHe dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear-head attack force.\nThey smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.\n81.\tINTERIOR T.V. THEATRE CONTROL ROOM\nDIRECTOR\nOnly half an hour and youre on!\nGEORGE\nCan I say something?\nThe director clutches at any straw.\nDIRECTOR\nYes, anything.\nGEORGE\nIts highly unlikely well be on... I mean the law of averages are against you and it seems that, etc., etc....\nBut his speech is drowned by the pitiful moans of the DIRECTOR.\n82.\tEXTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE DOOR\nThe four little boys from the canal are being driven away by the\nsecurity guard.\nGUARD\nIll have the hides off of you lot.\nThe kids retreat as GRANDFATHER pants into shot, ignoring the kids he enters the stage door but in a second he is out again, grasped firmly by the collar by the security guard.\nGUARD\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself. Go home!\nGRANDFATHER\nI must see Pauly.\nGUARD\nGo home then and see him on the telly.\nThe GUARD re-enters the stage door.\nGRANDFATHER looks around him and sees the four kids. He hustles over and after a whispered conference we hear his offer.\nGRANDFATHER\nCan you fix him for me?\nBOYS\nYeah.\nGRANDFATHER\nSixpence.\nBOY\nEach?\nGRANDFATHER is about to argue.\nGRANDFATHER\nOh, all right.\nBOY\nAnd in advance.\nGRANDFATHER\nMercenary!\nBut he hands over the money. The kids rush in the stage door and after a moment the furious GUARD chases them out and down the alley. GRANDFATHER, chuckling, nips in the door.\n83.\tINTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM ON STAGE\nGRANDFATHER is being chased by several studio attendants; he is dodging behind equipment. He finally gets on a sound boom trolley and uses it as a weapon to keep his pursuers at bay.\n84.\tINTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM\nThe DIRECTOR, BOYS, and NORM and SHAKE see GRANDFATHER on the monitors. They dash out of the room and on to the stage.\nDIRECTOR\nIts all right, leave him alone.\nPAUL\nGrandad, wheres Ringo?\nGRANDFATHER\nThe police have the poor unfortunate lad in the Bridewell.\nBOYS\nThe police station.\nGRANDFATHER\nHell be pulp by now.\nJOHN\nWhat are we waiting for?\nGEORGE\nCome here.\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE rush off.\nCLOSE-UP DIRECTOR\nDIRECTOR\nWeve only got twenty minutes.\n85.\tEXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE POLICE STATION\nPAUL, JOHN and GEORGE come running down the street in single file, their knees high in the air, they skid to a halt at the police station and without pausing they dash inside. After a moment they reappear -- only this time RINGO is behind them. They dash off down the street. They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen. When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.\n86.\tINTERIOR POLICE STATION\nThe DESK SERGEANT is standing behind his desk looking very surprised. At this moment the boys run in and stand panting in front of the desk. Before the SERGEANT can start speaking the pursuing POLICEMEN arrive. They, too, are out of breath.\nSERGEANT\nWhat is all this?\nJOHN\nHold on until we get our breath.\nThe BOYS and POLICEMEN pant on until JOHN seems to have recovered.\nSERGEANT\nAll right now?\nJOHN\nSure.\nReady?\nThe BOYS nod and without further ado they turn and run through the surprised rank of POLICEMEN and out into the street.\n87.\tEXTERIOR STREET\nTHE CHASE CARRIES ON.\nShots of BOYS being pursued by police, including the sergeant with one shot where the BOYS are chasing the POLICEMEN. Finally, as they approach the theatre, they are seen by the girl fans who swarm around the police, over running them. The boys grin to each other and are about to make off when from their P.O.V. we see the INSPECTOR and POLICEMEN blocking it.\nJOHN\nAh well, it was worth a try.\nINSPECTOR\nWhat do you think youre up to?\nSERGEANT\nArrest those boys, sir.\nINSPECTOR\nThats all we need to start a real riot!\nCome on lads, theyre waiting for you.\n###\tINTERIOR THEATRE BACKSTAGE\nThe Inspector now hustles the BOYS through the crowds and in through the main entrance of the theatre where SHAKE and NORM are waiting. NORM looks suspiciously at RINGO who is still wearing his cap. RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on.\nDIRECTOR\nBoys, you dont know what this means to me. If you hadnt come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in Welsh for life.\nNORM\nArent you supposed to be in that box?\nThe DIRECTOR gives NORM a final glare and dashes off.\nPAUL\nAnd another thing, wheres that old mixer?\nGRANDFATHER\nHere, Pauly.\nAnd sitting on a box sadly chastened sits GRANDFATHER.\nPAUL\nWell, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.\nJOHN\nAw, leave him alone Paul, hes back, isnt he? And its not his fault hes old.\nPAUL\nWhats old got to do with it?\nJOHN\nYou neednt bother.\nPAUL\nYwhat?\nJOHN\nPractising to be thick-headed, youre there already.\nPAUL\nLook hes a mixer and a trouble maker!\nJOHN\nThats right, but hes only asking us to pay attention to him, arent you?\nFrom JOHNs P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER. He looks what he is, a tired old man.\nJOHN\nYou see.\nYou know your trouble -- you should have gone West to America. Youd have wound up a Senior Citizen of Boston. As it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, youre a lonely old man from Liverpool.\nGRANDFATHER\nBut Im clean.\nThe BOYS giggle and slap him on the back.\n88.\tINTERIOR TV THEATRE AUDITORIUM\nWe see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audiences screams. During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORMS P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself. The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again. As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHERs disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows.\n89.\tINTERIOR STUDIO CORRIDOR\nNORM is waiting for the boys. With him are two studio attendants carrying the boys luggage. As the BOYS excitedly appear he speaks to hem.\nNORM\nIve got the stuff. Come here.\nPAUL\nArent we ...\nNORM\nNo, were not!\nHe hurries them along.\nNORM\nThe office was on the phone, they think itd be better if we pushed straight to Wolverhampton.\nJOHN\nTonight? We cant make it ...\nNORM\nYouve got a midnight matinee.\nJOHN\nNow, look here, Norm ...\nNORM\nNo, you look here, John. Ive only one thing to say to you.\nJOHN\nWhat?\nNORM\nYoure a swine. So hurry up ... were travelling!\nNORM turns down a side exit where the door is open to the field. In it is an eight-passenger helicopter.\n90.\tEXTERIOR STAGE DOOR T.V. THEATRE\nThe BOYS and NORM come out of the building and start to run towards the helicopter.\nPAUL\nWheres my grandfather?\nNORM\nDont start. Look.\nThe boys look in the passenger bay and there is GRANDFATHER. He is still handcuffed to SHAKE but clutching his pile of photos.\nGRANDFATHER\nCome on, youre hanging up the parade.\nThe boys shout Get rid of those things, etc.\n91.\tEXTERIOR FIELD\nThe final shot is of the helicopter rising up . As it disappears, a shower of photos come from its window.\nWe cut to a CLOSE-UP of one signed photo as it hits the ground and SUPER the closing credits over it.", "Next number was called Sha La La La La La\n Youre joking!\n No?\n La?\n Ah, but, in fact, Baby Its You\n Why dont you do it in your famous James Mason impersonation voice?\n Ha, ha\n All right!

Were all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and its all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor the blimeys, heave the mo! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show\n \n This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because Love Me Do got into the top twenty, and we cant believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, Id like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which Im trying to forget, in October. Id like to reply personally to everyone, but I just havent enough pens. In the meantime:\nGarry Crimble to you\nGarry Mimble to you\nGetty Bable, dear Christmas\nHappy Birthday me too\n This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, were all dead pleased by the way youve treated us in 1963, and well try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, weve been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, weve gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing\n Yes! Yes! Oh yes!\n Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows cause its, you know, its great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...\n Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!\n ...to make new records, which is what weve been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, Im running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...\n Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!\n ...so Ill finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription\n Ja, das wird uns danke schon\nUnd denn gruss von even\nJa, denn gruss von even schon\nJa, das wird wunderschon, boy\nDanke schon\nJa, Ringo!\nHello, Ringo here\nAs you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups...\nMerry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted\nKing Wenceslas:\nWell, good King Wenceslas looked out \nOn the feast of Stephen \nWhen the snow was on the ground \nDeep and crisp and even \nHooray!\nThank you, Ringo!

The final studio date was a 24-hour marathon session to create the running order for the four sides of the album and the edits and cross-fades between the songs. The sessions mark an important turning point in their recording career because it was during this period that The Beatles first recorded on an eight-track tape machine.\nSince 1964, the group had used four-track for all their album albums by but 1966, they found their musical arrangements usually required more tracks than were available. The solution was the create extra ones by copying the first four tracks to a second blank tape and simultaneously mixing some of them together to leave free as many racks as were needed for addition overdubs. Bouncing Down was a time consuming process because the tracks that were being mixed together would form part of the final sound balance of the completed song so it was important to be satisfied with the mix before overdubbing commenced. With eight tracks now available, the problem was eliminated - until even more were needed.\nWork began on the album using four tracks and, while some songs could be confined to these, most had to be bounced down to a second, third, or even - as with Revolution 1 and Ob-LA-Di, Ob-La-Da - a fourth tape. The Beatles first experience of using an eight track recording at Abbey Road was during a session on 3rd September for While My Guitar Gently Weeps. As it had been started on four-track. the master was transferred to an eight-track machine to allow further overdubbing.\nHowever, While My Guitar Gently Weeps was re-recorded on eight-track from scratch two days later with a guest appearance by Eric Clapton. and completed on 6th September with several overdubs. Georges decision to ask a friend to play on his song was a significant one. Although The Beatles had previously used other musicians on their sessions, they had been from other areas of music such as classical, jazz or Indian music. For the first time, here was a star musician performing on an instrument already featured in the group.\nThe albums long sessions would often begin in the afternoon and continue until daybreak the next morning. There were also occastions when two songs were recorded at the same time in separate studios. In July, engineer Geoff Emerick left the sessions and did not work with the group again until nearly a year later the Abbey Road. Ken Scott, who has first sat at the mixing desk for some of the Magical Mystery Tour songs, recored and mixed two thirds of The White Album. For one week, George Matin relinquished his seat in the room so that he could take a holiday and, consequently, his 21-year old production assistant Chris Thomas supervised sessions.", "Oh!

The double-LP was issued on the fifth anniversary of the release of their second album With The Beatles - 22nd November, 1968.\nThe Beatles released 34 new tracks in 1968 - returning to the high level of productivity they had maintained from 1963 to 1965. The first music of the year came in March with the arrival of their seventeenth single Lady Madonna. Soon after it was recorded, the Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of mediation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and they enjoyed a prolific period of song writing at this remote location. They began recording these new songs at Abbey Road on 30th May and studio work occupied most of their time until the final session on 16th October. Two songs from this period were released as a single on 30th August, 1968 - Hey Jude and Revolution. It was the first Beatles record to be pressed with the Apple label and the Parlophone imprint was also replaced for the two LP discs comprising The Beatles.\nAny expectations of a cover to rival the vivid art work of Sgt. Pepper of Magical Mystery tour were immediately overturned. The outside of the sleeve was completely white was the only lettering consisting of The Beatles embossed on the front and also printed on the spine with the catalogue number. Early copies also had an individual number stamped on the front. However, in contrast to the minimalistic look, some generous inserts were slipped alongside the records. There were four glossy color photographs of the individual Beatles and a large fold out poster displaying a photo collage on one side and lyrics on the other.\nDespite being an expensive double album, The Beatles was a huge seller. It entered the UK chart at number one and remained there for a total of eight of the 22 weeks it was listed. In the USA, it topped the charts of nine weeks and stayed in the album chart for an initial run of 65 weeks. As with Sgt. Pepper, no singles were released from The White Album in the UK and USA during the sixties.\nAmid the sessions for The Beatles, the animated film Yellow Submarine was given its UK premier on 17th July. The soundtrack LP featured four new Beatles songs and was in the shops eight weeks after the release of The Beatles.", "Hey Jude, dont make it bad\nTake a sad song and make it better\nRemember to

Please, Please Me, With The Beatles, Hard Days Night. Thats three. Now...Beatles For Sale.\nThe young men themselves arent for sale. Money, noisy though it is, doesnt talk that loud. But you can buy this album - you probably have, unless youre just browsing, in which case dont leave any dirty fingerprints on the sleeve!\nIt isnt all currency or current though. Theres priceless history between the covers. None of us is getting any younger. When, in a generation or so, a radio-active, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn, asks you what The Beatles affair was all about - ;Did you actually know them?- dont try to explain all about the long hair and the screams! Just play the child a few tracks from this album and hell probably understand what it is all about. The kids of AD 2000 will draw from this music much the sam sense of well being and warmth we do today.\nFor the magic of The Beatles is, I suspect, timeless and ageless. It has broken all frontiers and barriers. It has cut through differences of race, age, and class. It is adored by the world.\nThis album has some lovely samples of Beatles music. It has, for instance, eight new titles wrought by the incomparable John Lennon and Paul Mccartney, and mingling with the new, there are six numbers culled from the rhythmic wealth of the past extraordinary decade; pieces like Kansas City, and Rock and Roll Music. Marvelous.\nMany hours and hard days nights of devoted industry went into the production of this album. It isnt a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture.\nAt least three of the Lennon-Mccartney songs were seriously considered as single releases until John popped up with I Feel Fine. These three were Eight Days A Week, No Reply and Im A Loser. Each would have topped the charts, but as it is they are an adornment to this LP, and a lesson to other artists. As on other albums, The Beatles have tossed in far more value than the market usually demands.\nThere are few gimmicks or recording tricks, though for effect, The Beatles and their recording manager George Martin have slipped in some novelties. Like Paul on Hammond organ to introduce drama into Mr. Moonlight, which also, and for the first time, has George Harrison applying a thump to an elderly African drum because Ringo was busy elsewhere in the studio, playing bongos. Georges thump remains on the track. The bongos were later dropped. Ringo plays timpani in Every Little Thing, and on the Rock and Roll Music track George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano. On Words of Love, Ringo plays a packing case.\nBeyond this, it is a straightforward 1964 disc-making. Quite the best of its kind in the world. There is little or nothing on the album that cannot be reproduced on stage, which is, as students and critics of pop-music know, not always the case.\nHere it is then. The best album yet-quite definitely, says John, Paul, George, and Ringo-full of everything which made the four the biggest attraction the world has ever known. Full of raw John and Melodic Paul; a number from George, and a bonus from Ringo. For those who like to know who does exactly what, there are details alongside each title.", "Here I stand, head in hand\nTurn my face to the wall\nIf shes gone I cant go on\nFeeling two foot

Why dont we begin by…\nJohn: Doing Hamlet. \nRingo: Yeah, yeah, lets do that.\nPlayboy: That sounds like fun, but just for laughs, why dont we do an interview instead?\nGeorge: Say, thats a fine idea. I wish Id thought of that.\nPaul: What shall we ask you for a first question?\nRingo: About those Bunny girls…\nPlayboy: No comment. Lets start over. Ringo, youre the last Beatle to join the group, arent you?\nRingo: Yes.\nPlayboy: How long were you fellows working together as a team before Ringo joined up?\nJohn: A few years probably, sort of off and on, really, for three years or so.\nPaul: Yeah, but really amateur.\nGeorge: The local pub, you know. And in each others uncles houses.\nJohn: And at Georges brothers wedding. Things like that. Ringo used to fill in sometimes for our drummer.\nPlayboy: When you joined the others, Ringo, they werent quite as big as they are now, were they?\nRingo: They were the biggest thing in Liverpool. In them days that was big enough.\nPaul: This is a point weve made before. Some people say a man is made of muscle and blood…\nNo, they dont. They say, How come youve suddenly been able to adjust to fame, you know, to nationwide fame and things? It all started quite nicely with us, you see, in our own sphere, where we used to play—in Liverpool. We never used to play outside it, except when we went to Hamburg. Just those two circles. And in each of them, I think we were round the highest paid, and probably at the time the most popular. So in actual fact we had the same feeling of being famous then as we do now.\nGeorge: We were recognized then, too, only people didnt chase us about.\nPaul: But it just grew. The quantity grew, not the quality of the feeling.\nPlayboy: When did you know that you had really hit it big? There must have been one night when you knew it had really begun.\nJohn: Well, wed been playing round in Liverpool for a bit without getting anywhere, trying to get work, and the other groups kept telling us, Youll do all right, youll get work someday. And then we went to Hamburg, and when we came back, suddenly we were a wow. Mind you, 70 percent of the audience thought we were a German wow, but we didnt care about that.\nPaul: We were billed in the paper: From Hamburg—The Beatles.\nJohn: In Liverpool, people didnt even know we were from Liverpool. They thought we were from Hamburg. They said, Christ, they speak good English! Which we did, of course, being English. But thats when we first, you know, stood there being cheered for the first time.\nPaul: That was when we felt we were…\nJohn: …on the way up…\nPaul: …gonna make it in Liverpool.\nPlayboy: How much were you earning then?\nJohn: For that particular night, 20 dollars.\nPlayboy: Apiece?\nJohn: For the group! Hell, we used to work for a lot less than that.\nPaul: We used to work for about three or four dollars a night.\nRingo: Plus all the Coke we could drink. And we drank a lot.\nPlayboy: Do you remember the first journalist who came to see you and said, I want to write about you?\nRingo: We went round to them at first, didnt we?\nJohn: We went and said, Were a group and weve got this record out. Will you…\nGeorge: And then the door would slam.\nPlayboy: Weve heard it said that when you first went to America you were doubtful that youd make it over there.\nJohn: Thats true. We didnt think we were going to make it at all. It was only Brian telling us we were gonna make it. And George. Brian Epstein, our manager, and George Harrison.\nGeorge: I knew we had a good chance—because of the record sales over there.\nJohn: The thing is, in America it just seemed ridiculous—I mean, the idea of having a hit record over there. It was just, you know, something you could never do. Thats what I thought, anyhow. But then I realized that its just the same as here, that kids everywhere all go for the same stuff. And seeing wed clone it in England and all, theres no reason why we couldnt do it in America, too. But the American disc jockeys didnt know about British records; they didnt play them; nobody promoted them, and so you didnt have hits.\nGeorge: Well, there were one or two doing it as a novelty.\nJohn: But it wasnt until Time and Life and Newsweek came over and wrote articles and created an interest in us that the disc jockeys started playing our records. And Capitol said, Well, can we have their records? You know, they had been offered our records years ago, and they didnt want them. But when they heard we were big over here they said, Can we have em now? So we said, As long as you promote them. So Capitol promoted, and with them and all these articles on us, the records just took off.\nPlayboy: Theres been some dispute, among your fans and critics, about whether youre primarily entertainers or musicians—or perhaps neither. Whats your own opinion?\nJohn: Were money-makers first; then were entertainers.\nRingo: No, were not.\nJohn: What are we, then?\nRingo: Dunno. Entertainers first.\nJohn: OK.\nRingo: Cause we were entertainers before we were money-makers.\nJohn: Thats right, of course. Its just that the press drivels it into you, so you say it cause they like to hear it, you know?\nPaul: Still, wed be idiots to say that it isnt a constant inspiration to be making a lot of money. It always is, to anyone. I mean, why do big business tycoons stay big business tycoons? Its not because theyre inspired at the greatness of big business; theyre in it because theyre making money at it. Wed be idiots if we pretended we were in it solely for kicks. In the beginning we were, but at the same time, we were hoping to make a bit of cash. Its a switch around now, though, from what it used to be. We used to be doing it mainly for kicks and not making a lot of money, and now were making money without too many kicks—except that we happen to like the money were making. But we still enjoy making records, going onstage, making films, and all that business.\nJohn: We love every minute of it, Beatle people!\nPlayboy: As hard-bitten refugees from the Liverpool slums—according to heartrending fan magazine biographies—do you feel prepared to cope with all this sudden wealth?\nPaul: Weve managed to make the adjustment. Contrary to rumor, you see, none of us was brought up in any slums or in great degrees of poverty. Weve always had enough; weve never been starving.\nJohn: Yeah, we saw these articles in the American fan mags that Those boys struggled up from the slums…\nGeorge: We never starved. Even Ringo hasnt.\nRingo: Even I.\nPlayboy: What kind of families do you come from?\nGeorge: Well, you know, not rich. Just workin class. Theyve got jobs. Just work.\nPlayboy: What does your father do?\nGeorge: Well, he doesnt do anything now. He used to be a bus driver…\nJohn: In the Merchant Navy.\nPlayboy: Do you have any sisters or brothers, George?\nGeorge: Ive got two brothers.\nJohn: And no sisters to speak of.\nPlayboy: How about you, Paul?\nPaul: Ive got one brother, and a father who used to be a cotton salesman down in New Orleans, you know. Thats probably why I look a bit tanned. But seriously, folks, he occasionally had trouble paying bills—but it was never, you know, never, Go out and pick blackberries, son; were a bit short this week.\nPlayboy: How about you, John?\nJohn: Oh, just the same. I used to have an auntie. And I had a dad whom I couldnt quite find.\nRingo: John lived with the Mounties.\nJohn: Yeah, the Mounties. They fed me well. No starvation.\nPlayboy: How about your family, Ringo, old man?\nRingo: Just workin class. I was brought up with my mother and me grandparents. And then she married my stepfather when I was 13. All the time she was working. I never starved. I used to get most things.\nGeorge: Never starved?\nRingo: No, I never starved. She always fed me. I was an only child, so it wasnt amazing.\nPlayboy: Its quite fashionable in some circles in America to hate your parents. But none of you seem to.\nRingo: Were probably just as against the things our parents liked or stood for as they are in America. But we dont hate our parents for it.\nPlayboy: Its often exactly the opposite in America.\nPaul: Well, you know, a lot of Americans are unbalanced. I dont care what you say. No, really. A lot of them are quite normal, of course, but weve met many unbalanced ones. You know the type of person, like the political Whig.\nPlayboy: How do you mean?\nPaul: You know—the professional politician type; in authority sort of thing. Some of them are just mad! And Ive met some really maniac American girls! Like this girl who walked up to me in a press conference and said, Im Lily. I said, Hello, how do you do? and she said, Doesnt my name mean anything to you? I said, Ah, no… and I thought, Oh God, its one of these people that youve met and you should know. And so Derek, our press agent, who happened to be there at the time, hanging over my shoulder, giving me quotes, which happens at every press conference…\nGeorge: You better not say that.\nPaul: Oh yes, thats not true, Beatle people! But he was sort of hanging about, and he said, Well, did you ring, or did you write, or something? And she said, No. And he said, Well, how did you get in touch with Paul? How do you know him? And she said, Through God. Well, there was sort of a ghastly silence. I mean, we both sort of gulped and blushed. I said, Well, thats very nice, Lily. Thanks very much. I must be off now.\nPlayboy: There wasnt a big lightning bolt from the sky?\nPaul: No, there wasnt. But I talked to her afterward, and she said shed got a vision from God and God had said to her…\nJohn: Its been a hard days night. \nPaul: No, God had said, Listen, Lil, Paul is waiting for you; hes in love with you and he wants to marry you, so go down and meet him, and hell know you right away. Its very funny, you know. I was trying to persuade her that she didnt in actual fact have a vision from God, that it was…\nGeorge: It was probably somebody disguised as God.\nPaul: You wouldnt hardly ever meet somebody like that in England, but there seemed to me to be a lot like her in America.\nJohn: Well, there are a lot more people in America, so youve got a much bigger group to get nutters from.\nPlayboy: Speaking of nutters, do you ever wake up in the morning, look in the mirror and say, My God, Im a Beatle?\nPaul: No, not quite. \nJohn: Actually, we only do it in each others company. I know I never do it alone.\nRingo: We used to do it more. Wed get in the car, Id look over at John and say, Christ, look at you; youre a bloody phenomenon! and just laugh—cause it was only him, you know. And a few old friends of ours done it, from Liverpool. Id catch em looking at me, and Id say, Whats the matter with you? Its just daft, them just screaming and laughing, thinking Im one of them people.\nPlayboy: A Beatle?\nRingo: Yes.\nPaul: The thing makes me know weve made it is like tonight, when we slipped into a sweetshop. In the old days we could have just walked into a sweetshop and nobody would have noticed us. We would have just got our sweets and gone out. But tonight we just walked in—it took a couple of seconds—and the people just dropped their sweets. Before, you see, there would have been no reaction at all. Except possibly, Look at that fellow with the long hair. Doesnt he look daft? But nowadays theyre just amazed; they cant believe it. But actually were no different.\nPlayboy: The problem is that you dont seem to be like real people. Youre Beatles.\nPaul: I know. Its very funny, that.\nGeorge: Its all the publicity.\nPaul: Were taken in by it, too. Because we react exactly the same way to the stars we meet. When we meet people weve seen on the telly or in films, we still think, Wow!\nJohn: Its a good thing, because we still get just as tickled.\nPaul: The thing is that people, when they see you on TV and in magazines and up in a film, and hear you on the radio, they never expect to meet you, you know, even our fans. Their wish is to meet you, but in the back of their mind they never think theyre actually gonna meet us. And so, when they do meet us, they just dont believe it.\nPlayboy: Where do they find you—hiding in your hotel rooms?\nJohn: No, on the street, usually.\nPlayboy: You mean youre brave enough to venture out in the streets without a bodyguard?\nRingo: Sure.\nGeorge: Were always on the street. Staggering about.\nRingo: Floggin our bodies.\nGeorge: You catch John sleeping in the gutter occasionally.\nPlayboy: When people see you in the street, do you ever have any action?\nGeorge: Well, not really, because when youre walking about, you dont bump into groups of people, as a rule. People dont walk round in gangs, as a rule.\nPlayboy: Can you even go out shopping without getting mobbed by them, individually or collectively?\nJohn: We avoid that.\nPaul: The mountain comes to Mohammed.\nGeorge: The shop comes to us, as he says. But sometimes we just roll into a store and buy the stuff and leg out again.\nPlayboy: Isnt that like looking for trouble?\nPaul: No, we walk four times faster than the average person.\nPlayboy: Can you eat safely in restaurants?\nGeorge: Sure we can. I was there the other night.\nJohn: Where?\nGeorge: Restaurants.\nPaul: Of course were known in the restaurants we go in.\nGeorge: And usually its only Americans thatll bother you.\nPlayboy: Really?\nGeorge: Really. If we go into a restaurant in London, theres always going to be a couple of them eating there; you just tell the waiter to hold them off if they try to come over. If they come over anyway, you just sign.\nRingo: But you know, the restaurants I go to, probably if I wasnt famous, I wouldnt go to them. Even if I had the same money and wasnt famous I wouldnt go to them, because the people that go to them are drags. The good thing when you go to a place where the people are such drags, such snobs, you see, is that they wont bother to come over to your table. They pretend they dont even know who you are, and you get away with an easy night.\nGeorge: And they think theyre laughing at us, but really were laughing at them. Cause we know they know who we are.\nRingo: Hows that?\nGeorge: Theyre not going to be like the rest and ask for autographs.\nRingo: And if they do, we just swear at em.\nGeorge: Well, I dont, Beatle people. I sign the autograph and thank them profusely for coming over and offer them a piece of my chop.\nJohn: If were in the middle of a meal. I usually say, Do you mind waiting till Im finished?\nGeorge: And then we keep eating until they give up and leave.\nJohn: Thats not true, Beatle people!\nPlayboy: Apart from these occupational hazards, are you happy in your work? Do you really enjoy getting pelted by jelly beans and being drowned out by thousands of screaming subteenagers?\nRingo: Yes.\nGeorge: We still find it exciting.\nJohn: Well, you know…\nPaul: After a while, actually, you begin to get used to it, you know.\nPlayboy: Can you really get used to this?\nPaul: Well, you still get excited when you go onto a stage and the audience is great, you know. But obviously youre not as excited as you were when you first heard that one of your records had reached number one. I mean, you really do go wild with excitement then; you go out drinking and celebrating and things.\nRingo: Now we just go out drinkin anyway.\nPlayboy: Do you stick pretty much together offstage?\nJohn: Well, yes and no. Groups like this are normally not friends, you know; theyre just four people out there thrown together to make an act. There may be two of them who sort of go off and are friends, you know, but…\nGeorge: Just what do you mean by that?\nJohn: Strictly platonic, of course. But were all rather good friends, as it happens.\nPlayboy: Then you do see a good deal of one another when youre not working?\nPaul: Well, you know, it depends. We neednt always go to the same places together. In earlier days, of course, when we didnt know London, and we didnt know anybody in London, then we really did stick together, and it would really just be like four fellows down from the north for a coach trip. But nowadays, you know, weve got our own girlfriends—theyre in London—so that we each normally go out with our girlfriends on our days off. Except for John, of course, whos married.\nPlayboy: Do any of the rest of you have plans to settle down?\nPaul: I havent got any.\nGeorge: Ringo and I are gettin married.\nPlayboy: Oh? To whom?\nGeorge: To each other. But thats a thing you better keep a secret.\nRingo: You better not tell anybody.\nGeorge: I mean, if we said something like that, peopled probably think were queers. After all, thats not the sort of thing you can put in a reputable magazine like Playboy. And anyway, we dont want to start the rumor going.\nPlayboy: Wed better change the subject, then. Do you remember the other night when this girl came backstage…\nGeorge: Naked…\nPlayboy: Unfortunately not. And she said…\nGeorge: Its been a hard days night.\nPlayboy: No, she pointed at you, George, and said, Theres a Beatle! And you others said, Thats George. And she said, No, its a Beatle!\nJohn: And you said, This way to the bedroom.\nPlayboy: No, it was, Would you like us to introduce you to him?\nJohn: I like my line better.\nPlayboy: Well, the point is that she didnt believe that there was such a thing as an actual Beatle person.\nJohn: Shes right, you know.\nPlayboy: Do you run across many like her?\nGeorge: Is there any other kind?\nPlayboy: In America, too?\nRingo: Everywhere.\nPlayboy: With no exceptions?\nJohn: In America, you mean?\nPlayboy: Yes.\nJohn: A few.\nPaul: Yeah. Some of those American girls have been great.\nJohn: Like Joan Baez.\nPaul: Joan Baez is good, yeah, very good.\nJohn: Shes the only one I like.\nGeorge: And Jayne Mansfield, Playboy made her.\nPaul: Shes a bit different, isnt she? Different.\nRingo: Shes soft.\nGeorge: Soft and warm.\nPaul: Actually, shes a clot.\nRingo: Says Paul, the god of the Beatles.\nPaul: I didnt mean it, Beatle people! Actually, I havent even met her. But you wont print that anyway, of course, because Playboy is very pro-Mansfield. They think shes a rave. But she really is an old bag.\nPlayboy: By the way, what are Beatle people?\nJohn: Its something they use in the fan mags in America. They all start out, Hi there, Beatle people, spect youre wondering what the Fab Foursome are doing these days! Now we use it all the time, too.\nPaul: Its low-level journalese.\nJohn: But I mean, you know, theres nothing wrong with that. Its harmless.\nPlayboy: Speaking of low-level journalese, there was a comment in one of the London papers the other day that paralleled you guys with Hitler. Seriously! It said that you have the same technique of drawing cheers from the crowd…\nPaul: That power isnt so much us being like Hitler; its that the audiences and the show have got sort of, you know, a Hitler feel about them, because the audience will shout when theyre told to. Thats what that critic was talking about. Actually, that article was one which I really got annoyed about, cause shes never even met us.\nPlayboy: She?\nPaul: The woman who wrote it. Shes never met us, but she was dead against us. Like that Hitler bit. And she said we were very boring people. The Boresome Foursome, she called us. You know, really, this woman was really just shouting her mouth off about us—as people, I mean.\nRingo: Oh, come on.\nPaul: No, you come on. I rang up the newspaper, you know, but they wouldnt let me speak to her. In actual fact, they said, Well, Ill tell you, the reason we dont give her phone number out is because she never likes to speak to people on the phone because shes got a terrible stutter.\nSo I never did actually follow it up. Felt sorry for her. But I mean, the cheek of her, writing this damn article about us. And telling everybody how were starting riots, and how we were such bores—and shes never even met us, mind you! I mean, we could turn around and say the same about her! I could go and thump her!\nGeorge: Bastard fascist!\nPlayboy: Ringo…\nRingo: Yes, Playboy, sir?\nPlayboy: How do you feel about the press? Has your attitude changed in the last year or so?\nRingo: Yes.\nPlayboy: In what way?\nRingo: I hate em more now than I did before.\nPlayboy: Did you hear about the riot in Glasgow on the night of your last show there?\nJohn: We heard about it after.\nPlayboy: Did you know that the next day there was a letter in one of the Glasgow papers that accused you of directly inciting the violence?\nRingo: How can they say that about us? We dont even wiggle. Its not bloody fair.\nGeorge: Bastards!\nPaul: Glasgow is like Belfast. Therell probably be a bit of a skirmish there, too. But its not because of us. Its because people in certain cities just hate the cops more than in other cities.\nGeorge: Right.\nPaul: There were ridiculous riots last time we were there—but it wasnt riots for us. The crowd was there for us, but the riots after our show…\nRingo: All the drunks come out, out of the pubs.\nPaul: …It was just beatin up coppers.\nPlayboy: They just used the occasion as a pretext to get at the cops?\nGeorge: Yeah.\nPaul: In Dublin this trip, did you see where the crowd sort of stopped all the traffic? They even pulled a driver out of a bus.\nJohn: They also called out the fire brigade. We had four fire engines this time.\nPlayboy: People were also overturning cars and breaking shop windows. But all this had nothing to do with your show?\nPaul: Well, its vaguely related, I suppose. Its got something to do with it, inasmuch as the crowds happen to be there because of our show.\nJohn: But nobody whos got a bit of common sense would seriously think that 15-year-old girls are going round smashing shop windows on account of us.\nGeorge: Certainly not. Those girls are eight years old.\nPlayboy: This talk of violence leads to a related question. Do you guys think therell be another war soon?\nGeorge: Yeah. Friday.\nRingo: I hope not. Not just after weve got our money through the taxes.\nJohn: The trouble is, if they do start another war, then everybody goes with you.\nPlayboy: Do you think the Rolling Stones will be the first to go?\nPaul: It wont matter, cause well probably be in London or Liverpool at the time, and when they drop the bomb, itll be in the middle of the city. So we probably wont even know it when it happens.\nPlayboy: We brought this up for a reason, fellows. There was an essay not long ago in a very serious commentary magazine, saying that before every major war in this century, there has been a major wave of public hysteria over certain specific entertainers. There was the Irene Castle craze before World War One…\nPaul: Oh, yes.\nGeorge: I remember that well.\nPlayboy: And then; before World War Two, there was the swing craze, with Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw, and all the dancing in the aisles. And now you—before…\nJohn: Hold on! Its not our fault!\nPlayboy: Were not saying you may have anything to do with inciting a war…\nPaul: Thanks.\nPlayboy: But dont you think you may be a symptom of the times, part of an undercurrent thats building up?\nPaul: That sort of comparison just falls down when you look at it, really. Its just like saying that this morning a fly landed on my bed and that I looked at my watch and it was eight oclock, and that therefore every morning at eight oclock flies land on the bed. It doesnt prove anything just cause it happens a few times.\nPlayboy: Lets move on to another observation about you. Did you know that the Duke of Edinburgh was recently quoted as saying that he thought you were on your way out?\nJohn: Good luck, Duke.\nGeorge: No comment. See my manager.\nPaul: He didnt say it, though. There was a retraction, wasnt there?\nJohn: Yeah, we got a telegram. Wonderful news.\nPaul: We sent one back. Addressed to Liz and Phil.\nPlayboy: Have you ever met the Queen?\nJohn: No, shes the only one we havent met. Weve met all the others.\nPaul: All the mainstays.\nPlayboy: Winston Churchill?\nRingo: No, not him.\nJohn: Hes a good lad, though.\nPlayboy: Would you like to meet him?\nGeorge: Not really. Not more than anybody else.\nPaul: I dunno. Somebody like that you wish you could have met when he was really at his peak, you know, and sort of doing things and being great. But there wouldnt be a lot of point now, because hes sort of gone into retirement and doesnt do a lot of things anymore.\nPlayboy: Is there any celebrity you would like to meet?\nPaul: I wouldnt mind meeting Adolf Hitler.\nGeorge: You could have every room in your house papered.\nPlayboy: Would you like to meet Princess Margaret?\nPaul: We have.\nPlayboy: How do you like her?\nRingo: OK. And Philips OK, too.\nPlayboy: Even after what he supposedly said about you?\nRingo: I dont care what he said; I still think hes OK. He didnt say nothing about me personally.\nPaul: Even if he had said things about us, it doesnt make him worse, you know.\nPlayboy: Speaking of royalty…\nPaul: Royalty never condemns anything unless its something that they know everybody else condemns.\nRingo: If I was royal…\nPaul: If I was royal I would crack long jokes and get a mighty laugh. If I was royal.\nGeorge: What would we do with Buckingham Palace? Royaltys stupid.\nPlayboy: You guys seem to be pretty irreverent characters. Are any of you churchgoers?\nJohn: No.\nGeorge: No.\nPaul: Not particularly. But were not antireligious. We probably seem to be antireligious because of the fact that none of us believe in God.\nJohn: If you say you dont believe in God, everybody assumes youre antireligious, and you probably think thats what we mean by that. Were not quite sure what we are, but I know that were more agnostic than atheistic.\nPlayboy: Are you speaking for the group or just for yourself?\nJohn: For the group.\nGeorge: Johns our official religious spokesman.\nPaul: We all feel roughly the same. Were all agnostics.\nJohn: Most people are, anyway.\nRingo: Its better to admit it than to be a hypocrite.\nJohn: The only thing weve got against religion is the hypocritical side of it, which I cant stand. Like the clergy is always moaning about people being poor, while they themselves are all going around with millions of quid worth of robes on. Thats the stuff I cant stand.\nPaul: A new bronze door stuck on the Vatican.\nRingo: Must have cost a mighty penny.\nPaul: But believe it or not, were not anti-Christ.\nRingo: Just anti-Pope and anti-Christian.\nPaul: But you know, in America…\nGeorge: They were more shocked by us saying we were agnostics.\nJohn: They went potty; they couldnt take it. Same as in Australia, where they couldnt stand us not liking sports.\nPaul: In America theyre fanatical about God. I know somebody over there who said he was an atheist. The papers nearly refused to print it because it was such shocking news that somebody could actually be an atheist. Yeah, and admit it.\nRingo: He speaks for all of us.\nPlayboy: To bring up another topic thats shocking to some, how do you feel about the homosexual problem?\nGeorge: Oh yeah, well, were all homosexuals, too.\nRingo: Yeah, were all queer.\nPaul: But dont tell anyone.\nPlayboy: Seriously, is there more homosexuality in England than elsewhere?\nJohn: Are you saying theres more over here than in America?\nPlayboy: Were just asking.\nGeorge: Its just that theyve got crewcuts in America. You cant spot em.\nPaul: Theres probably a million more queers in America than in England. England may have its scandals—like Profumo and all—but at least theyre heterosexual.\nJohn: Still, we do have more than our share of queers, dont you think?\nPaul: It just seems that way because theres more printed about them over here.\nRingo: If they find out that somebody is a bit bent, the press will always splash it about.\nPaul: Right. Take Profumo, for example. Hes just an ordinary…\nRingo: Sex maniac.\nPaul: …just an ordinary fellow who sleeps with women. Yet its adultery in the eyes of the law, and its an international incident. But in actual fact, if you check up on the statistics, you find that there are hardly any married men whove been completely faithful to their wives.\nJohn: I have! Listen, Beatle people…\nPaul: All right, we all know Johns spotless. But when a thing like that gets into the newspapers, everybody goes very, very Puritan, and they pretend that they dont know what sex is about.\nGeorge: They get so bloody virtuous all of a sudden.\nPaul: Yes, and some poor heel has got to take the brunt of the whole thing. But in actual fact, if you ask the average Briton what they really think of the Profumo case, theyd probably say, He was knockin off some bird. So what?\nPlayboy: Incidentally, youve met Mandy Rice-Davies, havent you?\nGeorge: What are you looking at me for?\nPlayboy: Because we hear she was looking at you.\nJohn: We did meet Christine Keeler.\nRingo: Ill tell you who I met. I met whats-her-name—April Ashley.\nJohn: I met her, too, the other night.\nPlayboy: Isnt she the one who used to be a man, changed her sex and married into the nobility?\nJohn: Thats the one.\nRingo: She swears at me, you know. But when she sobers up she apologizes.\nJohn: Actually, I quite like her. Him. It. That.\nPaul: The trouble with saying something like, Profumo was just a victim of circumstances or April Ashley isnt so bad, even though shes changed sex—saying things like that in print to most people seems so shocking; whereas in actual fact, if you really think about it, it isnt. Just saying a thing like that sounds much more shocking than it is.\nRingo: I got up in the Ad Lib the other night and a big handbag hit me in the gut. I thought it was somebody I knew; I didnt have any glasses on. I said, Hello, and a bloody big worker Arrgghhh. So I just ran into the bog. Because Id heard about things like that.\nPlayboy: What are you talking about?\nGeorge: He doesnt know.\nPlayboy: Do you?\nGeorge: Havent the slightest.\nPlayboy: Can you give us a hint, Ringo? Whats the Ad Lib, for example?\nRingo: Its a club.\nGeorge: Like your Peppermint Lounge, and the Whisky à GoGo. Its the same thing.\nPaul: No, the English version is a little different.\nJohn: The Whisky à GoGo is exactly the same, isnt it, only they have someone dancing on the ceiling, dont they?\nGeorge: Dont be ridiculous. They have two girls dancing on the roof; and in the Ad Lib they have a colored chap. Thats the difference.\nPlayboy: We heard a rumor that one of you was thinking of opening a club.\nJohn: I wonder who it was, Ringo.\nRingo: I dont know, John. There was a rumor, yes. I heard that one, too.\nPlayboy: Is there any truth to it?\nRingo: Well, yes. We was going to open one in Hollywood, but it fell through.\nJohn: Dino wouldnt let you take the place over.\nRingo: No.\nPaul: And we decided its not worth it. So we decided to sit tight for six months and then buy…\nGeorge: America.\nPlayboy: Have you heard about the Playboy Club thats opening in London?\nRingo: Yes, Ive heard about it.\nPlayboy: What do you think of our Clubs?\nRingo: Theyre for dirty old men, not for the likes of us—dirty young men. Theyre for businessmen that sneak out without their wives knowing, or if their wives sneak out first, for those who go out openly.\nGeorge: Theres no real fun in a Bunnys fluffy tail.\nPlayboy: Then you dont think a Club will make it here?\nGeorge: Oh yes, course it will.\nRingo: Theres enough dirty old men here.\nPlayboy: Have you ever read the magazine?\nJohn: Yes.\nGeorge: Yes.\nRingo: I get my copy every month. Tits.\nPlayboy: Do you read the Philosophy, any of you?\nPaul: Some of it. When the journeys really long and you cant last out the pictures, you start reading it. Its OK.\nPlayboy: How about Playboys Jazz Poll? Do you read it, too?\nJohn: Occasionally.\nPlayboy: Do you enjoy jazz, any of you?\nGeorge: What kind?\nPlayboy: American jazz.\nJohn: Who, for example?\nPlayboy: You tell us.\nPaul: We only dig those who dig us.\nPlayboy: Seriously, who? Anyone?\nJohn: Getz. But only because somebody gave me an album of his. With him and somebody called Iguana, or something like that.\nPlayboy: You mean João Gilberto?\nJohn: I dont know. Some Mexican.\nPlayboy: Hes Brazilian.\nJohn: Oh.\nPlayboy: Are you guys getting tired of talking?\nJohn: No.\nPaul: No, lets order some drinks. Scotch or Coke?\nJohn: Ill have chocolate.\nGeorge: Scotch for me and Paul and chocolate for the Beatle teenager.\nJohn: Scotch is bad for your kidneys.\nPaul: How about you, Ringo? Dont you want something to keep you awake while youre listening to all this rubbish?\nRingo: Ill have a Coke.\nJohn: How about you, Playboy, are you man or woman?\nPaul: Its a Beatle people!\nGeorge: Whos your fave rave?\nPaul: I love you!\nGeorge: How gear.\nPlayboy: Speaking of fave raves, why do you think the rock-n-roll phenomenon is bigger in England than in America?\nJohn: Is it?\nPaul: Yes. You see, in England, after us, you have thousands of groups coming out everywhere, but in America theyve just sort of had the same groups going for ages. Some have made it and some havent, but there arent really any new ones. If wed been over there instead of over here, there probably would have been the same upsurge over there. Our road manager made an interesting point the other day about this difference in America. In America the people who are the big stars are not our age. Theres nobody whos a really big star around our age. Possibly it may seem like a small point, but theres no conscription—no draft—here. In America we used to hear about somebody like Elvis, who was a very big star and then suddenly he was off in the Army.\nJohn: And the Everly Brothers.\nPaul: Yes, the Everly Brothers as well went into the Army at the height of their fame. And the Army seems to do something to singers. It may make them think that what theyre playing is stupid and childish. Or it may make them want to change their style, and consequently they may not be as popular when they come out of the Army. It may also make people forget them, and consequently they may have a harder job getting back on top when they get out. But here, of course, we dont have that problem.\nJohn: Except those who go to prison.\nPaul: Its become so easy to form a group nowadays, and to make a record, that hundreds are doing it—and making a good living at it. Whereas when we started, it took us a couple of years before the record companies would even listen to us, never mind give us a contract. But now, you just walk in and if they think youre OK, youre on.\nPlayboy: Do you think you had anything to do with bringing all this about?\nJohn: Its a damn fact.\nPaul: Not only us. Us and people who followed us. But we were the first really to get national coverage because of some big shows that we did, and because of a lot of public interest in us.\nPlayboy: What do you think is the most important element of your success—the personal appearances or the records?\nJohn: Records. Records always have been the main thing. P.A.s follow records. Our first records were made, and then we appeared.\nPlayboy: Followed closely by Beatle dolls. Have you seen them?\nGeorge: Theyre actually life size, you know.\nPlayboy: The ones weve seen are only about five inches high.\nPaul: Well, were midgets, you see.\nPlayboy: How does it make you feel to have millions of effigies of yourselves decorating bedsides all over the world? Dont you feel honored to have been immortalized in plastic? After all, theres no such thing as a Frank Sinatra doll or an Elvis Presley doll.\nGeorge: Whod want an ugly old crap doll like that?\nPlayboy: Would you prefer a George doll, George?\nGeorge: No, but Ive got a Ringo doll at home.\nPlayboy: Did you know that youre probably the first public figures to have dolls made of them—except maybe Yogi Berra?\nJohn: In Jellystone Park. Do you mean the cartoon?\nPlayboy: No. Didnt you know that the cartoon character is based on a real person—Yogi Berra, the baseball player?\nGeorge: Oh.\nPlayboy: Didnt you know that?\nJohn: I didnt know that.\nPaul: Well, theyre making us into a cartoon, too, in the States. Its a series.\nJohn: The highest achievement you could ever get.\nPaul: We feel proud and humble.\nPlayboy: Did you know, George, that at the corner of 47th Street and Broadway in New York, there is a giant cutout of you on display?\nGeorge: Of me?\nPlayboy: Life size.\nRingo: Nude.\nPlayboy: No—but the reason we mention it is that this is really a signal honor. For years on that corner, theres been a big store with life-size cutouts of Marilyn Monroe, Anita Ekberg or Jayne Mansfield in the window.\nJohn: And now its George.\nPaul: The only difference is theyve got bigger tits.\nRingo: I suppose thats one way of putting it.\nGeorge: The partys getting rough. Im going to go to bed. You carry on, though; Ill just stop my ears with cotton—so as not to hear the insults and the smutty language.\nPlayboy: Weve just about run out of steam anyway.\nJohn: Do you have all you need?\nPlayboy: Enough. Many thanks, fellows.\nJohn: Course a lot of it you wont be able to use—crap and bloody and tit and bastard and all.\nPlayboy: Wait and see.\nRingo: Finish your Scotch before you go.\nJohn: You dont mind if I climb into bed, do you? Im frazzled.\nPlayboy: Not at all. Good night.\nRingo: Good night, Playboy.\nGeorge: Its been a hard days night.", "", "Hey Steve\nDon’t leave the game\nTake some oak logs and craft some planks\nRemember to never

But I think we’d all enjoy making a new film.\nRINGO: Yeah, it’s good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we’ve sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we’re not supposed to look at the camera, you’d always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it. You’d just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know.\nPAUL: And on this one, I don’t know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling.\nRINGO: Yeah.\nPAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know.

But I’m supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It’s all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I’m a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don’t know why, I must have thought I was a good actor! And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It’s all your fault!” Flapping my arms around, and he couldn’t stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit.\nRINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit.\nPAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something. \nRINGO: Yeah.\nPAUL: They cut some of it.\nRINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven’t printed or put on the film, but it’s great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up.", "I dig a pony\nWell, you can celebrate anything you want\nYes, you can celebrate anything you want\nOh\nI do a road hog\nWell, you can penetrate any place you go\nYes, you can penetrate any place you go\nI told you so\nAll I want is you\nEverything has got to be just like you want it to\nBecause\nI pick a moon dog\nWell, you can radiate everything you are\nYes, you can radiate everything you are\nOh now\nI roll a stoney\nWell, you can imitate everyone you know\nYes, you can imitate everyone you know\nI told you so\nAll I want is you\nEverything has got to be just like you want it to\nBecause \nOh now\nI feel the wind blow\nWell, you can indicate everything you see\nYes, you can indicate everything you see\nOh now\nI load a lorry\nWell, you can syndicate any boat you row\nYeah, you can syndicate any boat you row\nI told you so\nAll I want is you\nEverything has got to be just like you want it to\nBecause", "Gave you them whiskey eyes\nThose California dreaming nights\nI never thought we’d be this high\nWe’re dancing side by side\nAnd she drinking on the lime\nHer heart can lie tonight\nShe holding onto mine\nThe feelings won’t subside\nI don’t know why\nIt feels like, it feels like\nI dont know what to feel like\nBut I know that it feels right\nIt feels like, it feels like\nI dont know what to feel like\nBut I know that it feels right\nGave you them whiskey eyes\nThose California dreaming nights\nI never thought we’d be this high\nWe’re dancing side by side\nNow we drunk in love tonight\nStaring at the sky\nThe stars a passing by\nDon’t you let me try\nIf it’s just this one time\nIt feels like, it feels like\nI dont know what to feel like\nBut I know that it feels right\nIt feels like, it feels like\nI dont know what to feel like\nBut I know that it feels right", "Sha la la la la la la\nSha la la la la la la\nSha la la la la la la\nSha la la la la\nIts not the way you smile that touched my heart \nIts not the way you kiss that tears me apart\nUh-oh\nMany, many, many nights go by\nI sit alone at home and I cry over you\nWhat can I do?\nI cant help myself, cause baby its you\nBaby, its you\nYou should hear what they say about you: cheat, cheat\nThey say, they say you never never never ever been true \nUh-oh\nIt doesnt matter what they say\nI know Im gonna love you any old way\nWhat can I do?
