Next he plays “Happier When We’re Together,” a ballad in which he worries a girlfriend will be unfaithful while he’s on tour. Standing up as his own beatboxing merges seamlessly with a drum machine at the beginning of “You’re the One,” he does an impromptu variation of the Moonwalk\nOne can forgive him for the victory dance. Since his debut three years ago Bieber has sold 15 million albums, grossing $150 million on 157 tour dates across two dozen countries along the way. His biopic, Never Say Never, pulled in $30 million on its opening weekend, just shy of the ­concert-film record, and racked up $100 million at the box office in total. His fragrance, Someday, debuted last June and did $60 million in retail sales during its first six months on the market. Those income streams helped Bieber personally earn an estimated $55 million over the past 12 months and $108 million over the past two years\n“You have humans, and you have aliens,” says veteran hitmaker Timothy “Timbaland” Mosley, one of the producers on Believe. “I think he’s half-human and half-alien.”\nEven more impressive than Bieber’s earning power: his vast social media reach, part of the reason he ranks third on this year’s Celebrity 100 list. Bieber boasts 21 million Twitter followers—more than any person on Earth not named Lady Gaga. His 43 million Facebook fans are more than Mitt Romney’s and Barack Obama’s put together. With 740 million views, his breakout ballad, “Baby,” is the most-watched video in YouTube history; if you assume three minutes per song, his VEVO channel’s 2.4 billion impressions are enough to provide one minute of video to every person on the planet\nBieber’s influence and moneymaking talents are fairly well established. It’s far more surprising what he’s doing with that cash. He provides a hint in the dim octagonal recording studio, owned by Rodney Jerkins, who had a hand in many of Michael Jackson’s late-career hits and is now producing songs for Believe. His dancing done, Bieber quickly settles into a chair behind a keyboard. Inspiration has struck: He starts tapping out a fresh beat, as comfortable with the sophisticated equipment as a pop star a generation earlier would be strumming a rhythm guitar. “Can you loop that, what I did?” he asks the engineer at one point. Bieber eventually turns to me: “The tech aspect is just fun for me.”\nBieber’s tech savvy infuses more than his music—it’s also a core strategy for how the entertainer intends to translate all that fame and fast money into enduring riches. Instinctively, he embraces a Peter Lynch model of investing—“I’m not going to invest in something I don’t like; I have to believe in the product”—but rather than load up on buy-what-you-know value stocks, the singer has been quietly plowing millions into private tech startups. According to his manager, Bieber holds stakes in a dozen such companies. FORBES was able to verify four: messaging platform Tinychat, social-­curation app Stamped, gaming outfit Sojo Studios and, most critically, Spot­i­fy, the disruptive music service founded by Daniel Ek and backed by everyone from Sean Parker to Li Ka-shing\nBieber has come a long way in the finance department since I first broached the subject with him a bit over a year ago. “I have a business manager,” he told me at the 2011 Grammys. “That basically sums up the question.” Today that’s changed: “I do calls every week with my business manager and my lawyer,” he says. “Each week I’m learning something about my business and what I need to know for my career.”\nYet the core truth of last year’s statement remains. Bieber is still a cocky, jokey teenager who, rightfully, thinks he has the world by the short hairs. His eye for technology and trends ultimately determines the go or no-go—and some of the investments have come through his own contacts—but the guy actively scouting deals, whether venture capital investments or brand extensions, has a nickname worthy of a teen idol’s manager: Scott Braun, known to all as Scooter. “We’re always looking for the next thing,” he says. “If we’re coming in and putting his name to something, and his brand and likeness and his social media power, then we will try and figure out a proper compensation.”\nThe story of how Braun discovered Bieber four years ago became so immediately legendary that the latter is loath to go there. “You want me to tell you how I got started, bro?” complains Bieber, before relenting. “I really don’t want to.”\nBieber grew up in Stratford, Ont., a town of 30,000 two hours west of Toronto. His mother was 18 when she gave birth to her only child, and she raised him mostly by herself in state-subsidized housing. “Yellow shag carpets,” he remembers, “and we had mice.”\nHe quickly saturated those carpets with sound waves, teaching himself to play drums, trumpet, piano and guitar. At age 12 he earned second place in a local talent competition for his rendition of Ne-Yo’s “So Sick.” His mother posted videos of his performance on YouTube for friends who couldn’t make the show; soon she was regularly uploading videos of her son covering soul songs\nAround the same time, Braun was doubling as an Atlanta party promoter and a small-time music industry executive. When singer Akon asked him to research an unrelated YouTube sensation, Braun accidentally came across one of Bieber’s videos—a nine-figure misclick. Astonished by the youngster’s tone and range, Braun tracked down Bieber’s mother and offered to fly her and her son to Atlanta to sing for him and R&B crooner Usher\n“It was just crazy to me because I didn’t really think that it was possible,” Bieber says. “I lived in such a small town and things like that didn’t really happen.” Before Web 2.0 they probably never did. Yet there was Bieber, blowing away Braun and Usher in March 2008. The duo quickly signed him to their joint venture, Raymond Braun Media Group, and Braun became Bieber’s manager. By September they’d landed him a record deal with Universal Music Group’s Island Def Jam. His first single cracked the top 20 after its July 2009 release, and his debut EP, My World, catapulted him to mainstream fame that fall. In December President Obama invited him to sing at the White House, and he wowed a national audience with a per­for­mance on Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve\nThis cultural phenomenon, born of social media, took a modicum of fame and tossed it into the digital echo chamber. Bieber opened a Twitter account in June 2009 and by September had amassed 1 million followers. He was also an early adopter of Instagram, the photo-sharing service recently purchased by Facebook for $1 billion, and boasts 1.5 million followers there, more than any other user \n“It used to be there was a mystery to the artist,” says Bieber. “Now there’s, like, no mystery—the fans want the connection, they want to see you Instagramming at a coffee shop in the morning.”\nWith such social media dexterity Bieber has built himself a formidable platform. The 30-year-old Braun’s challenge: sustaining the phenomenon. In many ways Bieber and Braun are the most intriguing talent-manager combo since Elvis and Colonel Tom Parker. Both managers wielded the influence that comes from discovering their charges young, and both faced the challenge of moving them past the fickle market of hysterical, screaming teenage girls\nBut whereas Parker took any deal he could and up to 50% of the action to make sure his once-in-a-lifetime meal ticket turned into a decades-long feast, Braun is more judicious. His deal with Bieber is closer to the standard 15%; he thinks long-term success requires selectivity, not ubiquity, and aligning all deals with Bieber’s brand. “I don’t let him get involved in anything unless he likes it,” he says. Turning Bieber into the world’s most unconventional venture capitalist is simply a sophisticated manifestation of that philosophy", "All you gotta do is just be there\nPray for a miracle", "For all the times that you rained on my parade\nAnd all the clubs you get in using my name\nYou think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake\nYou think Im crying on my own, well I aint\nAnd I didnt wanna write a song\nCause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care\nI dont but, you still hit my phone up\nAnd baby Ill be movin on\nAnd I think you should be somethin\nI dont wanna hold back\nMaybe you should know that\nMy mama dont like you and she likes everyone\nAnd I never like to admit that I was wrong\nAnd Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on\nAnd now I know, Im better sleeping on my own\nCause if you like the way you look that much\nOh baby you should go and love yourself\nAnd if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin\nYou should go and love yourself\nMy mama dont like you and she likes everyone\nAnd I never like to admit that I was wrong\nAnd Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on\nAnd now I know, Im better sleeping on my own\nCause if you like the way you look that much\nOh baby you should go and love yourself\nAnd if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin\nYou should go and love yourself\nBut when you told me that you hated my friends\nThe only problem was with you and not them\nAnd every time you told me my opinion was wrong\nAnd tried to make me forget where I came from\nAnd I didnt wanna write a song\nCause I didnt want anyone thinking I still care\nI dont but, you still hit my phone up\nAnd baby Ill be movin on\nAnd I think you should be somethin\nI dont wanna hold back\nMaybe you should know that\nMy mama dont like you and she likes everyone\nAnd I never like to admit that I was wrong\nAnd Ive been so caught up in my job, didnt see whats going on\nAnd now I know, Im better sleeping on my own\nCause if you like the way you look that much\nOh baby you should go and love yourself\nAnd if you think that Im still holdin on to somethin\nYou should go and fuck yourself", "Ive been runnin’ through the jungle\nIve been runnin with the wolves to get to you, to get to you\nI’ve been down the darkest alleys\nSaw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you, to get to you\nI was wonderin bout your momma\nDid she get that job she wanted?\nSold that car that gave her problems?\nI m just curious bout her, honest\nI wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, that night\nLost in a feeling along with the stars in the sky\nSo Im wondering, can we still be friends?\nCan we still be friends?\nDoesnt have to end\nAnd if it ends, can we be friends?\nCan we be friends?\nCan we be friends?\nCan we be friends?\nIm holdin’ on, I’m paper thin\nThis loves a game, you always win\nAnd blindly I am followin\nBreak down these walls and come on in\nYou’ve been wonderin why Ive been callin\nLike I got ulterior motives\nI know we didn’t end this so good\nBut you know we had somethin so good, oh\nIve been runnin through the jungle\nIve been runnin with the wolves to get to you\nTo get to you\nIve been down the darkest alleys\nSaw the dark side of the moon to get to you, to get to you\nIve looked for love in every stranger\nDid too much to ease the anger all for you\nYeah, all for you\nAll to get to you\nOh, oh, oh, to get to you", "I gave you the key when the door wasnt open, just admit it\nSee, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it\nNow Im all alone and my joys turned to moping\nTell me, where are you now that I need you?

It was very bad, and it’s hard to say much about it. While making quite a few atrocious pieces of “music” as a younger child, there were a few songs that are now considered pop classics from his last album Purpose. I agree with this; while wildly overplayed, his hit single “Love Yourself” was quite a decent song to its core. There’s no questioning the fact that Justin Bieber is a horrible, horrible man, but I feel like if he pulled it together a little bit, he’d have the ability to whip up a genuinely good record. He hyped this record up recently before the release of its main single “Yummy”. He claimed he’d gone on a “spiritual journey” for the past five years in his hiatus of making music, and was ready to put out his best album yet; a truly great masterpiece. Though, as one may expect after hearing a single song from this burning pile of garbage, it is not at all a masterpiece. It has no charm, and could easily be considered his worst album yet. In my opinion, it certainly is. All of his older childhood albums had a certain feel to them of just this kid being stupid and used for his lack of musical ability, but his songs had a certain nostalgia to them. Or at least they do now. While that may seem like the album would sound bad, the albums did emerge as child-star classics. This album, though, is an overproduced, terribly-written piece of garbage, with not one, but ZERO good songs on the entire thing. I gave Selena Gomez’s latest album “Rare” a 1.5 out of 10 because “Lose You To Love Me” is a genuinely good song. Though, there isn’t one good song on this entire thing. If I had to choose a favorite track, it would be “E.T.A.”, because the guitar riff isn’t terrible, and the lyrics and vocals in general aren’t too annoying or aggravating. That being said, if I could, I’d say my least favorite tracks are EVERYTHING ELSE.", "", "Yeah you got that honey hon\nThat honey hon, that honey honey\nYeah you got that honey hon\nThat honey hon,

the circumstances are. Although time can heal many wounds, there are wounds so deep they last lifetime. This Reuniting Love Spell has been specifically designed to help those in need of restoring love, whether from a recent split or a difficult breakup of many years. And the results are long-lasting and extremely powerful\nThere is no reason to be afraid. My magical spell can bring you and your loved one together without creating or using any negative energies\nWhen should I use a Return Lost Lover Spell?\nIf your relationship is broken and you have lost your partner, the Return Lost Lover Spell can help bring that person back into your life\nAs sad as the circumstances may currently be for you, within the spiritual realm you will find hope and solutions to your problem. Even if you think right now that there is no way back and that love has died forever. This is very rarely the case, because most often only negative energies, blockages, accumulated negative feelings, external influences, and dissatisfaction overshadow the relationship. Especially in such cases, a Return Lost Lover Spell is highly beneficial, since all spiritual causes will be eliminated and the love will automatically be rekindled. https://www.worldlovespells.com/",
