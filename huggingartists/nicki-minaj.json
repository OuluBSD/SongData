I actually get in arguments because people say Nicki doesnt rep New York. I say What do you mean? She shouts it out all of the time.\nYall dont want me to rep yall. Yall dont hear when I rep yall cause yall be dick-riding everybody else.\nShe does have a point. Do you feel you get the proper love from New York?\nHell fucking no.\nAnd I never understood that because you ran the same circuits of all these other rappers. You did the DVDs. You did the mixtapes. You came up on mixtapes like every other underground rapper in New York.\nI was selling my mixtape out of my mutherfucking BMW out on Jamaica mutherfucking Avenue to Amadu and Hussaine and these niggas. Fuck you niggas! You niggas dont know the fucking half of what Ive fucking been through!\n_________________________________________________________________\nWell, Sir Isaac Newton said the law of energy is, Energy is not lost or destroyed, it is merely transferred from on party to the next. You got a miserable bitch on a blog who writes something negative about you, you read it, and now youre miserable.\nAbsolutely. Right. Absolutely.\nWhat you think about the blogs, Scaff Beezy?\nHonestly, the blogs could just suck my damn cock, balls, deepthroat, gag, and choke.\n_________________________________________________________________\nSo, Miss Nicki Minaj, what do you say to people that say youre trying to be something that youre not like Lady Gaga or Madonna and youre doing things for shock value?\nWell, I mean, I dont know. In a minute, if I fucking sit down and piss, theyre going to tell me I cant do that cause another bitch did it.\nStupid ass bitches! Yo, niggas just want to compare her to somebody.\nEverybody! If they ever see me sitting down and peeing, theyre gonna fucking stone me.\nTheyre gonna say, Youre trying to be like Baracks wife. Look at her, shes sitting down and peeing like that. You trying to be like Michelle.\nWhy you sitting down and peeing Nicki?\nWhy dont you stand up?\nThat happens to everybody, though.\nIt does.\nNo, Nicki gets it so hard -- pause! Hospital flow, need more gauze.\nI think when they dont understand something they gotta compare it to something to make themselves feel comfortable.\nAbsolutely, I always say that. For their minds to interpret it, they have to draw a comparison. And I always say, even though its very common, its just a more simple-minded approach as opposed to looking at every situation as if its the first time. It is what it is. But even she gets compared to Madonna, and its a never-ending cycle. But I rather you compare me to someone that is winning and thats won than compare me to...\nSomeone that is washed. Thats a natural emotion though... Its easy for a loser to be jealous of a winner. Thats just the way that it is.\nDo you ever look back at some of your performances and look at your costumes and your wigs and say, I did look like a damn fool?\nYes! Yes, I do. Yes, I do.\nDo you ever think that?\nSometimes. Every now and then. You know what I like about superstars? I like my superstars to be out there. Jump out the window! Be like Prince with your ass out. I may see it and say, Damn, she looks like a fool, but youre a superstar.\nThats how I want to see my superstars. I dont want to see my superstars regular.\n_________________________________________________________________\nI keep saying this: I went to school for theater. I took four years of my life and devoted it to theater.\nI did that because my passion was acting. When I started rapping, I felt like I couldnt really be myself. When I started winning, I started feeling that I can be myself. I can do my accents, I can do my voices, I can do my faces, I can do costumes.\nI can now bring me to who, you know, people see as Nicki Minaj. I can now really bring me into it. And I think thats where the confusion lies, is that people thought that when I first came out, that that was me in my entirety. But that wasnt. That was a small facet of who I was.\nBut, who you see now is just a more multi-faceted mixture of all the personalities that I have in me. I mean... and I think that if I was to not show that, then I wouldnt be doing justice to all the people that feel like I do. Cause for every person who doesnt understand it is, there is a person who feels like me, who feels like... sometimes I just break out in an English accent, you know, like, whats wrong with that?\nYou can! Why not?\n_________________________________________________________________\nDo you think that mixtape Nicki and pop Nicki can exist in the same space?\nThey already are. Theyre already existing together, and they are both winning.\nWho do you feel that you lean towards more?\nI cant choose. I cant pick. I feel like the world makes them two different people, but in my mind theyre the same person.\nThats what I keep saying... I grew up in New York my whole life. I would go to the block and hang out with my home girls on the weekend, and then Monday through Friday I was having a nine-to-five on Wall Street.\nWhen I was an office manager I wasnt having the same conversation in the office that I was having on the block, but I was still the same person. I was Onika. But I knew how to switch it up and have an intelligent conversation with one group of people, get a job, ace the interview, and then go home with my home girls and have fun.\nIt seems like youre very versatile. If its one thing that I would love for little girls to embrace from Nicki Minaj is the fact that she is versatile. She knows how to kick it in the streets and she knows how to kick it in the corporate setting.\nRight, because you cant do too much of either. You really cant.\nIts unfortunate that at times hip hop culture will tell you to lean only to one side, when that is detrimental for your future. Its detrimental for your growth. Its detrimental to your longevity.\nAt a certain point as a woman -- Im not talking about as a man because weve seen The Blueprint with Jay. Weve seen that you could come in the game and do 10, 12, 15 – still win and still be the king of hip hop. We have not seen that with a woman. So, show me the blueprint. Thats all I want you to do -- show me the blueprint.\nI think you are creating it. Because Queen Latifah doesnt exist in that space anymore. She went on to become an actress.\nAnd is someone who I tip my hat to because Queen Latifah looked at it and said, Okay, wait, hmm, I may not want to be 40 years old rapping. The hip hop fans may not want to hear me when Im 40 years old rapping. So Im going to move in a way so that every aspect of who I am can be seen. Queen Latifah does musicals, movies, voice-overs for cartoons -- is she a sellout or is she winning?\nShes winning!\nSo these other bitches that only did rap and now theyre washed, and theyre living in, you know, low income housing - is that winning? Just so that a nigga in the street can give me a fucking dap? The same niggas that didnt buy my album any fucking way, that downloaded the shit? Get the fuck out of here!\n_________________________________________________________________\nWhen its all said and done, are you going to want to have kids? Get married?\nOh my goodness, I have to! I have to! Yep. Im gonna get married and have kids. I love children. I am obsessed with children.\nAnd yeah, I believe in marriage, and I believe marriage is forever. So, thats the other thing...\nLook in my eyes, look in my eyes / Know that well always be forever / Moment in time, moment in time...\nSafaree... Safaree...\n_________________________________________________________________\nDo you have any regrets? Cause youve had a relatively short career. This is the second album, and hopefully we can ten more of these. But do you have any regrets in this short time that youve been Nicki Minaj?\nI think my only regret would be not enjoying every single moment when I could have.\nHow can the author of I wish I could enjoy this moment for life not be here trying to enjoy every moment?\nAbsolutely. And thats the thing. It kinda just comes so quickly.\nPause!\nAnd then all of a sudden its like, Wait a minute. I just did Super Bowl. I just did Super Bowl with Madonna. And before I go into the Super Bowl stage Im just stressing and worrying. And then when I come off its all done. And what I did I even enjoy about it?\nNot even that, you closed up the Grammys.\nBut thats why, cause shes doing the Super Bowl, and shes thinking about the Grammys.\nAnd then Im doing the Grammys, and Im thinking about the NBA all-star game. Thats the only thing.\nIve gotten to a very good place, though. All of my friends and mentors in the game have been reaching out to me trying to encourage me because for some strange reason they knew how frazzled I used to be. And every time I tell people, No, no, Im really good. Im really happy. Im really at a peaceful place. Its almost like they dont believe me. So I thought the other day, I must have really, really been worried a lot. Because people who know me very well are like, Are you sure youre ok? But I really am. Ive never been this happy. Im so proud of this album. Im proud of myself. And I will not allow anyone to scare me out of my true potential. Its a scare tactic.\n_________________________________________________________________\nWhat is Nicki Minajs purpose? Because from the outside looking in, I think youre a very blessed individual. Because you got two things going against you. Number one, youre a female. And the female hip hop division was not existent before you started popping. And then youre from New York. Theres a lot of rappers from New York that arent popping right now. So you got those two things going against you.\nBeing that you were able to break through that and be the big superstar that you are, its like, Shes obviously here for something. I think its a bigger purpose than maybe you even know. But what is Nicki Minajs purpose?\nI have to pray on that. I think that my purpose will eventually be related to some sort of movement for my younger fans, really... Ive always had this dream of having a Nicki Minaj YMCA type of thing. When I was young -- well, everybody knows my story -- we didnt have a lot. Free lunch was the thing, We can get free lunch. Oh, were going to free lunch. This is like dope! So I remember those moments and I always play them back in my head. And I wish to think to myself, I wish there was a place we could also go to to go swimming and to do this and to do that.\nBut things were moving so quickly. My parents were so, not really stable and just -- my father being an addict and all that. In a lot of ways I feel like I didnt really have a childhood. So when I see kids, it melts my heart because Im looking at them and Im like Theyll never get this moment back again, and theyll always remember this time. How do we as adults optimize it for them right now, whether they have money or not.\nI think that one day I would like to do something for them, for kids in the inner cities, for them to have a place where they can go to and have not only recreation but schooling, tutoring. I remember I was really really smart in school, and I think my mother took that for granted. So she wouldnt really sit with me and take the extra time to give me that extra push. But I think that kids need that.\nIts weird because people would never expect me to be so into childrens education, but thats real shit. I dont just say that because it sounds good. I really am interested in learning how to build the education system to a point where we have more of a success rate in terms of black children that go from high school to college.\nI feel like college was not something that was engraved in my brain. I dont feel like that ever happened. Most of my closest girlfriends, it was just like once they got out of high school they figured, Oh well, were good now, were out of high school, or I got my GED, Im good. And I dont want my fans to think like that.\nI have such a great rapport with my fans. When they see me, they really be bringing out their Bachelors and their Masters saying, Look, Nicki, Look. Because they know how important it is to me. Its OK to have fun , but I also want you to realize that its for a time.\nOne day, youre going to look back and think Wait a minute, did I really lose my life clubbing and miss out on a moment where I couldve been building myself as a woman and having something to offer my children?\nWe got so many girls right now having children and dont even know the first thing to say to a child. But youre having a child because I want to keep this dude or it just happened. I want to get us to the place where it doesnt just happen and that were smarter than that. Were the ones in control again. Why are we never in control?\nWhy are we stuck with a baby? Why are we always stuck on the welfare line? Why are we always stuck having to beg, borrow, and steal to provide for our children? Why do we think its something wrong for waiting to have a baby? Waiting until youre 35 or 36 to have children?\nTechnology has changed – you can wait! Have something to offer them. Thats something thats dear to my heart, doing something that makes children feel like I dont have to rush to grow up. I can enjoy my childhood. I can have somewhere to go for free for recreational purposes and for schooling purposes. Thats my bigger goal in life.\nHow do you stay humble? I know you keep a tight circle, you keep guys like Scaff Beezy around.\nIm gonna ask Scaff. How do you keep her humble, Scaff Beezy? Do you ever see her getting a little bit extra...?\nYou wanna know whats crazy? Yesterday, remember I was saying to you, Its so crazy. Shes so famous. If she goes out, anytime we go somewhere, its such a freaking chaotic zoo movie.\nThe other day we went to a carnival. We thought wed be able to be in there, and just go on some rides, and nobody will notice anything. Within like seven minutes the whole park -- it was 10, 15 minutes until we got out.\nShe really hasnt changed. She really dont act like, Im this person or, Im that person. She just be there looking so oblivious to whats going on. Sometimes she doesnt even know shes famous like that. It doesnt faze her. She really hasnt changed a bit.\n_________________________________________________________________\nPay attention to that. How did you escape being more than just an ass?\nWe said that the other day, before I was just a rapping butt.\nA butt with lyrics\nHow did you get out of that?\nBecause I created a brand.\nPeople take for granted how hard it is so shout out to every woman and man thats won. Its very hard, mentally, this shit is draining and draining. For you to be able to get up there and do music that people love, and do interviews with a smile on your face, and act like this shit aint getting to you, its draining.\nIts crazy! Thats why so many artists go on drugs or become alcoholics. When I was coming up, I never understood it. I use to be like, What? They are so ungrateful. Why are they on drugs? Why dont they fucking appreciate their success? I would kill to be where they are, until you get here and you are like, Oh my god! Lord, is this the price I have to pay if I really want this? And hes like, Yep. Now lets see who really want it. But, I think I became more than that because people cannot deny... at the end of the day, people cant deny that...\nYou the shit. Say it! You dont have to be humble. Be like Ray J. Im tired of being humble.\nIm not a cocky person by nature.\nScaff, be cocky for her!\nYeah, yeah, yeah, man. You bitches aint shit, man. You need to just really -- When you see her, get the rose petals, just like shes said before, throw it out in front of her feet. You pour out the champagne. You feed her grapes. If something needs to be sucked, you suck it!\nWhat!? What would need to be sucked? On you?\nAy. Anything. Anywhere. Im in these streets looking for work. Were all in these streets, were looking for that work, that twerk.\n_________________________________________________________________\nI just want to tell you, Nicki, I think that youre very necessary. I think you represent something way bigger than hip hop. I think that youre gonna take hip hop to new levels. And I think, like how Jay-Z took it to heights and made people be like, Damn, hip hop can take you this far!? I think youre taking that baton and youre gonna take it even further.

She is no Jay Z. That is disrespectful to his legacy.”\nThis made me sit back and think because I never felt like she was disrespecting a legacy. I thought she was only creating hers, all the while paying homage to someone she looks up to.\nA blueprint by definition is a design plan or other technical drawing. Jay Z’s success story is Hip-Hop’s go-to plan or blueprint for success in the music business. Do the girls not need their own plan for success stories in this misogynistic game we call Hip-Hop? Does Nicki’s name on Forbes Hip Hop Cash Kings list mean nothing in terms of success?\nI think people, like the guys , I see saying this are missing the point and reading into the situation completely wrong. Theyre still stuck in the past wanting that “old Hip Hop” sound . Some believe Nicki is comparing herself to Jay Z from a lyrical standpoint.\nNo matter how you feel about Nickis lyrical capabilities, I dont think her album title decision meant her album would be like The Blueprint sonically at all, more conceptually speaking. I believe she meant that she’s showing female rappers what has to be done to win in this NEW day and age of Hip Hop/Rap music—what Jay Z showcased when he did The Blueprint.\nEven in spite of Nicki naming her album The Pinkprint, why would you expect Nicki to drop a Blueprint album anyway, sonically speaking, when Jay Z doesnt even make “Blueprint” type of music anymore? It makes no sense.\nThe game plan for female rappers has to be different than the boys’. That’s a proven FACT. Females who tried to be successful and aqcuire longevity as a rapper following the guys’ game plan, where are they now? No one truly cares enough to know. Women like Lauryn Hill, Queen Latifah, and Missy made their own rules, just like Nicki is doing now.\nNicki is both singing and rapping on tracks like Lauryn and Queen Latifah did. Nicki is furthering her acting career like Lauryn Hill and Queen Latifah did. Nicki is blatantly unapologetic for her oddness like Missy was. All the while, Nicki is successfully establishing herself as a mogul with tons of business ventures like Queen Latifah still is. Could this be the key to femcee longevity? Well see.\nTo continue, as said by radio personality, Peter Rosenberg and many others, Nicki is the most influential female rapper ever in terms of global reach and sales. Whether you like Nicki Minaj’s music and choices or not she has the updated game plan for the success of a female rapper in her possession. We know this because she is both creating it and winning. Through her triumphs and tribulations, Nicki teaches the upcoming females what should or should not be done. However, when speaking about Nicki’s moves it should be what can be done. She’s a mogul who has knocked down the doors the music industry tried to henge shut, for a second time, after the downfall of female rappers prior to Nicki. The Pinkprint will be another statement of all this and more.\nAdditional Thoughts\n    ADDED: 11.3.14\nAfter the release of The Pinkprints deluxe edition album cover, I began to have further thoughts about Nickis whole concept. Though I still stand behind the above stated points.\nSince fingerprints are unique per individual, what if the fingerprint on the cover represents Nicki, herself, being the pinkprint? What if shes telling people that she is the guideline to success as a female rapper? That is certainly a bold statement from the humble rapper. Nevertheless, her theory has not been proven wrong.\n    ADDED: 11.7.14\nV Magazine released an interview with Nicki Minaj today. Nicki explained to Patrik Sandberg how she wants people to have a glimpse of her life after hearing The Pinkprint.\nWhen I play this album for people, no matter how emotional or how hard the record is, it seems like it makes people excited, its a conversational piece, and they feel like theyre looking through a peephole at my life.\nMaybe The Pinkprint deluxe edition album cover wasnt created to allude to Nicki being the pinkprint. Instead, the fingerprint could be reinstating the albums more personal content\n    ADDED: 12.4.14\nIn the December 2014/January 2015 issue of Complex Magazine Nicki was interviewed by Lauren Nostro, who recalled her sit down with Nicki in an article called The Real Her.\nLN: Jay Z’s The Blueprint inspired the title The Pinkprint and the idea of laying the blueprint for female rappers to come. What similarities do you see between you right now and Jay circa The Blueprint?\nNM: I can’t. I have no idea what he was doing before The Blueprint dropped. It’s not that literal. People keep asking me about Jay’s The Blueprint and they think I’m doing something like that. I made reference to The Blueprint because Jay is the biggest rapper of our time. The name of the album was inspired by Jay but not the body of work. I do think that it’s going to create new rules, though, in that .\nSimilar to my opinion, Nicki denies The Pinkprint and Blueprints sonic comparability and instead agrees that itll lay down new rules. About two years ago Nicki informed the world saying, My careers been the Pinkprint. I could not agree with her more. New females shouldnt expect to receive Hip Hops formula through one album, but through every move she has made in her career.", "Rob Markman: I need everybody sit down. Everybody sit down. Everybody sit down.\nPlease give a welcome to the lyrical queen, the genius herself, Miss Nicki Minaj.\nIm good how you doing babe?\nNicki Minaj: You guys I love you so fucking much. Thank you so much for being here yall. I really freaking love you and appreciate you. I know its late and Im sorry to keep you waiting.\nI literally just left a video shoot and now I have to go back to a different shoot. Maybe you guys will see one tomorrow Im try.\nRob Markman: Uh-oh.\nNicki Minaj: But I just really, really, really appreciate your presence tonight and I wanna thank Rob for doing this.\nI had no clue that other things got added. I had no clue the thing I just had to do.\nRob Markman: Right.\nNicki Minaj: Completely did not know.\nIts been such a whirlwind for the last couple days.\nSo just make some noise for him yall cause he really—\nRob Markman: Love, love, love.\nAnd make some noise for yourselves cause yall been patient—\nNicki Minaj: Did you guys—\nRob Markman: Peaceful\nNicki Minaj: Did you guys eat?\nWait okay.\nWait you guys, we need to get—\nRob Markman: It was rough.\nNicki Minaj: We need to get them some food.\nRob Markman: Well get on that.\nNicki Minaj: So what is close around here that we can buy.\nMcdonalds? Ew\nRob Markman: Number two with the mac sauce.\nCome on!\nMiss genius we gone talk about these lyrics.\nNicki Minaj: I want some hot sauce and—\nRob Markman: Oh Lord.\nNicki Minaj: Four wings and some french fries, hot sauce—\nAlright okay. Okay now.\nNo but honestly you guys.\nG, someone can we please seriously make sure and get some food for them real quick? Can some one get some food?\nRob Markman: Well get on it.\nNicki Minaj: Some food and some like, I dont know.\nIf theres pizza around thatll be easier right?\nRob Markman: Well find some. Yeah.\nNicki Minaj: But we black we can eat some chicken and stuff right?\nRob Markman: Right.\nNicki Minaj: You know what Im saying?\nSome fried chicken and some... but Im not giving yall no soda.\nI dont want yall drinking soda no more.\nRob Markman: Its to late.\nYeah, yeah.\nNicki Minaj: I want yall to drink some water, Gatorade.\nOkay, you can get soda.\nFuck it I want some soda.\nRob Markman: Yo, Nick.\nNicki Minaj: Alright.\nRob Markman: Nick.\nFirst of all I wanna welcome you to genius because you and I have been talking about\nthis for a while.\nI dont know if the Barbs know.\nGenius we put all the lyrics out for every song.\nWe deal with a lot of artists.\nI have not met or worked with an artist before who cares this much about their lyrics.\nWhen the lyrics go up on Genius and if its one word wrong, Im getting that call and\nwe getting it right because its important for he to be represented the right way.\nAnd this is the type of artist that we need to celebrate at Genius who cares about they\nmother fucking lyrics.\nNicki Minaj: Thank you.\nRob Markman: So Nicki tonight were gonna break down some of your lyrics were gonna\ndecode some of you lyrics were gonna go through your whole catalog.\nNicki Minaj: Okay.\nRob Markman: I want for me, Im kinda selfish cause I wanna understand what goes on in you\nmind as youre creating and I know the Barbs wanna know whats going on as well.\nNicki Minaj: Yup, okay.\nRob Markman: First question, just a broad question.\nYour pen is very important to you.\nWhy?\nNicki Minaj: I think it started a long time ago before I even got a deal.\nI think it became important because we were so conditioned to believe girls didnt write\nor girls had a ghost writer.\nSo I had this huge chip on my shoulder when I first came in.\nAnd I was telling everybody,  I dont care.\nNo man is ever gonna write my rhymes.\nI dont care.\nIm gonna write.\nIm smarter that these niggas and dadadada.\nAnd so it carried me through my whole career.\nAnd If you ask any human being that has known me since the beginning of my career theyll\ntell you Ive been saying that since the beginning, since my mix tape days.\nRob Markman: Right.\nThats ill.\nAnd before we get into the specific lyrics, your process whats the process?\nI know some artist who like to write in the shower.\nI know you talk about writing in bed a lot.\nI know some artists who only write in the studio.\nI know some who use a pen and a pad, some who go off the head, some who use their phone.\nWhats Nicki Minajs writing process like?\nNicki Minaj: Well its changed.\nI have written a song in my head in the shower which has saved me a singing song.\nMost of the stuff that I sing, I dont ever write it.\nI just freestyle that.\nLike the chorus on whatever that was never written down, just like a freestyle.\nBut in terms of lyrics, recently Ive switched the approach to doing a reference type of\nmumble track on the beat.\nAnd to me, whatever I do the first time is usually the dopest flow.\nAnd I jut like to kinda keep that flow and then add words to that flow.\nI find that sometimes its a bit confining for me to try to write in the studio.\nYou know a lot of times studios are so dark and it just feels like... and I always feel\nlike its dark, I fell like Im claustrophobic or something.\nBut the minute I go on my balcony or if I even walk outside... now I have a studio at\nmy house so its so much doper.\nBut sometimes if Im in a studio it feels like Im working.\nSometimes if I put a book and a pen in front of me it feels like its work and I just cant.\nBut if I take myself away from it and Im not thinking about it, I literally wake up\nwith lyrics.\nRob Markman: \nNicki Minaj: You know, yeah because its art.\nIt shouldnt feel like work.\nIt shouldnt feel like pressured.\nOnce you start feeling like that, you loose, I think the essence of it.\nThe essence of rap is fun.\nRap started from having fun in the parks and shit like that with the DJs—\nRob Markman: Absolutely.\nNicki Minaj: And stuff like that.\nSo once it starts becoming too clinical its not that easy.\nEven though its clinical for me after the fact because thats when I wanna make sure\nevery word rhymes right and sound right and blah, blah, blah.\nBut in the beginning, for me to feel inspired is important for me to feel very relaxed.\nRob Markman: Whose the first rapper that you heard that you was like, Oh this is what\nI wanna do?\nNicki Minaj: Slick Rick.\nRob Markman: Me too.\nMe too.\nMe too.\nNicki Minaj: I love him.\nRob Markman: What was the record?\nDo you remember the record?\nNicki Minaj: Mona Lisa right?\nRob Markman: Mona Lisa, okay.\nNicki Minaj: I remember I used to be walking around with my mother singing that song and\nI didnt know that I was a little kid talking about a virgin honey needed a slap.\nAnd I dont know why my mother was letting me say that but she just, she would let me\nsay the whole entire rap.\nRob Markman: It was funny though because for me too it was like La di da di, Childrens\nstory.\nA lot of his lyrics, a lot of his songs were almost like lullabies.\nNicki Minaj: Yeah.\nRob Markman: Punched her in the belly, stepped on her feet, slammed the child on the whole\nconcrete.\nWe used to be in the playground singing that.\nNicki Minaj: Right.\nRob Markman: Thats super dope man.\nI wanna start getting into your bars and I dont know if you remember and its okay it\nyou dont because weve known each other for a few years.\nThe first time we met, we did a interview at XXL magazine—\nNicki Minaj: Mm-hmm .\nYes I do remember that.\nRob Markman: back when I worked at XXL.\nAnd first Nicki did walk in there and said, Rob and she didnt know me said, You got\negg on your face.\nBecause the freshmen cover.\nNicki Minaj: Oh.\nOh I wasnt on the XXL—\nRob Markman: Nicki—\nNicki Minaj: Me and Drake wasnt on the XXL freshmen cover.\nRob Markman: Wasnt on the freshmen cover.\nNo, listen, listen!\nBut no, thats no the point of the story!\nDid she need the freshmen cover?\nNo.\nWe know that now.\nNicki Minaj: It dont matter.\nRob Markman: I know it hurt at the time.\nNicki Minaj: No go ahead, go ahead.\nRob Markman: But she said, Man you got egg on your face.\nSo I think you came in kind of real skeptical as an MC should.\nAnd we sat down and did this interview and I talked to you.\nBeam Me Up Scotty was out and I talked to you about my favorite song on the album because\nit was the one that made me realize who you were as a person.\nAnd you couldnt believe that I listen to the entire...\nI was a journalist, hip hop journalist.\nShe was like, You actually listened to my mix tape all the way through to the last song?\nSo I wanna play a little bit of the song and a little bit of the lyric that stood out for\nme.\nCan we play that?\nCan we cue that first?\nTurn it up.\nBut when it rains, it pours for real\nDef Jam said Im no Lauryn Hill\nCant rap and sing on the same CD\nThe public wont get it, they got A.D.D\nRob Markman: Yall can keep going.\nNicki Minaj: Wow.\nRob Markman: Nick, when I heard this, this was like, Oh shes... you know we heard\nItty Bitty and the freestyles and it was like,  Yo she was really dope.\nBut it was like,  This is a twenty year career.\nThis is a legacy that could build.\nI wanna go back to this lyric.\nWhen it rains it pours for real Def Jam said Im no Lauren Hill, cant rap and sing on\nthe same CD.\nThe public wont get it they got ADD.\nCan you take me back to that?\nWhat happened with Def Jam?\nWas there a meeting?\nWhat is the stroy behind this?\nNicki Minaj: Well I think that we were being shopped and I think that...\nLet me just say this.\nEvery label passed up on me.\nEvery record company passed up on me.\nAnd every crew.\nIm from New York, Jays crew and Fiftys crew didnt sign me.\nI wasnt signed to Nas and I wasnt signed to anybody.\nSo I think it was just...\nThey really did say that number one.\nLet me just say that.\nRob Markman: Cause you just dont make that up.\nNicki Minaj: No, no, no, no.\nThey told the people that was shopping my music that.\nAnd I remember thinking, Okay so that means I have to limit myself.\nEven back then I remember thinking, if I looked a different way I wouldnt need to be limited.\nPeople always talk about, if you look a certain way you get preferential treatment but they\nnever say that it works both ways too.\nYou know what I mean?\nIf a woman dresses sexy, for the most part theyre not taken as seriously right?\nI know Im going way over here but I remember watching something on TV with my boyfriend\nat that time.\nNot at that time Im talking about recently.\nA couple years ago when Donald Trump won.\nAnd I remember my boyfriend at the time talking about, I wanna say Kellyanne is the ladies\nname.\nRob Markman: Kellyanne.\nNicki Minaj: Conway.\nRob Markman: Yeah.\nNicki Minaj: I remember that she was on stage with Donald Trump at one time and he said\nimmediately,  Oh she probably fucked him to get that job, right?\nAnd just remember my blood boiling and I was just like, Why?\nWhat made you say that?\nBecause shes an attractive lady?\nShe couldnt have been smart and attractive?\nShe couldnt have been smart and gotten here degrees and did it the right way and climbed\nup the ladder the professional, respectful way?\nAnd we really had an argument about that.\nTo me I never judge a woman that way.\nIf I see a bad ass bitch I never assume, Oh shes stupid or she got where she got cause\nof the wrong reasons.\nRight?\nYou gotta show me something else for me to think that about you.\nBut it applied to that Lauren Hill statement because, because I didnt come in there with\nwraps around my head and being certain way and them feeling that I wasnt spiritual or\nculturally aware or whatever it is, they just assumed that I didnt have depth as a human\nbeing and as a woman.\nAnd it was really, really fucked up.\nI knew what I was capable of.\nI knew that I was a layered lady.\nI knew I was multidimensional ut they took one look at me as was just like, Nope!\nShe gotta be doing this thing right her.\nSex sells and thats it we gone keep her in that box.\nAnd for a long, long time I was really, really angry about that and so I wrote about that\nhere.\nAnd now look.\nIt just dawned on me.\nI just put out Queen and Im rapping and singing on Queen and cant nobody tell me a God damn\nthing.\nRob Markman: Yeah.\nNicki Minaj: Thats my favorite album.\nRob Markman: That was my next question.\nAnd I know youve spoken before about your... the admiration you have for Lauren.\nLauren has a legacy in hip hop and music that is unmatched and a lot of people though could\nnever be touched.\nBut you know who else has one of those legacies that is unmatched and cant be touched is\nNicki Minaj.\nNicki Minaj: Thank you.\nRob Markman: I know youre confident.\nAre there days when you pinch yourself that youre on this list with the greats, with\nthe people that you looked up to.\nNicki Minaj: Sometimes.\nYou know what was one of those moments.\nYou remember that day when Jay was tweeting a bunch of people and...\nI just didnt expect to see my name as one of those people.\nAnd I remember it said Lauren Hill, Nicki Minaj and I almost just died right there because\nyou never think that somebody that you look up to and get so much inspiration from is\none day gonna tweet your name and it was after Laurens name.\nI was like, Oh my God.\nBecause all those people are people I look up to.\nRob Markman: Right.\nLets talk about this Jay Z fella because...\nWere gonna fast forward a little bit and out of present company excluded is just my\nfavorite artist, like Jay.\nI grew up looking up to Jay and we used to argue about, when Jay gets on the track with\nanybody Id argue.\nLike, Nah Jay got...\nJay and Eminem Renegade, which they argue and you know.\nNicki Minaj: Who you be saying?\nRob Markman: I say Jay.\nBut listen it was one instance when Jay was on the track with a certain rapper.\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.\nRespectfully.\nThis verse was a turning moment.\nI just wanna revisit this verse.\nCan we revisit this verse?\nYou know where we going with it.\nNicki Minaj: Rob Markman: Okay.\nWhat!\nNicki Minaj: You know they gonna do this all night right?\nRob Markman: Yup.\nAlright.\nNicki Minaj: \nRob Markman: Alright, alright, alright.\nAlright, alright , alright ,alright alright.\nNicki Minaj: Alright, okay you guys.\nRob Markman: Thats amazing though.\nI love yall energy give it up for yourselves.\nNicki Minaj: Theyre so dope.\nRob Markman: The one line here and thats rap.\nThats like when you get on the track as a MC even if respect, and I know the respect\nyou have for Jay and Kanye and Ross is on the track.\nIts still like youre not gonna body me Im gonna own my now.\nAnd we talked about this too because before you named this album I remember I was calling\nyou King.\nI said, You not the queen you the king.\nNicki Minaj: Aww.\nRob Markman: Because a lot of times, and queen is a dope title and you are the queen but\nsometimes we gotta stop this stigma where the woman MC is number two.\nNicki Minaj: Thank you.\nRob Markman: Its certain shit.\nIts about your wordplay.\nIts about your bars.\nAnd its certain field of sports where man and women...like I think Serenas the best\ntennis player on Earth.\nI think you can put her on any—\nNicki Minaj: Absolutely.\nAbsolutely.\nRob Markman: You know what Im saying?\nYou could put her up against any man and they getting bodied.\nAnd you could be the king but watch the queen conquer.\nCan you please talk about that and what was going through your mind?\nNicki Minaj: I dont know.\nThat was a long, long, long time ago but Im trying to think.\nOh I know.\nAt that time well I knew I was on Kanyes album.\nEven at that time, Kanye was a pretty big deal.\nSo I knew I was getting on an album with someone that was a big presence.\nSo I was basically talking to him.\nLike, Alright Im gonna show you something.\nI wanted to impress him so to speak and show out pretty much.\nWhen I started there was really no presence really.\nOf course there are so many women who opened the door for me but there was a drought when\nI came.\nIt was a long drought for a long time.\nSo it was just like the rebirth really.\nAnd I think that song and that was a moment in time.\nIve never seen anything like that happen.\nRob Markman: Yeah\nNicki Minaj: I remember Kanye calling me he\nsaid,  I know niggas gonna say this is the best verse on my album.\nIm taking a chance by putting this shit on here man.\nYou know what Im saying?\nAnd you no Kanye is so dramatic.\nHes so colorful, the way he talks.\nIn my head I was dying like inside I was dying because I was like, Please dont let this\nman not put this song on there Jesus!\nI was praying.\nI really prayed to Jesus.\nI was like, Lord please let him just be okay.\nI didnt know Jay Z was on it until the song came out.\nRob Markman: Were you sweating?\nWere you a little bit nervous?\nNicki Minaj: Little!\nActually Im lying.\nMonths had gone by and Kanye said I put Jay on it.\nBut of course I didnt here Jay on it so you dont know until you know.\nI didnt hear anything and I did not even wanna say can I hear it.\nI was so nervous.\nThis is to tell you how different stuff was for me at that time because now I have so\nmuch control over everything.\nIt was so different that I did not even approve the mix on my vocals.\nEverybody that know me know how crazy that is right now.\nAnybody thats in the industry they know right?\nHe took other take and put them together in one take because I did not want all those\ngrunting sounds in one verse.\nRob Markman: Right.\nNicki Minaj: And I was like, Can you please no!\nI fought him while we were still in the studio.\nI said, No, no.\nWhy are you doing that?\nWhy are you doing that?\nWhat are you doing?\nHe was like,  Nah, I like that, thats dope.\nI was like, No, no.\nIt just should be like just a couple, just a couple.\nYou know the monster voice.\nRob Markman: Right, right, right.\nNicki Minaj: And he was so obsessed with that little dumb monster voice.\nHe wanted it to be in the whole thing and I remember being so mad at him but I couldnt\nsay anything.\nI was just like...\nRob Markman: But it turned out great.\nIt turned out—\nNicki Minaj: Great.\nRob Markman: You know the fact it was that 2010 we talking about eight years later.\nIm a hip hop head.\nSo Im a talk hip hope Im not gonna talk pop with yall.\nSorry thats not what I do.\nI mean theres certain verse, I remember when I heard AZ on Nas Life a Bitch just like\nhow stand out that... its certain moments in hip

wait.\nHold on.\nI wanna play a game with yall real quick.\nWe gonna start.\nIm gonna just take three people from the audience so chill out.\nThis is Genius so we look at lyrics very differently okay.\nSo we went through all of Nicki Minajs lyrics and we counted up, if she had a son for every\ntime she said all you bitches is my sons how many sons would she have?\nAlright.\nLook we gonna do this real quick.\nMy man right there with the bandana in the back, what you think?\nAww man you raising your hand.\nYou lost.\nRight here, right here come on.\nSpeaker 1: 250\nRob Markman: 250.\nOkay

up with all you bitches is my sons\nand then when you decided to make it a thing.\nBecause the Barbs get it.\nBecause theres some Nicki haters, who I dont understand it, I dont get.\nListen, lighten.\nWhy she say you bitches is my son so much?\nThey dont get it.\nWe get it.\nNicki Minaj: Alright so, let me tell you what thats about.\nOne day when I was living in Atlanta, I was in the middle of management.\nI was looking for managers and there were three people who I was talking to to manage\nme.\nAnyway, but what Ill say is this, one of them was Puff Daddy.\nYou know Puffy managed me and ended up managing me for a very short period of time right?\nRob Markman: I was at XXL.\nThat was a confusing time.\nI didnt know who to hit to get a Nicki Minaj interview at that point.\nNicki Minaj: But look, Puff, on the fucking phone said to me... because I was like, Im\ngonna meet with you and then Im gonna have a meeting with two... and I told him who\nIm gonna meet.\nHe was like, and you know how he be stuttering when he get mad a little bit.\nHes like,  Yo check this out, Yo check this out, check this out.\nYo check this out.\nMan like all these niggas my sons man.\nAll these niggas my sons man.\nNiggas cant tell me none.\nAll these niggas my sons.\nI put the phone on mute and cried.\nI was on the fucking floor rolling.\nNo this man did not just tell me all these niggas is his sons.\nAnd were talking about executives in the industry.\nSo I was so tickled by that that trying to be funny I said it.\nNow what happened once I said is that it stuck but remember that Little Wayne...\nI dont know if yall no me, yall know that everything that Wayne did I wanted to do.\nSo Wayne had a signature.\nF right?\nSo Waynes signature is F stands for whatever right?\nRob Markman: The F is for phenomenal.\nNicki Minaj: Or F is for a bunch of shit or—\nRob Markman: F is for finisher.\nWe got a whole Genius video on Weezy F too.\nShout out to Genius we be going deep but continue.\nYup.\nNicki Minaj: So, because Wayne had that, and I thought I was the female Weezy, I said,\nOh my God.\nI need to have that be a trademark thing that I always do.\nBecause, it was so funny for a girl to say all these ... whatever, is her sons.\nAnd, Im talking about bitches when Im calling yall my sons.\nSo, it was so comical that everybody got a kick out of it.\nSo I said, You know what?\nJust to push myself lyrically, I said, Im gonna just try to keep on making up new ones.\nAnd so, I hear a lot of girls saying stuff like that now.\nAnd I be like—\nRob Markman: But thats dope, thats influence—\nNicki Minaj: Absolutely.\nRob Markman: Thats influence.\nNicki Minaj: Absolutely.\nIm not mad at that.\nRob Markman: We know where it came from.\nNicki Minaj: Yeah.\nIm not mad at all.\nBut, it started off as a joke.\nPuffy said it to me, he was dead ass serious.\nIt tickled me so much, I just had to keep it as a part of my repertoire.\nRob Markman: Thats dope.\nI didnt know that came from Puffy, thats super dope.\nThats a dope story.\nThis is the shit we trying to get to.\nHey listen, theres been a lot of Nicki Minaj interviews this week.\nI wanted to make this one different.\nThis is genius.\nI just wanted to go in a different direction.\nNicki Minaj: Did yall get their food?\nI didnt forget.\nRob Markman: Real quick, because were definitely going to get into Queen lyrics, theres a\nlot on Queen.\nI did, over the weekend, I was having a hard time just picking lyrics to ask you about,\nbecause there was so many.\nSo, I did ask The Barbs, I reached out to The Barbs on Twitter and said, Im working\nwith Nicki.\nWhat are some of your favorite lines?\nThis one was ill, I remember this one.\nI want to know if you remember this one.\nIm just going to read it out.\nNow ever club promoter, wanna bid like auctions,\nNicki Minaj: Sell ticks like Boston.\nI remember exactly where I was when I made that up.\nRob Markman: Lets go, this is what we want, lets go.\nNicki Minaj: I was driving my BMW, I was coming down the ... I think its the West Side Highway.\nIm not good with streets, or whatever, highways, whatever.\nBut I was driving in a car by myself, and I was waitressing at that time.\nAnd so, that lyric is very old, because I was still a waitress.\nRob Markman: 2008.\nSucka free, right?\nNicki Minaj: And I put that ... Oh, is that where its on?\nOkay.\nDid I ever re-use that lyric, because I feel like I did?\nOn Envy?\nRob Markman: Yep.\nNicki Minaj: I knew I would re-use that shit, because its so fucking hard to me.\nBut, I remember when I had that in my head going to the studio, because at that time\nI was still in a group.\nI remember being mad hype to go to the studio and show off to the boys in my group, that\nI had that lyric.\nBecause, I thought that was a dope lyric.\nSell ticks like Boston.\nAnd by the way, to this day, people are always confused that I spit sports metaphors.\nSo, this is what I want to say—\nRob Markman: Talk about it.\nNicki Minaj: ... yeah.\nNow, now, Im gonna give you an example, right?\nOn its a lyric that says, My—\nNo, thats not the lyric.\nNo, but thats a dope one.\nNo, but thats a dope one.\nBut, I wasnt talking about that babe.\nBut no, no, no, no.\nSwish Swish, Wichita, Wichita, remember?\nRob Markman: Yeah.\nYeah.\nNicki Minaj: Tell that bitch Im in the league, she still play for Wichita.\nSo, nobody would think that I wrote ... First of all, niggas dont even, its probably niggas\nthat have no clue what Im talking with that.\nRob Markman: Right.\nNicki Minaj: So, I literally looked up, I looked on Google, and I said, Let me find\na college basketball team, or, something that doesnt have a ... They dont play in\nthe big leagues.\nYou dont—\nRob Markman: Super mainstream—\nNicki Minaj: Yeah—\nRob Markman: ... its not obvious.\nNicki Minaj: Right.\nSo, I looked up and I found Wichita, and I just had to make it rhyme, right?\nSo, someone was asking me the other day, What would make you say that?\nYoure a girl, how do you get so in depth with sports stuff?\nI said, Google.\nIts your best fucking friend.\nAnybody that wants to rap, and this is true shit, if you want to rap to expand your vocabulary.\nI think that its very important to expand your vocabulary.\nI think its very important to be colorful in your lyrics.\nI think its very important to say shit that no ones ever said before.\nWe all say stuff that people have said before, right?\nBut, Google is my best friend.\nRob Markman: Right.\nNicki Minaj: So, I always ... for instance, Im gonna give an example.\nYou know ODell and ... no, no, and the white guy, Brad Wing?\nRob Markman: Yeah.\nNicki Minaj: He ... first, I didnt even know him.\nI had no clue who that man was.\nNever heard of him, never met him—\nRob Markman: I thought you watched sports.\nI listened to the album, Im like, Nicki be up watching ESPN like a mother fucker.\nNicki Minaj: Let me tell you what I did.\nI was writing this song for Calvin Harris, its called Skirt.\nSo, why is it I go on Google?\nI went on Google, and I literally googled Top Punters.\nYou know why?\nBecause, I wanted to rhyme something ... This is so crazy.\nRob Markman: Right.\nNicki Minaj: The lyric about punting, right?\nBut, it just happened that the line before that was Yao Ming.\nAnd when I saw Brad Wing, I was like, Yao Ming, Brad Wing, this is too good to be fucking\ntrue.\nSo, I put Brad Wing in the line.\nListen, this is crazy.\nI was not following that man on Instagram or nothing.\nI was following ODell, but I didnt know that was ODells best fucking friend.\nIts just how the universe works.\nRob Markman: Right, thats dope.\nNicki Minaj: I did not seek out to put Brad Wings name in the lyric.\nI googled Top Punting People, blah, blah, blah.\nAnd, I seen his name, I think his name was number seven, or something.\nIt wasnt the top one, but it just rhymes perfectly with Yao Ming.\nRob Markman: That so ill.\nNicki Minaj: Thats how I get a lot of my sports metaphors.\nWhen was on house arrest, they used to walk by school all day, every\nsingle day.\nThey were better in basketball, blah, blah, blah.\nSo Im there, Im absorbing the information, you know.\nIm not gonna just sit there and just be like ... People think women are dumb.\nRob Markman: Oh, come on.\nNicki Minaj: I went to an interview with L.U.G. right.\nHe said, You know how I knew you write your lyrics?\nBecause of Barbie Dreams.\nI said, Huh?\nYou believed that I write my lyrics all these years later because of Barbie Dreams?\nI said, Why?\nHe said, Because it shows that youre aware of whats going on.\nIts almost like men think that being is a woman is a handicap.\nNo, its not a handicap, were very intelligent, were paying attention.\nThe same way yall pay attention, we pay attention.\nRob Markman: But, let me tell you real quick, add to the point.\nThis is the conversations I want to have with you, because theres certain ones of us that\nlook at rap differently.\nAnd when you said Wichita, I dont know if I ever ... Rap just celebrated its 45 year\nbirthday for Hip Hop, right.\nAnd think about this, I could be wrong, but in 45 years I dont think I ever heard a rapper\nuse the word Wichita in the rhyme.\nUnlikely right?\nIt kind of reminds me of Notorious B.I.G.\nPoppa been smooth since days of Underroos.\nI never heard nobody use Underroos in a fucking rap.\nBecause, its about finding the different words and connections and building on it.\nThis is the type of shit I want to salute you for, because I dont know that you get\nenough credit.\nPeople, yall give her the credit, we know.\nBut again, when Im talking about in the span of Hip Hop, where you fit in and the work\nyou put in.\nI believe in giving people the flowers while they still smell them, so these are your flowers.\nOne more and then we gonna get into Queen.\nThis shit is ill.\nThis shit, yo, I had to rewind this back like five times, because I was like, I know Im\nmissing something.\nAnd then, I had to look it up on Genius, I aint even gonna lie.\nThats not even the plug.\nI really went to Genius, Yo, what?\nSo, can we just play this one?\nThis is from Changed It.\nYo, Nick, I done started some shit!\nListen, talk about ... Because this is a whole different technique, like—\nNicki Minaj: Hey wait, hold on, hold on!\nHold on!\nBecause, I see people doing this all the time.\nThey so fucking dumb.\nWhen they hear me saying words that sound alike, they have no idea that I just used\nit in three different ways, because theyre that fucking dumb.\nBecause, people simplify their lyrics now, so much that if theyre not hearing something\nthats an A, B, C thing, they think, Oh, next.\nWhat are you talking?\nYoure saying the same word.\nSo absolutely, No, you cant bone it, nigga, aint no Lisa here.\nShe gon dread dissin Nicki like Lisa hair.\nI buy, lil nigga, aint no leaser here.\nRob Markman: Thats hard.\nNicki Minaj: No, lets go back!\nLets go back!\nNo, you cant bone it, nigga, aint no Lisa here.\nBut wait.\nHold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.\nBecause its so intricate.\nNow, when you spell Lisa Bonets last name, right.\nIt really ... Spell Lisa Bonets last name.\nRob Markman: B-O-N-E-T.\nYeah.\nI think theres an accent there somewhere.\nIt might be an accent, theres no accent?\nI failed English.\nNicki Minaj: Yo, this is like some shit that really have to be an intelligent human.\nYou know what I mean?\nYou cant be stupid.\nSo, shout out to all the stupid bitches that think ... you know.\nYou have to have some sort of brain power to be a great rapper.\nAll of our favorite rappers are intelligent.\nJME, Wayne, you can hear it.\nYou can hear that they are intelligent people, by the way they rap.\nRob Markman: Alright.\nLets get into Queen real quick, man.\nNew project, Queen.\nI just want to know, at this point, we went through your career when you were young.\nThe things that you were learning about yourself, how you were building.\nQueen, you are a veteran in Hip Hop.\nBut, did you approach this album any differently with your writing?\nWas there anything that you pushed yourself to do, that you previously hadnt on other\nprojects?\nHow did you approach this when you started penning this project?\nNicki Minaj: One of the things that I wanted to do was definitely give them some hints\nof Roman, because I dont think I did that on The Pinkprint.\nSo, just having the fast flow and the wild stuff.\nI did that at the end of Barbie Dreams.\nI did that on LLC, a little bit.\nAnd at the end of Majesty.\nNo, no, the end of Barbie Dreams.\nI didnt do Roman on Majesty.\nRob Markman: That last verse on Barbie Dreams is crazy.\nNicki Minaj: Yeah, thank you, thank you.\nRob Markman: It was crazy.\nNicki Minaj: I love that one.\nThank you.\nBut one of the things I wanted to do, because I felt like I didnt give my fans that on\nThe Pinkprint, and I felt like they wanted that.\nWas, those kind of Roman moments, like rapping fast.\nI didnt realize how much people liked me rapping fast, until I dropped the last album.\nAnd they was like, I want ... Wheres the fast stuff?\nSo, that was one of the things that I promised myself with this album, that I would have\na couple, at least, that they cant learn right away.\nBecause, my fans get a kick out of learning the lyrics and singing back.\nRob Markman: Okay.\nOne of my favorites, because Im just a rap fan, Im sorry, LLC.\nNicki Minaj: Everybody like ... Yo, every.\nA lot of men that I spoke to ... because, even I spoke to Sway, he said LLC.\nEverybody likes that one lyrically.\nRob Markman: Its hard.\nCan we just hear?\nBecause, its an on-going theme on this album that I want to talk ... We touched on it before,\nbut I want to ... because, its on-going on this album.\nJust play this part of LLC real quick.\nNow, now, thats hard.\nNow listen.\nNicki Minaj: Thank you.\nRob Markman: We talked about in the beginning of your career, really defending your pen.\nDefending yourself from never letting a man write for you.\nI feel like you established yourself.\nI feel like you know that you established yourself as a force.\nWhy ... and even the flex interview, watching it, I had a love/hate relationship.\nThe love was the tea that was spilled, sure.\nBut, the hate was seeing you having to defend yourself, and defend your pen.\nAnd, it happens a lot on this album.\nWhy do you feel like you still have to say this?\nEven on Ganja Dreams, Im like, a lot of these ... Ganja Burns, Im sorry.\nNicki Minaj: Let him rock.\nRob Markman: I mixed up Ganja dreams.\nUnlike a lot of these hoes whether wack or lit.\nAt least I can say I wrote every rap I spit.\nWhy is it—\nNicki Minaj: No, to me, its not about what\nbitches do yall.\nThis the thing, this is the thing.\nSince Im saying these things now, its almost like I havent been saying it.\nIve always been saying these things.\nAnd because Im the bad guy, its now fun to say, Oh, shes only now posting her steps\non Instagram.\nBitch, I been the one posting my steps for the last fucking 10 years!\nBut everything I do now its, Shes doing it now for the first time.\nNo, suck my dick for the first time.\nLets start there, lets start there.\nListen you guys, this is the truth, this is the truth.\nYall know Ive been saying that since my mixed tape days.\nAnd so, after Queen, after this album, I wont explain myself anymore.\nHowever, when you have people out there lying on you.\nAnd, lying on the only thing that I care about, my legacy, my integrity.\nCan you imagine, something that you love to do, and then someone just takes it all away\nfrom you and say, You didnt do that.\nAuthenticity.\nCan you imagine?\nHold on, can you imagine?\nIm gonna kick ... Who is it?\nIm will kick you right on out.\nNo, Im going to make you sit right up here with the teacher.\nNo!\nYall are like bad kids.\nYall always been like ... Okay, no, seriously.\nRob, can you imagine, right?\nWould you consider yourself and journalist and an MC?\nI think you are, but also a journalist.\nRob Markman: Oh, you heard that?\nNicki Minaj: Yes, yes.\nThats why you pay attention in a different way.\nRob Markman: Right.\nNicki Minaj: But youre a journalist too, right?\nRob Markman: Absolutely.\nNicki Minaj: What if one day, after you had put 10 years into your journalism career,\nsomeone started going around and telling people you never wrote those amazing articles?\nHow would you feel?\nRob Markman: Its all you got.\nAll I have is the work that I put in.\nThe money, even the money that we make from it, that gets spent, the money goes.\nNicki Minaj: Thank you.\nSo, people have the audacity to be angry at me for defending my fucking craft.\nAre you fucking stupid?\nRob Markman: Well, listen, listen.\nI came up in an era where it was very important in Hip Hop for you to have written your own\nrhymes.\nI feel like, and this is just me, I fight it all the time, but I feel like Im fighting\na losing battle.\nI feel like the climate has changed.\nNicki Minaj: Its not a losing battle.\nThe climate has changed.\nRob Markman: Should I give up?\nShould we give up and just accept?\nNicki Minaj: No, no, no.\nAnd, if you want to accept it, go over there and accept it.\nAnd if you dont want to write your raps, thats fine.\nBut, dont expect to be treated like people who do write their raps.\nIm just saying.\nDont expect, dont be walking around here like you dat nigga, or you dat bitch, if you\ndont write raps.\nRappers write their raps!\nPeriod!\nSo, its fine, its fine, its fine, its fine.\nMy thing is, just stay up, keep quiet.\nKeep quiet.\nYou know how they used to say, when grown folks is talking, stay out my ... baby, baby.\nWhen writers is ... just shut the ... just relax.\nYou dont do this.\nRob Markman: Theres a certain conversation that goes on, I know at least for males in\nthe barber shop.\nYou know, if you in school and at the lunch table.\nTheres certain MC conversations that we have.\nIt doesnt mean ... Diddy has famously said, It dont matter if I write rhymes.\nI write checks.\nAnd No Way Out is a classic.\nWe can still enjoy the music, but its a different conversation.\nAm I reading you right?\nNo?\nNicki Minaj: The different is that Puff Daddy never attempts to compare himself with Biggie\nand JayZ.\nThats the difference.\nAnd the difference is, if you were to tell Puffy, You aint, da da da, he aint gonna\nargue you down.\nHe gonna let you know you damn right, and he gonna dance his happy ass around, and you\nknow.\nWhen you are getting angry that people are pointing this out, when you have come into\nour world, then you need to get checked.\nYou have come into our fucking world.\nIf you are going to fucking med school, and you go into a fucking hospital, but you aint\nnever studied your fucking med books and shit.\nAnd, passed the med tests and shit.\nYou dont think the doctors is going to be like, Hold on BooBoo.\nWhat we doing, surgery?\nYou gotta sit this one out.\nAnd you better not come in here with no mother fucking attitude.\nBe happy that you mother fucking here!\nBe happy that we letting you wear the white coat!\nRob Markman: Yo, hold on, hold on, hold on.\nBecause it gets deeper.\nNicki Minaj: And Im saying this goes for ev ... I know everybody ... I know yall wanna\nbe messy.\nThis is not about women, its about every ... its a lot of people running around here\ndoing that.\nTheres a lot of people doing that.\nThis is not just about women.\nRob Markman: Listen, theres another line on LLC.\nThis is an important record.\nTryna make a new Nicki, where the factory?\nTheyll never toe to toe on a track with me.\nTherell never be another one after me.\nCause the skill level still just a half of me.\nWhats this Nicki factory that you speak?\nWhats this factory that you speak of?\nNicki Minaj: Well, no, you guys listen.\nIts no secret ... ooh, who calling me?\nRob Markman: Yeah, its late.\nWhat is that?\nThis booty call hours right?\nNicki Minaj: Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello?\nYall made me miss my call.\nRob Markman: She said, Im gonna wait up for you.\nNicki Minaj: No, that wasnt New Boy, be quiet.\nYall so messy.\nAnd yall be telling my little business in the street.\nI be telling yall new cold stuff about New Boy and stuff.\nAnd yall be telling everybody about New Boy.\nI been wanting everybody know about New Boy.\nI did not tell anybody about New Boy.\nI told yall I was liking some tweets about New Boy, amongst us, and yall had to—\nRob Markman: So you gonna skip over my factory question.\nNicki Minaj: I aint think you was gonna repeat that.\nBut listen, you guys, heres the thing.\nIts not secret, listen, this is the thing.\nAnd, I know everything I say has this extra impact now, right.\nIts not secret that when ... Im from the hood.\nRob Markman: We know.\nNicki Minaj: In every hood, and every human being here knows this.\nYou grow up in a neighborhood with a small laundromat.\nNow, the laundromat in the neighborhood is convenient, you know the people, its fine.\nYou wash your clothes, youre in and out, its homely, its whatever.\nIn every hood, at one point in time, there will come a big laundromat thats really nice\nand pretty, and has a lot of flat screen TVs.\nAnd now, that small laundromat has to worry, Oh my God.\nAre all my customers going to leave?\nRight?\nHeres my thing.\nWhen Im saying the factory stuff, Im a business woman, and this is my business.\nI know yall get a kick out of this shit.\nI know that this is like some fun.\nYou guys have your own lives, yall get to just laugh at us all day, watch us arguing\nonline.\nLooking at the hot fucking dumb ass mess.\nBut this is my real life.\nIt is no secret that if there is a woman, a man, an alien, an anything, a burger, a\nlaundromat thats doing well, people want to replicate, duplicate, recreate.\nThats common sense, right yall?\nSo, thats not a diss.\nI want yall to learn the difference between shade.\nBecause people are always saying the word shade.\nI want you to understand that this is not a diss, thats a fact.\nThat, people have seen me being successful in the industry for a very long time.\nAnd, they want a Nicki of their own.\nIs that not true?\nOkay, so Im saying that, there were factories to create Nicki two years ago, four years\nago, five years ago, why wouldnt they?\nIf there is a young thing, they wanted to create a new Lil Wayne.\nYou dont think that they wanted to create another Eminem?\nYou understand?\nEminem is saying, Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?\nAnd all this stuff.\nSo, thats not a diss.\nThat is ... If theres a laundromat on the block, and everybody goes there, someday somebodys\ngoing to come in and say, Wait a minute, if I make a shine, real big laundromat with\nflat screens, I can take their customers.\nIf Burger King sets up shop, and theres only chicken spots in the neighborhood, one day\nMcDonalds is going into the neighborhood and say, Hmm, theres a desire for burgers\nhere.\nAnd I dont want Burger King getting all the burger money, when I make burgers too.\nRob Markman: Youre making everybody hungry.\nNicki Minaj: What?\nSo, thats not shade, that is obvious that for years and years theyve wanted their ... every\nlabel wants their own Nicki.\nA female that is profitable.\nSo, is there something wrong with me saying that Rob?\nRob Markman: I dont think so.\nBut, I want to challenge you, I want to play Devils advocate for a second.\nNicki Minaj: Sure.\nRob Markman: Well go back to this lyric, were going to play it in a second from Im\nThe Best.\nYou often talk about blazing trails for women, and kicking down doors so they dont have\nto, so its easier for the next one.\nSo, wheres the balance ... And, were going to play this lyric, because I want you to\ngo back to this.\nWheres the balance of defending your brand and what you built, you business, as you say,\nand the other lane of opening a door that other women are supposed to follow the blueprint\nthat you set?\nThats a good thing.\nNicki Minaj: Right.\nRob Markman: Lets just play this quick verse from Im The Best, these quick lines.\nIt made me think of this.\nI want to pose that question—\nNicki Minaj: I think that was a very smart thing that you just did.\nRob Markman: Thank you.\nLook, you know.\nBut, there was the criticism that Nicki Minaj is too protective of her brand—\nNicki Minaj: Excuse me!\nWhen Floyd Mayweather gets in the ring, does he try to knock you the fuck out?!\nOr, does he try to wipe your ass and kiss you and play footsies?!\nLike, what the fuck is this now?!\nYou niggas dont want rappers to rap, you niggas dont want rappers to be aggressive.\nAre you fucking for real?!\nWhen Serena gets on the fucking court, is she playing to fucking win?!\nCome one!\nOf course I know Im going to open doors, Ive opened several doors.\nEvery single person ... you know what, let me just.\nListen, what Im saying is, I think that was a very smart thing you just said, right.\nAnd I have gone out of my way to be open arms, loving, and accepting.\nAnd, Ive been completely ... People have been so fucking ungrateful.\nIts disgusting, its fucking disgusting.\nTo this day, I treat Foxy like shes the fucking queen of Egypt.\nRob Markman: Right.\nBroken Silence is a classic.\nNicki Minaj: So, my thing is this.\nWhen you open the door for somebody and then they come in and be like, Alright bitch,\nbye bitch.\nYou gonna be like, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\nMy thing is this, you dont have to be nasty.\nYou dont have to do that.\nYou can acknowledge that youre inspired.\nIts okay, we know, we know.\nSo, no, in no way shape or form PART 2 OF 3 ENDS \nNicki Minaj: So no in no way shape or form do I not think its a good thing to open doors\nbecause doors were opened for me and when I was on the come up dvds, if you play my\ninterviews, I didnt only name Foxy.\nIn all my interviews, I named several females over and over and over and over and fucking\nover.\nBut they dont tell you that story about me.\nThey only have one narrative.\nSomeone got at me, a veteran got at me and I hit them with Romans Revenge and then I\nkept on going.\nBecause what am I suppose to fucking do?\nHold on.\nHold on.\nHold on.\nWhat was I suppose to do?\nNot feed my fucking family?\nYou never gonna make me not feed my motherfucking family.\nEver.\nSo I did what I had to fucking do.\nPrior to that I was bigging them up over and over and over and over and over.\nDo I have to pull up the fucking interviews?\nDo I have to pull up the interviews?\nDo I have to pull up the allhiphop.com questionnaire when they asked me my top five and four women\nwere listed on my top five.\nRemember there was one line with Lauryn ... there was one line that said Kim, Foxy, and Remy.\nNobody remembers that.\nRob Markman: Right.\nIts facts.\nIts facts.\nNicki Minaj: I named Jay, Wayne, Jadakiss, Lauryn ... and on one line Kim, Foxy, Remy.\nGo on youtube and see how many times I said bitches names.\nBut yall training new bitches to come in and disrespect me.\nI didnt have none of that.\nI didnt have help.\nI didnt have none of that help.\nLet me tell you something.\nLet me tell you something.\nEverybody that was around Wayne, you was just around Wayne.\nI was on twitter building my fan base, getting a rapport with my fans, booking shows myself\nokay.\nI didnt have all of that shit.\nI couldnt pay a bunch of people to say they liked me and do all this shit.\nMy talents, my talents.\nRob Markman: And thats what we here to celebrate tonight.\nNicki Minaj: So my thing is I know everybody\nloves to paint me as the bad guy now.\nI get it.\nAnd therefore you guys my own culture has allowed people to come in and think they do\nnot have to respect the queen.\nCould you imagine someone coming in and treating Jay or Wayne like that?\nThey would never.\nThey would never.\nThe culture wouldnt stand for that.\nBut yall think by doing all this shit behind the scenes and gathering together that yall\nwas gonna get rid of me and somebody fucking lied.\nBecause yall not.\nYall sent somebody before and then every time yall try it everyone that tries it learns\nthe hard way.\nIm chosen.\nIm the chosen one Im not going nowhere until the fuck I want to go somewhere.\nSo the best bet for yall to do is to hope and pray that I want to push some babies out\nmy pussy because before I do that I will be right fucking here winning.\nAnd this is not in any way shade, anger, nothing this is just facts and whenever everyone else\nin this fucking world in this industry is allowed to speak.\nTheyre allowed to express themselves.\nTheyre allowed to be as dumb as they want to be.\nTheyre allowed to be you know whatever.\nLike I see so many men going on Instagram all the time having rants.\nPeople laugh it off even women laugh it off.\nWomen laugh off these men having rants all the time.\nBut women when they see another woman defending their self defending their legacy its a problem.\nThey hate their own.\nTheyre crabs in a bucket.\nWe kill our own.\nIts just about giving respect.\nThats it.\nRob Markman: And thats what were trying to level the playing field.\nThe playing field level or should be leveled in all reality.\nIts not but I feel like on them tracks when you turn those raps on youre gonna go at\nwhoever and have the best performance on the track that you could possibly no matter man\nor woman and this is what were talking about.\nYou had mentioned something making you out to be the bad guy.\nI want to go to Chun Li.\nI wonder if this is a google situation.\nI grew up a big street fighter fan like and you have a lot of street fighter you know\nwhen you and Willow in Fireball built a guest house just to put the coupe in cause Im a\nfireball, Hadouken.\nYou mentioned Chun Li before in my fantasy Im like yo Nicki she get down in Street Fighter.\nI want to play Nicki in Street Fighter man.\nNicki Minaj: I havent played for a long time.\nBut of course I think we all use to play ... but I dont know about yall but we all played\nyeah.\nRob Markman: I definitely want—\nNicki Minaj: Play me?\nRob Markman: Yeah.\nyeah.\nThat should probably be good go viral.\nNicki Minaj: All right.\nWell do it.\nI think thats cool.\nRob Markman: Not tonight this at a later date.\nBut you do know one of the things people guided you and understand was but it was a bit of\nChun Li here theres a bit of Scar Face here.\nIm the bad guy.\nI just want to clarify Nicki Minaj knows that Chun Li wasnt a bad guy?\nRight Nicki Minaj knows this.\nNicki Minaj: Right I know hes saying that because a lot of people online were saying\nthat.\nThey were like, Oh this dumb bitch think Chun Li, the fuck no Im saying that yeah\nthats the point.\nThe point is that even when youre fighting for a good cause people can flip it.\nYou can be the greatest person but ... exactly thats what I think of myself.\nI think I am the good guy being portrayed as the bad guy.\nRob Markman: Chun Li.\nThere you guy.\nOkay, this record is crazy.\nAnd were gonna play this.\nWell wind it down we definitely like getting towards the ninth ending and yall been an\namazing crowd for real.\nNicki Minaj: Absolutely, I love yall so much.\nRob Markman: This again Im telling you Nick, Im a hip hop head, this kind of heart my\nheart when I seen you drop this song off of Queen and I seen a lot of outlets reporting\nthat it was a diss track staring name and names and a lot of it happens is we live in\nthe era of quick bait so its easy to make it a diss but it pained me because people\ndidnt see the legacy of where this track came from.\nCan we hear this track that Im talking about?\nI think yall know the track Im talking about .\nHold up.\nhold up.\nNicki Minaj: Come here.\nCome here.\nCome here.\nYou come here.\nRob Markman: I think we might of made a mistake.\nWrong version but yall knew it.\nThat was a test.\nNicki Minaj: Not you but you two both of you thats okay but I was talking to this lady\nbut you can come here to.\nWhats your name?\nSpeaker 4: Its Nicole Im from Queens and I fucking love you.\nNicki Minaj: Oh my God.\nHow do you ... you seem so young ... how do you know the plays older version.\nSpeaker 4: I listen to all of your music like come on like you are my idol you are my idol\nI love you.\nNicki Minaj: Thank you.\nSpeaker 4: Im from Queen Im in Rosedale my friend lives on your old block in Baisley.\nLike I love you.\nNicki Minaj: She was really like spitting every lyric.\nRob Markman: Absolutely.\nHarell shout out Harell.\nSpeaker 4: When I first heard this I thought it was the song I was like...\nRob Markman: Listen.\nNicki Minaj: Yes\nRob Markman: Lets play the 2018 Queen version\njust—\nNicki Minaj: Hold up whats your name?\nSpeaker 5: Jaquel.\nNicki Minaj: Jaquel, where are you from?\nSpeaker 5: Queens.\nNicki Minaj: I think yall be liking me because Im from Queens or something.\nBecause I be having a lot of fans in Queens I be like how is this possible.\nAll right yall I just wanted to say I love you guys and thank you for your passion.\nAll of you guys is so lovely and passionate but thank you.\nRob Markman: Lets go Barbie Dreams.\nLets go.\nWe got the new one?\nNicki Minaj: No you guys should go back in your seats.\nRob Markman: Naw, Okay .\nThats a hard bar.\nThats a hard bar.\nNicki Minaj: And I guarantee you half of these kids in here dont even know—\nRob Markman: Thanks YaYo, 50.\nNicki Minaj: I bet yall didnt even know what that bar meant.\nRob Markman: Nick?\nNicki Minaj: Yes.\nRob Markman: Where were you when you decided to do Barbie Dreams and where you thinking\n... did you know like you know you touched this in 07?\nNicki Minaj: Yes.\nRob Markman: And a lot of people didnt know it but when did you decide you know what its\ntime Im going back in on this?\nNicki Minaj: Its been on my mind for a while and then I was dating someone right and I\nsaid I asked him what he thought and I dont think he would of been to found of it.\nSo being that we happen to break up I was able to slide that in there and I been putting\nthe bars together.\nBut one day, this is a true story but one day I was coming to the ... oh I see black\npeople moving that means food.\nWhenever black people start when you start losing their attention ... but thats okay\nyall I understand you guys are hungry you guys get food.\nIll be here talking dont worry.\nBut look so one day I just pulled up to the studio before I had my own little studio.\nBut I pulled up to the studio and Rob Im not kidding I dont know but I was in a really\ngood mood and I just started free styling some stuff like the oozy line.\nAnd I was just making myself laugh.\nAnd my assistant was in the front seat of the car and she was looking at me like what\nis she doing and i was just ... but you guys be quite a little bit.\nRob Markman: Yeah orderly be orderly.\nNicki Minaj: Because rob is gonna like this.\nThat means we got to.\nRob Markman: Because were about to get to the good part we dont want to miss this.\nNicki Minaj: Yeah so now the thug line the oozy line and the—\nRob Markman: Hes stealing your gestures.\nNicki Minaj: And it was a couple of lines that came to me oh and the designer—\nRob Markman: Nick\nNicki Minaj: Really I did not got to the studio\nthat day I was not going to that studio to do Barbie Dream.\nI promise you.\nI kept on having little lines like I was doing a voice note in my phone and all of a sudden\nthat day when I pull up to the studio it was a nice day and something just in my head had\na joke about one of the guys and I had the Fetty Wap line and I started crying and so\nI said you know what fuck that it just inspired me I was like no this shit is starting to\nbe funny.\nSo I said let me record it and then when I recorded it I did one verse first and when\nmy managers came in so G came to the studio—\nRob Markman: Shout out G.\nNicki Minaj: Shout out to G Roberson.\nNow you know G and I are like inseparable like so Gene came with him as well and I didnt\ntell them that I did it because I had already told them naw I changed my mind Im not gonna\ndo it but I laid it and I told them to come by the studio and I video taped their reaction\nto hearing it and it is priceless.\nIm put that on the documentary.\nSo that you can see when they heard that I was really about to ... because they knew\n... we knew it was gonna be game changing I kept on saying you know this is gonna change\nthe culture because Im the only one that could do because its so much history behind\nit and its just is dope that I did it in 07 you know my first mix tape.\nAnd it feels like everything has came full circle with Queen and everything feels good\nabout it the making of Queen and the way it came out and everything so I wanted to get\npeople something that would make them excited like how they were when they first started\nhearing me.\nRob Markman: And thats dope that AB did the listen to the old one and the new one.\nIf you compare the rappers that you talk about it really brings you back to a time when like\nit was a lot of Dipset talk in the first one but being from New York of course and now\nthe new version is just so dope.\nIts dope to listen to compared to where you were in 07 and where you are now with it.\nNicki Minaj: True story, I have not listened to the old version but because you said that\nI want to go and listen to it.\nRob Markman: One question I want to know, two things, it wasnt a diss track it hurt\nme when you had to tweet and explain that again Im a hip hop head so Im a spread some\nknowledge.\nHip hop has a deep history of these type of tracks if you go back to Ice Cube Jacking\nfor Beats when hes talking about stealing beats from Public Enemy.\nThose were his friends it was just a joke.\nBiggie wit Just Playing.\n50 Cent with How to Rock.\nThis is hip hop history.\nThere is a lineage of these type of tracks and this is just another chapter in it.\nBut what I want to know is and as a guy you guys have a close relationship Drake worth\n100 milly always buying me shit but I dont know if the pussy wet or Ill be crying and\nshit.\nDid he call you?\nHe had to have called you and be like, God damn Nick?\nNicki Minaj: No.\nI did an interview thats gonna be out in a few hours on TRL they asked me the same\nthing.\nNo.\nRob Markman: Shout to my man Sway.\nSee Sway is my big bro.\nHes my mentor so he asked the same questions.\nNicki Minaj: Hes so dope.\nYeah you guys think alike.\nBut Drake hasnt called me.\nRob Markman: He might be loading one up though.\nAll right you want to have fun you want to play—\nNicki Minaj: He bout to have back-to-back?\nRob Markman: Yall gonna leave Drake alone.\nNicki Minaj: No I thought that was a dope thing.\nI thought it was a compliment.\nIts funny.\nHe has a record called In My Feelings and so I thought he would like it.\nI thought it would be funny to him.\nRob Markman: Nicki do you love me?\nListen, and it was also dope to me that you mentioned Meek are you guys cool enough now\nthat you can joke about the relationship like were you worried about how people might take\nthat because what you and Meek had at a point was real.\nIs it cool enough now that you we can joke about we cool?\nNicki Minaj: Well did you see anything happen from me saying it?\nWhat?\nRob Markman: You know what I did see.\nI wish I had the picture.\nThere was a meme of a picture of Meek somewhere was like Yo Gotti in the picture like 21 but\na bunch a people looking at him like yo you did what?\nIt had nothing to do with he lyric but—\nNicki Minaj: It was like you still be in her dms?\nRob Markman: Yeah.\nYall be doing too much.\nNicki Minaj: I saw that.\nI saw that.\nThat was funny.\nRob Markman: That was dope.\nNicki man we can stay here all night because its just lyrics for days but I want to start\nkind of winding down I just want to toss it back to you and give you the floor for some\nfinal thoughts just anything you want the people to know.\nIf theres a verse or anything that we didnt touch on that I missed that you absolutely\nlove?\nI asked you\nto think about your favorite verse and that time you said thats a hard ass question.\nNicki Minaj: Well but on this album I really love Ganja Burn because to me that is so personal\nbut still hard and its very telling of where I was in life for the last couple of years\nand so I love that one.\nCome See About Me whenever I play Come See About Me I have to play that shit like 100\ntimes.\nIts so dope.\nIts so pretty.\nThe rap one Nip Tuck.\nNow that is something very serious and very true and every line on it is very real.\nVery very real.\nAnd I feel like that is the verse of the woman in 2018.\nI feel like every woman needs to get up on that and listen to that verse because weve\nall felt like that and I ended by saying because a true bad bitch aint weak or bitter and\nI think thats so important that women ... its not about being stupid or accepting things\nor taking people back or whatever but never being bitter never being bitter always allowing\nyourself to be able to love again.\nI find that thats very important in your growth as a human being so never being weak\nor bitter I felt like that even though thats not like a metaphor or some ill line I think\nits very freaking important for people to understand as youre going through life and\nyoure transitioning through relationships.\nRob Markman: Now thats dope man.\nNicki again like I said I believe in giving people the flowers while they can still smell\nthem.\nYouve done a lot of interviews throughout your career and I wanted to give you an interview\nlike this.\nWhere we talked about the pin because thats why were all here like for real for real.\nHip hop gave us so much.\nPeople have jobs because of hip hop careers that life has meaning and purpose and I didnt\nwant to lose sight of that the drama and whatever will always be there but I wanted to have\nthis moment with you and celebrate you in this moment.\nSo thank you for that.\nNicki Minaj: I really appreciate you so much and weve been speaking about this for a long\ntime off and on and you kept saying are we gonna do it?\nI know you thought I wasnt probably gonna do it any more but—\nRob Markman: Shit I thought it wasnt gonna happen today.\nI aint gonna lie.\nNicki Minaj: Im a woman of my word.\nIm a woman of my word but I do want to thank people.\nI want to thank you and people like you I dont take this for granted like because theres\nso many people especially with me personally and I dont want to have a pity party I dont\nwant anybody feeling sorry for me.\nBut I just will say that in the era of hate train its great to have people like you who\nstill understand or can try to understand why Ive been a little bit like come one guys\nare you serious you know so I really appreciate you for being authentic to our culture.\nWe need people like this.\nPeople who arent ... and let me say something I love like I can talk to someone like you\nor Sway and its not about dissing someone else.\nIts about just speaking the truth you know and speaking just in a fair way about facts.\nNot your opinion or assuming were trying to throw shade.\nJust speaking like this in a fair way, factually, and giving it up.\nI think every single artist in the industry right now did something about them to be celebrated.\nEvery one.\nSo were different.\nWe have our strengths but to me with Takashi I mentioned him in another interview.\nYou can say whatever you want to say about him right but I saw something in him that\nmade me really like him.\nHe was very genuine and of course hes from New York.\nIve done songs with other new New York rappers.\nTheres no reason why I cant do a song with him.\nHes a new New York rapper and I remember being a new New York rapper.\nAnd so its like paying it forward.\nSo thats what I did with him so shout out to him.\nHes charismatic, hes dope, hes not perfect, hes also not like the most lyrical person,\nhes not Eminem or something but theres stuff thats dope about him too.\nIm just saying every artist they should be celebrated.\nYou just cant keep on like tearing people down.\nI dont know what people get out of that you know.\nThe other thing is that you dont have to compare you dont have to compare people.\nI dont know if people understand this we all can have our own shine and have our own\nmoment and do our thing and make money and have fans and go on the road and blah blah\nblah.\nYou are a journalist.\nYoure talking to me today and someone is talking to someone else tomorrow it is what\nit is.\nYall both doing what yall love.\nYou know what I mean?\nBut Im not gonna keep on saying well you know what youre better than Sway or Sway\nis better than you or you know what youll never be Sway its like for what?\nIt doesnt do anything for anyone just let niggas rock.\nAt the same time you cant be mad at an artist for being over protective of their craft and\nof their industry.\nI take pride in what I do.\nI take pride in writing.\nThats like a basketball player Im pretty sure Steph Curry takes pride in being able\nto throw his three shots—\nRob Markman: Its called a three pointer Nicki.\nNicki Minaj: A Three pointer shut up right.\nRob Markman: Google it.\nNicki Minaj: Shut up.\nIm pretty sure that Steph Curry takes pride in that right and he should be celebrated\nfor that.\nThats his thing.\nHes not Michael Jordan.\nIm sure he could work his way to that but hes not Michael Jordan.\nBut doesnt mean that hes not dope, hes not great, hes not in the process of becoming\ngreat, blah blah blah.\nYou know.\nSwish swish.\nLook Im mentioning him Im mentioning him in my songs.\nSo hes making a mark.\nI remember when I was just coming in people didnt want me to shine.\nThey didnt understand what I was doing.\nThey didnt understand the voices.\nThey didnt understand how I was dressing.\nThey didnt understand what the hell.\nYou know.\nAnd now its like to the point where its like you know.\nSo you make your mark eventually but you just understand that everybody not gonna like you.\nI wish I wouldnt have taking things so personal in the beginning when people were judging\nme because I understand now thats like that some people they dont know how to speak on\nanyone without comparing.\nThey dont know how to speak on people without ripping one apart or so Im just like okay\nthats your thing.\nBut thats you.\nThats not me.\nI shouldnt have to examine myself and thats why I said this will be the last album that\nI feel the need to do it.\nThis will be the last promo run that I feel the need to have to do that.\nIve said what I needed to say at this point.\nNow its about enjoying the music.\nCan I just say shout to my fans 85 fucking countries number one.\nLike after being ripped apart and teared down and then you put out an album and it goes\nnumber one in 85 counties breaking a new record.\nAnd I mean thats something to be proud of and Im very proud of it.\nI thank God.\nI thank my fans.\nYou guys stood by me.\nYou guys waited for such a long time for this album.\nSo I want to thank you.\nYoure such a small number in this room but you represent to me millions of people around\nthe world who are fucking loyal and dope.\nSo I wish you guys the best in your careers and your futures as well.\nPush yourself as well.\nOkay.\nRob Markman: And with that.\nNicki Minaj.\nLyrical Queen.\nGive it up.\nLove you Nick.\nNicki Minaj: Thank you.\nI love you

He maybe shouldn’t have given that opinion\nNM: I’m going to answer your question but you gotta stop talking\nFF: That’s the first time you’ve ever told me that Wayne has ever overruled you. It happens. It’s a label. We couldn’t do anything to fix the situation\nNM: Flex\nFF: I’m here\nNM: Flex. I need you to breathe. You’re not even listening and I need you to simma. For three hours, we emailed , and actually, my manager was the first person to tell me: Yo, you’re not going on that stage. Wayne was the second person. For three hours, we could not get a resolution. G. Roberson emailed me, and said: Hey, I need you on the phone. Ebro said ‘Let me get to the bottom of this.’ You know I love Ebro. After he sent that email, we never heard back\nFF: But you know something?\nNM: Can I finish?\nFF: Damn, okay\nNM: Flex. Flex. My label and program was reaching out to the manager\nFF: Now I understand the reason that you did it. And I’m listening to you. When you went to Twitter, and you did that, we felt that you were making an issue, and you were trying to put us on Front Street\nNM: Ohhhhh. Ohhh. Okay. He tried to embarrass me, but I can’t embarrass you\n9:31 PM\nNM: Flex, if you’re gonna just say wrong information blatantly like that, then ask me a question, because I’m not here to play games\nFF: That’s a nice way of calling me a liar\nNM: Well, I want you to know that we wanted to do the show\nFF: Well, now that you said that…. We’ll be back, we’ll be back. I’m gonna rewind that\n9:39 PM\nFF: Everyone was wondering if you were really gonna touch the stage. I’m just keeping it real with you. Nicki, look: There were people who were wondering if you were afraid to step on the stage. I’m not saying that’s how I feel, but people feel that way\nNM: Do you see the kind of places I’ve gone to? Did you see how many people we were with yesterday? We were two-hundred deep. Let’s not go there. There isn’t a bitch alive—and when I say bitch, I include men, because you’re a bitch when you act like that—that could scare me from performing a show. I get money. I get money. Flex…\nFF: \nNM: Flex…I’m not even going to say what could’ve happened yesterday, and please don’t interrupt. Relax. Relax. This is the real reason why I called you. You said something about my record sales\nFF: Yes, I did\nNM: And I want you to pull up your roster from everyone who was performing on your show. My first album sold 375,000 copies in its first week. My first album has gone on to sell 3.5 million records. My second album is at 900,000 worldwide, plus a three million selling single. If you don’t know, call Matt Voss at Universal, Flex, do the math, m-a-t-h, that’s one-point-two-million on my second album. Even without the single, I’ve sold. Three. Point. Five. Million. Albums. In Two Years. I want you before you ever open your mouth—it’s so misleading, when I saw Foxy Brown, she said, Nic, why are they saying things about your sales when you’ve gone number one in four countries? You know who the last one to do that was, Flex? The person previous to me was Eminem in 2010\nFF: But you know what? We’re not talking about LAST NIGHT, IN JERSEY, AT SUMMER JAM. I didn’t go at you because you’re a woman, I didn’t go at you because of that, I went at you because you’re an artist performing at Summer Jam. I’m not going at Wayne. What did you think? Did you think all that was gonna happen and nobody was gonna say nothing?\n9:47 PM\nFF: We’re being attacked, by your team, so I’m expressing myself, I’m not going to go tit-for-tat with you\nNM: I appreciate that you owned that\nFF: I didn’t say your albums are trash\nNM: I appreciate that. But let me say this: In the history of the hip hop world…there has been one, single, solitary human being in the history of the world. One female rapper to sell more albums than me in the first week\nFF: Nicki, I’m gonna reel this in for you. We’re talking about album sales. A lot of the people that bought those albums last night were in Summer Jam\nNM: That’s right. So I’m gonna have a free show, for my fans, sometime this summer, in New York\nFF: BUT DID WAYNE DO THE RIGHT THING?\nNM: I need you to simma. Listen, Flex. I need you to calm down\nFF: DID LIL’ WAYNE MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION? YES OR NO?\nNM: I…I…\nFF: UH-UH. YES OR NO. DID LIL’ WAYNE MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION TO PULL YOU FROM THE SHOW?\nNM: Capital Y. Capital E. Capital S. R-E-S-P-E-C-T\nFF: YES? YES? ARE YOU SAYING YES?\nNM: I just spelled it out for you. People are gonna know the truth. And every woman is going to know. People are laughing, Flex. They’re gonna know the truth\n9:53 PM\nFF: Hot 97 does a concert\nNM: Yes, but Flex…\nFF: We’re known around the world. And you’re known around the world\nNM: Flex, I’m getting off the phone. All you’re doing is talking over me. \nFF: I am not talking over you. You are at fault and we are at fault too. We are both at fault. Egos were involved. Not just in the beginning part of it—and I will speak for myself as well—my ego, your ego, Wayne’s ego, Ebro’s ego, all of our egos were involved, and the people suffered and DID NOT SEE Nicki Minaj, Wayne, and DJ Khalid. And Foxy and Kim\n10:01 PM\nFF: Look, you gotta kinda rock with me on this. I already said Rosenberg didn’t pick the right time and place to say that. But Wayne should not have taken his artist\nNM: I love my team. And you gotta respect that\nFF: But now I take it to Wayne. And he should not have made that call. If people are on the phone when they already know that Nicki’s not performing, we feel like we’re up against the wall. But how’re we gonna fix this? Wayne’s wearing two hats. He’s artist and label. Wayne was a featured guest. The fans didn’t buy the tickets to see Wayne, they bought them to see Nicki Minaj. As the label guy, I was diappointed\nNM: I got it, I got your feelings. Are you gonna let me talk? You’ve already made your opinion clear, and nobody’s opinions seem to be changing. I just want to apologize to my fans for what happened last night, and like I said on Twitter, I’m going to make it up to them with a free concert. And they said you know what Hot 97? When you want our team to come to your show, treat us with respect. And that’s all we’re asking. We’re not asking for any special treatment. Just respect. And I’m very proud of my team, and the way they stood behind me—and I’m very happy to show my female fans in that audience, and even my gay fans in that audience, when I’m coming to your home, respect me. It’s no longer comedy. Wayne doesn’t take me as a joke\nFF: I’m asking you a question before you get off the phone. Last night’s issues between all of us has not been just about last night. Can we agree?\nNM: Yes! Flex, I’m telling you the response to that was it got to an all-time level of disrespect\nFF: Does Hot 97 deserve an apology Nicki?\nNM: I stand behind it! No, no radio station that allows someone to disrespect me before I go on stage deserves an apology. And I know you respect it. Say it\nFF: No! You’re trying to bully me. I know what you’re trying to do\nNM: Flex, we’re talking in circles\nFF: But can we agree that we’ll respect each other?\nNM: Yes. We can do that. All I ask is next time we go forward, we get respected. We need to know that the person who disrespected me is going to apologize—I don’t need an apology, I just need…\nFF: BUT CAN WE SAY YOU’RE GOING TO DO SUMMER JAM NEXT YEAR?\nNM: I’m gonna have to talk to Wayne, and Baby, and…\n10:14\nFF: You know what, Nicki? I want to be honest with you. I think you’re putting me in a position at this particular moment. You’re putting me in a position . I don’t think I should get off the phone with you right now, I don’t want to be in a position to say sorry\nNM: Were you wrong, or not?\nFF: You know what, Nicki? I’m not wrong in defending my team\nNM: When you said something about the streets, and sales, I just want you to know that I’m never mad when you don’t like something, but when you give facts to the world, they take what you say as the truth\nFF: That criticism comes with the game. Once the crossover stations, even if they take one of your gutterist hip hop records and play it, we’ve seen this with 2Pac, Biggie, everybody, if we’re going to have this conversation, Nicki, you are particularly sensitive to it\nNM: What, the whole pop thing?\nFF: Yeah. They say it about every rapper\nNM: It’s not about pop, Flex. It’s about disrespecting an artist\nFF: Are we fleshed out? Are we cool?\nNM: Just run the entire interview. Don’t chop nothing else. I will tell you this one last thing: When I sat in the restaurant last night with my team, Beanie said, Nicki: Do you know what would happen if someone in Jamaica went on stage last night before I performed to the crowd? He said niggas would be in the hoes-pit-al. But let me tell you: Nothing is worse than going home and having not played a gig. I just wanna leave with saying this: I’m gonna make this up to my fans. And I want my fans to know, nothing, no radio station, no one can alter our relationship. I have a very personal relationship with my fans, and I’m truly sorry that people’s nights were ruined. You guys have no idea, I’ve gone through hell and back. I’m not a quitter. I show up and perform. I went with my team’s decision, and I made history, and the next time I come out, people won’t disrespect me. And for once, I feel like I’ve really really shown the world, I love and respect myself, and people aren’t gonna go there any more. And you know what, Flex? Hit me on the email, it’s all good\nFF: We rocked out, we’re gonna continue to rock out. Okay?\nNM: Okay. Just put up this whole interview and we’re fine. Okay?\nFF: Okay\nNM: Bye\nFF: Bye", "Do my ladies run this mother for ya? Hell ya\nOr do my fellas run this mother for ya?

Whats hard is sustaining that rapid ascendance to the top\nTo become a mainstay in the music industry, it takes multiple hit songs, impressive live performances, educated sit-down interviews, and an extremely hard work ethic to create a superstar. It also requires you to earn the respect of your fellow peers – because, let’s face it, how can someone be labeled a “superstar” without having earned the respect from fans, the media, and even other artists?\nAnd while it’s not often that a new superstar emerges, if I had one word to describe Nicki Minaj and her meteoric rise to fame, it would be just that – superstar\nWe all know the backstory – Nicki was born in Trinidad, moved to New York City as a child with her family, had a rough childhood as her father, attended LaGuardia High School , and was eventually signed to Lil Wayne’s Young Money label\nDuring the lengthy bidding war for Nicki Minaj, which involved various record labels, Lil Wayne had hopes that she would eventually sign with him and become the “First Lady of Young Money”. After some persuasion, as well as a $5 million dollar signing-bonus, his dream became a reality\nThat following year, as we all know with the release of her debut album, “Pink Friday”, a superstar began to emerge…\nWhat’s so ironic about the accelerated rise to fame for Nicki Minaj is that the adversity she had to deal with as a child isn’t even the biggest obstacle that she had to overcome to be a star\nThe real hurdle in her way, and one that has caused problems for many female rappers of this past decade, was making a name for herself in the male-driven and male-dominated world that is rap\nWith a large amount of guest appearances to her name – including being featured on songs by hip hop heavyweights Kanye West, Jay-Z, and Beyoncé and on songs by pop icons Mariah Carey, Madonna, and Britney Spears – Nicki made a name for herself by outshining her more-established peers on their own songs\nAs the most successful commercial female rapper of all-time, Nicki also proved that she could compete for airplay on Top 40 radio with smash hits like “Superbass”, “Starships”, and “Moment For Life”. No longer was she confined to creating singles for urban radio, but she was now a bonafide-hit across all genres\nNow, with a staggering net worth of over $50 million, Nicki has proven that she can hang with any male rapper in the game bar-to-bar, create radio-friendly and chart-topping hits that rival those of pop’s biggest acts, and attract the attention of huge brand names like Coke, Pepsi, MAC, and Adidas for multi-million dollar endorsement deals\nIf that’s not the power of a superstar, then I don’t know what is", "Far from a rookie, man Im far from an amateur\nRappers hit the booth and then they turn into characters\nWord to my record label, word to my manager\nLife is like a fucking red number in a calendar\nEvery day a holiday, Im buttoned up, my collar straight\nWe Disturbing London make them niggas do geography\nSame Nikes on but nigga mine are different colour, wait\nNow my face up in the Source and I aint talking hollandaise\nYeah I just shitted on em\nI like my women nice and thick with no knickers on em\nEvery message on my phone has got some kisses on em\nAll my shows sold out, no tickets for em\nAll them niggas is my sons \nI just shitted on em, I got the runs\nAll I see is numbers, nigga sums\nI number twod on number two, one\nAll these bitches is my sons\nAnd Imma go and get some bibs for em\nA couple formulas, little pretty lids on em\nIf I had a dick, I would pull it out and piss on em\nLet me shake it off\nI just signed a couple deals I might break you off\nAnd we aint making up I dont need a mediator\nJust let them bums blow steam - radiator\n Shitted on em\n Man I just shitted on em\n Shitted on em\n Put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em\n Shitted on em\n Man I just shitted on em\nShitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em\nThis stone is flawless: F1\nI keep shooters up top in the F1\nA lot of bad bitches beggin me to eff one\nBut Imma eat them rap bitches when the chef come\nThrow some fresh ones\nMore talent in my mufuckin left thumb\nShe aint a Nicki fan then the bitch def dumb\nYou aint my son you my muthafuckin step-son\n Shitted on em\n Man I just shitted on em\n Shitted on em\nPut yo number twos in the air if you did it on em\n Shitted on em\n Man I just shitted on em\nShitted on em, put yo number twos in the air if you did it on em", "Lyrics will be available upon release.

robot arm used for laparoscopic surgeries. It is a peacock navy color, dark and shiny and full, extending maybe a not-outrageous half centimeter up from the top lid, extending an additional still-not-crazy three centimeters outward past where her eyes end. Her eyelashes are even and delicate, like wisps from a dandelion, and I cant recall if Ive ever seen her without prosthetic versions. I have had plenty of time to search my memory, though, because here on this couch, in this room, during this interview, with me sitting next to her, Nicki Minaj has fallen asleep\nWe are at Barclays Center in one of the dressing rooms, which are low, low beneath Brooklyn; most are named after streets and neighborhoods in the borough. During the rehearsals for Fashion Rocks, the New York Fashion Week concert fund-raiser, the halls were filled with publicists and escorts who had to pretend not to be dazzled by those they were escorting. Minaj had walked in a few minutes before, tiny next to her assistant and her muscle, wearing black sunglasses, a trucker hat cocked to the side, and a T-shirt with the periodic-table box for carbon. She had been led straight into the DeKalb dressing room, named for the street that bisects a couple of local neighborhoods now populated by yuppies but that still contain housing projects. Her smile is a warm sun. As is this room. The temperature in here has been set to about 300 degrees, at Nickis request. She says she gets cold a lot\nNext door to her is the Canarsie dressing room—I actually grew up in Canarsie; its still a dump—and inside is Usher, who at the MTV Video Music Awards last month slapped Nickis ass and continues to slap it endlessly in GIFs all over the Internet. Nicki was the star of the VMAs that night. Her hot, humpy performance of Anaconda was part of a medley, and it was followed by a quick costume change that didnt quite reach completion: She had to pinch the two breast-covering flaps of her black dress closed, because her cue for the finale of the opener, Bang Bang, with Jessie J and Ariana Grande, came before she could zip. She power-walked in like a boss, joining the other two onstage, both of them so skinny and with such rough angles and straight edges and reaching so hard for some soul. Nicki destroyed them\nThis is what she does. She takes a pretty good song, waits until you are popping along to it, then a little longer, until it feels repetitive and you start to see through to its flaws, and then boom, she comes in and makes it a completely different song—a better song. She is the best part even of great songs; her featured verse on Kanye Wests Monster is the best of several, including ones by Jay Z and Rick Ross. She did that song because she was asked and because Kanyes a genius. She did Bang Bang because she knew it would be big.\nIn the dressing room on the other side of Nickis, the Empire, named after a boulevard in Brooklyn that sounds regal but is even rougher than Canarsie ever was, is J.Lo. I could write a dissertation about the two seconds during which MTV caught J.Lo watching Nicki do Anaconda at the VMAs. Perhaps J.Lo, in those seconds, stares at Nicki and considers her own youth, and also that this is what she has wrought, that back when she brought this whole butt thing into the mainstream all those years ago, she went out of her way to be discreet, to keep us wanting more, to never let us look her ass directly in its eye, that it was an ass of implication and innuendo—that, if she may, she made asses safe for the white folks at home in a way they never had been before. Who knew that just giving the people what they wanted would yield such success? In those two seconds, J.Los look is a mixture of pride and despair\nIt has been counterpointed to me that perhaps J.Lo was just thinking of how far wed all come, that now we can all celebrate our asses. I dont know; maybe if she didnt have a new album out, Id agree. Contact me to debate this; I will make myself available. I want to talk about asses so much. I want to know what it is were telling the world when we use our asses in the way that Nicki has been using her ass—when they are not the accent in a video but the point of it\nAnd most of all, of course, I want to know Nickis thoughts on this. I was awake there in the DeKalb, and I had questions. She was asleep, which was fine, I suppose, because she didnt appear to have answers, anyway\nThe Versus Versace party shed attended the night before our interview had yielded a plastic case filled with M&Ms—an odd party favor, something Ive received at bar mitzvahs. She pulled it out of her purse as we talked in the basement of Barclays, and this would be my only indication that she recognized she needed a boost. The case was taped closed, so I offered to open it for her; her nails, a pointy taupe manicure, were making it hard. We ate some together, and she noticed that they each had the Versus lion insignia on them. Isnt that crazy, she said, impressed\nShes into branding these days, particularly her own. In the Anaconda video, there are no fewer than five products placed prominently for advertising: her Beats by Dre speakers imprint and her Moscato but also a Victorias Secret bra, some Air Jordans, and a baffling teatox drink called MateFit . Its not exactly seamless integration, and at times it is so overt that it feels like a comment on the culture of branding, maybe some poignant thought about sex and consumerism?\nNope. My management team has a division that has a guy that his main focus is to go out there and find new brands for me to do business with or to find brands that would like to be in our videos and contribute to our budget, she says. Its like a Kickstarter, but for a multi-millionaire\nShe was not born wealthy. Nicki, 31, grew up in Queens and attended LaGuardia, the high school from Fame. She says her father once tried to burn down her house while her mother was inside. She did odd jobs after school: She was a customer-service rep for a while, but that didnt go great. I like dealing with people, but I dont really like a lot of bullshit, so maybe customer service wasnt the best job for me. She was fired from a waitressing job at a Red Lobster after she followed a couple who had taken her pen into the parking lot and then flipped them the bird. I asked her if it was a special pen. No, she said. It was the principle.\nShe came to prominence in outsize, italic, caps-lock, Technicolor exaggeration—pink wigs, outrageous outfits, eyelashes that were a comment about eyelashes. She had different personas—alter egos, she called them—with names and backstories. She did funny accents and was willing to make herself beautiful, then grotesque, then absurd, then back again. And here she is now, demure by comparison, just plain old black extensions, just a T-shirt about carbon\nI always thought that by the time I put out a third album, I would want to come back to natural hair and natural makeup, she told me. I thought, I will shock the world again and just be more toned down. I thought that would be more shocking than to keep on doing exactly what they had already seen.\nShe no longer feels as if she needs to hide behind outrageousness. This next chapter is about success. Nicki Minaj is raps first and only female mogul, having parlayed all your ogling into a spot on Forbess Cash Kings list—the only person of our gender paid well enough to be so honored. She is the top-charting woman in rap, a top-charting rapper in general, and a crossover phenomenon who can go back and forth between hip-hop and pop the way Taylor Swift can no longer go back and forth between country and pop\nA few days earlier, shed been in Los Angeles finishing up her third album, The Pinkprint, out this month, and shes changed things a billion times because shes a perfectionist. Her first two albums were big hits, platinum sellers. Already The Pinkprint has yielded a chart-topping single and an unstoppable meme—the Anaconda cover art features Nicki, pants nowhere in sight, squatting, photographed from behind—but also a quieter Nicki, and certainly a more tired one. She cant be baited into talking shit about anyone anymore; she answers questions simply and succinctly\nNow that we have charted her rise as a cultural force, it is time to ask Nicki exactly what shes trying to say. If the Anaconda cover is the autumn of her flamboyance, it is time to get what weve wanted all along: an explanation of what exactly is going on here, which is something I will ask her the minute she wakes up\nTo be completely accurate, she never fell into actual REM sleep during our interview, but at four separate times she dozed off, her head jerking awake at just the moment it had started to dip. In between, she was what I could call low-key and reserved, because I am generous, but the picture looked like this: those eyelids, falling, falling over eyes that would cross momentarily, closing for a moment but staying too long—a blink that lasted a few blinks longer than a blink\nBut also, to be completely fair, Im not sure how she was upright at all. This was the middle of New York Fashion Week, and if you followed her Instagram, every few hours it was a new event with a new dress, new hair, new makeup. It was parties all night, all the air-kissing, all the red carpets\nAnd of course all this fancy dress-up plays into the sort of bodily performance art shes been doing onstage and in her videos since her first mixtape, in 2007; that release was called Playtime Is Over, and on the cover she was a plastic doll in a box. She has put herself in a Barbie box at least twice, actually, the second time in a video with Mariah Carey. She is among the few living women in Kanyes Monster video, which is a landscape of female corpses—the strangest video I ever shot—and there are two of her in it; one her ties up and whips the other her with a riding crop. And now comes this song and video, which are clearly about the female form and the male obsession with it. She must have something to say about this\nNo, she says, its just a song, theres no hidden meaning, no layer beneath. She—Nickis character in the video—is just talking about two guys that she dated in the past and what theyre good at and what they bought her and what they said to her. Its just cheeky, like a funny story. Cheeky. She has to be messing with me\nBut Anaconda samples a song thats literally called Baby Got Back. There must be some thought given to this part of the body, considering all the attention it receives. Choreography points to it; she boosts it up and it receives applause. The song is a five-minute gender-studies symposium\nBut Nicki shakes her head: All it says is, My anaconda dont.  Why are we talking about asses? she seems to be saying. Sure, there is a direct, not inferred, reference in her lyrics to salad tossing—which, to be clear, is the act of being anally probed by someone elses tongue. But this is a song about reptiles. Dont be such an intellectual!\nOkay, fine. You cant deny the video, though. You cant pretend that there isnt some extreme sexual commentary going on in the video, right? A steamy womens-only jungle mecca, aerobic slithering, drumming on a dancers ass. There, in the video, Nicki is twerking and crawling across the floor to poor, hapless Drake, sitting in a puddle of his own anticipatory blue balls. She slaps him before he can touch her, and that has to mean something.\nI knew that I wanted a gym theme. Shrug. And thats that. Thats that, guys. Thats that\nShe sees me grasping, and maybe she feels a little sorry for me, so she offers me this: I think the video is about what girls do. She is poking at a salad that hasnt been tossed. Girls love being with other girls, and when you go back to us being younger, we would have slumber parties and wed be dancing with our friends. \nOkay, the Anaconda cover art, then. It was almost an afterthought, she says, the product of a photo shoot on the day that the Anaconda video was shot. I just said Ill put it out, never thought in a billion years that people would be putting peoples heads on it. Its the craziest shit. I tell her that online Id seen it as a rocket, jet fuel and fire being released from her undercarriage. What hasnt it been? she says. Theyve made it everything.\nYou heard it here first. Anaconda is about a snake, and also about a womans ex-boyfriends, and the video is just one big slumber party. You can release a record cover into the atmosphere that makes all who see it so shocked and discomforted that their only way to metabolize it is to turn it into the worlds fastest-spreading meme, to the point where her squatting form ends up on a polo shirt, right where the little crocodile usually goes. You can do all this, and still you can look someone in the eye and say that its not cynical in the least, that its not a comment on gender or sex or the culture or anything. Double shrug. These are not the droids youre looking for\nI dont know what there is to really talk about, she says. Im being serious. I just see the video as being a normal video.\nWe are winding down, because its time for Nicki to go rehearse. For this performance, she has incorporated male dancers. I went in yesterday, finally saw the dance for the first time, and I saw the guys doing all this sexy stuff that I wasnt a part of. And I said, Hello, why arent they humping me on the stage?  The choreographer didnt realize that this was something she might want. She does: Weve got to give them something to talk about again.\nSo its all for shock, its all for talk, its all for hashtags and memes. Not even a contrived statement—which is fine, its just that most people at least pretend theres something theyre trying to say. And so Im left to wonder, where is the woman who pronounced in an MTV documentary that she wont stand for disrespect, that she wont accept being given pickle juice at a photo shoot? Where is the philosophy and the fire? And there in the DeKalb, where it is so hot I can see sound, I start to wonder if Im losing it. I look over to ask Nicki, to suggest that maybe I should take a nap, too, and we can let our unconsciouses figure this out—I could be her hype man, but for naps!—except she is out again\nThe next night, at Fashion Rocks, J.Lo went on before Nicki. The song she performed was called Booty, and the only lyrics I could discern were Big, big booty / what you got a big booty again and again, J.Lo marking her territory. If you could troll Nicki Minaj through a song, this was it. J.Lo wore a short dress and did a move you mostly see strippers do on cop shows—Ill call it the squatted twerk: knees bent, up down up down up down, butt close to the ground but never touching it. We clapped loudly for this. A woman behind me who has no idea how the record-promotion business works panted to her companion, I hope Nicki does Anaconda. \nRight before I left her the previous night, Nicki had stopped me, and maybe because she felt bad for me and maybe because she, too, is generous, she had given me two things—a ticket to this show and this tiny morsel:\nIm chopping up the banana. Did you realize that?\nWhat? What banana?\nIn the Anaconda video, she says. At first Im being sexual with the banana, and then its like, Ha-ha, no.  I ask if shes referring to how the Drake scene immediately follows the kitchen scene. Yeah, that was important for us to show in the kitchen scene, because its always about the female taking back the power, and if you want to be flirty and funny thats fine, but always keeping the power and the control in everything.\nMaybe she had been messing with me all along\nOr maybe she was simply telling me that it is not her job to explain herself. I had been warned before the interview that I shouldnt ask about her ass, that she finds it degrading, and I had chalked up her reticence to that. But maybe this is what she finds degrading: to work day and night to get those features down, to make actual magic and to make it come out in full articulation, every syllable, every accent, meticulously applied to save someone elses song in the third act, to entertain you, only to have some asshole come down to the DeKalb dressing room in the two hours that she could have spent taking a real nap, not an upright one, and ask her what she means when shes doing the thing she does. Must she do everything? Shes not hiding anything—look at her, she literally isnt hiding anything. Its all there for you to see. Do some of the work yourself, people. Shes busy running her brand. Shes inspiring a meme that will keep us busy for months. She is tasting the Moscato and smelling the Nicki Minaj perfume that comes in miniature busts of Nicki Minaj. She is not here for your gender-studies symposium. It is not her job to tell you who the eff she is. And shes exhausted. She is only made of carbon after all, just like you and me\nShe came out in her sparkle bra, tearing fiercely across the stage. Bwoy twoy named Trwoy used to live in Detrwoit.… J.Lo was already re-seated and watching the performance, and at first she clapped along lazily, but then stopped. For a variety of reasons, it is hard to parse what might be going on in J.Los mind by looking at her face, but when Nicki launched into her own dancer-backed squatted twerk—a younger twerk, a bouncier twerk—I swear I saw J.Los left eyelid blink out of sequence with her right one, a subdermal twitch indicating that perhaps shed had a rage stroke\nMeanwhile, onstage, Nicki was hoisted up by the male dancers, arms in the air in full expression, and the sunshine of her smile shone into the arena. She was all rested up", "Chingy-ling, Soulja Boy , Gucci Mane \nYall know who it is, huh?

When those comparisons wore thin, everyone decided it was Lady Gaga she was biting. But the mark of any great artist, and intelligent business person, is the ability to adapt. Just look at Jay Z.\nIn the 90s, Kims lisp-like flow and eagerness to talk about her  were accentuated by her colorful oversexed style. she never completely crossed over into the mainstream. Maybe that’s why she decided to chisel her cute Brooklyn-girl face only to end up with a grill people now have a hard time looking at. Instead of doubling down on her core fanbase she jumped off the deep end.\nLady Gaga, like Nicki, is lambasted for a lack of originality. But Gagas over the top, alien-like fashion sense was all her own. She caught everyones attention by wearing everything from floor-length wigs to ass-out leotards. Her timing was perfect. Her success seemed unattainable by any other female artist save for Adele. Then I realized that she absolutely sounds like Madonna, and I got tired of hearing about that damn meat dress. Turns out I wasn’t alone. How did Gaga attempt to stay relevant? She became an almost unrecognizable man at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards and a couple years later, birthed a giant bubble. Lame, I thought, along with everyone else, as her career took a nose dive.\nAnd just when it seemed like everyone was tiring of the antics, the voices, and the ultraviolet wigs, and it looked as if Nicki was going to fail in the same way Gaga has, she morphed back into herself—a gutter, black-haired chick from Queens who raps her ass off. Except this is not the old Nicki. Shes in a new movie with Cameron Diaz. Shes more mature, more rich, more stylish, and more interesting. That plasticky Barbie persona, the annoying Roman character, and her American Idol bid, may have disappointed rap fans, but it made her a ing household name. And now that most of America—or the world, rather—is in her vortex, Nicki is going natural and is back to scoop up her original fans. In a short time, Nicki achieved the versatility that took Queen Latifah over 20-some odd years. Nicki can literally do whatever the hell she wants. We should all be thankful that shes decided to come back to rap.", "Lyrics will be available upon release.
