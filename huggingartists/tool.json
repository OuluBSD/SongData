It was a red car and it was new. There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat. Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods. You began to walk towards them. Now red was your color, and of course, those little people out there were yours too", "NURSE: Excuse me, doctor? If you have a moment.\nDOCTOR: A moment?
