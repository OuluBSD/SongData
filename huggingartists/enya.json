the tumult and the strife\nI hear its music ringing\nIt sounds an echo in my soul\nHow can I keep from singing?\nWhat though the tempest loudly roars?\nI hear the truth, it liveth\nWhat though the darkness round me grows?\nSongs in the night it giveth\nNo storm can shake my inmost calm\nWhile to that rock Im clinging\nSince love is lord of heaven and earth\nHow can I keep from singing?\nWhen tyrants tremble in their fear\nAnd hear their death knell ringing\nWhen friends rejoice both far and near\nHow can I keep from singing?\nIn prison cell and dungeon vile\nOur thoughts to them are winging\nWhen friends by shame are undefiled\nHow can I keep from singing?", "One day, one night, one moment\nMy dreams could be tomorrow\nOne step, one fall, one falter\nEast or west, over earth or

in, all them times when we got baked in the park\nLook if you take me apart, youll find half of me is you\nBut half of me is asking me to start anew\nYou look the same but I dont recognise you\nIm

still to this day do I know him\nI love him very much, its very hard for me to show him\nBack then and even now I feel theres something that I owe him\nAnd that feeling should be going over time but no its growing\nWe was kid mates making mistakes, playing give-take\nBig hearts battling them big snakes rattling their tails\nHe was like the wind in my sails\nI was like the water for his keel – it was real\nIt used to hurt my flesh that his worn scars are heated still\nWe used to hurt his flesh just to see if he could feel\nTo cut a long short, he was never really the strong sort\nGot into the wrong sport – big swigs, long snorts\nCaught in that spiral, saw attempts to help as spiteful\nAnd soon he got so down that he got on the brown, word got around\nPeople did not like the sound, they told me to stop popping round to see him\nI kept disagreeing, soon he was a different being\nHe got into stealing, robbing, I still see him frequent, often\nEyes are throbbing, weeping, sobbing, freaking out when I speak about\nThe things that made him weak, cause that would stop his throat mid-sentence\nFace would paint repentance but his actions spoke dependence\nFriendship became difficult to say the least, he played the beast\nSo well I wondered how wed ever make our peace\nThats when we drifted – never argued – it just became clear:\nThe parts of him I loved so well had slowly disappeared, but...\nReady or not, here I come – you cant hide\nIm gonna find you and take it slowly\nReady or not, here I come – you cant hide\nIm gonna find you and make you want me", "Night has
