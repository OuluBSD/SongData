I KNOW SOME OF YOU ARE AFRAID TO LISTEN TO THE TRUTH—YOU HAVE BEEN RAISED ON FEAR AND LIES. BUT I AM GOING TO PREACH TO YOU THE TRUTH UNTIL YOU ARE FREE OF THAT FEAR....\n– Malcolm X\nTHE FEARFUL ATTITUDE\nIn the beginning, fear was a basic, simple emotion for the human animal. We confronted something overwhelming—the imminent threat of death in the form of wars, plagues, and natural disasters—and we felt fear. As for any animal, this emotion had a protective function—it allowed us to take notice of a danger and retreat in time. For us humans, it served an additional, positive purpose—we could remember the source of the threat and protect ourselves better the next time. Civilization depended on this ability to foresee and forestall dangers from the environment. Out of fear, we also developed religion and various belief systems to comfort us. Fear is the oldest and strongest emotion known to man, something deeply inscribed in our nervous system and subconscious.\nOver time, however, something strange began to happen. The actual terrors that we faced began to lessen in intensity as we gained increasing control over our environment. But instead of our fears lessening as well, they began to multiply in number. We started to worry about our status in society—whether people liked us, or how we fit into the group. We became anxious for our livelihoods, the future of our families and children, our personal health, and the aging process. Instead of a simple, intense fear of something powerful and real, we developed a kind of generalized anxiety. It was as if the thousands of years of feeling fear in the face of nature could not go away—we had to find something at which to direct our anxiety, no matter how small or improbable.\nIn the evolution of fear, a decisive moment occurred in the nineteenth century when people in advertising and journalism discovered that if they framed their stories and appeals with fear, they could capture our attention. It is an emotion we find hard to resist or control, and so they constantly shifted our focus to new possible sources of anxiety: the latest health scare, the new crime wave, a social faux pas we might be committing, and endless hazards in the environment of which we were not aware. With the increasing sophistication of the media and the visceral quality of the imagery, they have been able to give us the feeling that we are fragile creatures in an environment full of danger—even though we live in a world infinitely safer and more predictable than anything our ancestors knew. With their help, our anxieties have only increased.\nFear is not designed for such a purpose. Its function is to stimulate powerful physical responses, allowing an animal to retreat in time. After the event, it is supposed to go away. An animal that cannot not let go of its fears once the threat is gone will find it hard to eat and sleep. We are the animal that cannot get rid of its fears and when so many of them lay inside of us, these fears tend to color how we view the world. We shift from feeling fear because of some threat, to having a fearful attitude towards life itself. We come to see almost every event in terms of risk. We exaggerate the dangers and our vulnerability. We instantly focus on the adversity that is always possible. We are generally unaware of this phenomenon because we accept it as normal. In times of prosperity, we have the luxury of fretting over things. But in times of trouble, this fearful attitude becomes particularly pernicious. Such moments are when we need to solve problems, deal with reality, and move forward, but fear is a call to retreat and retrench.\nThis is precisely what Franklin Delano Roosevelt confronted when he took office in 1933. The Great Depression that had begun with the stock market crash of 1929 was now at its worst. But what struck Roosevelt was not the actual economic factors but the mood of the public. It seemed to him that people were not only more fearful than necessary but that their fears were making it harder to surmount adversity. In his inaugural address to the country, he said that he would not ignore such obvious realities as the collapse of the economy and that he would not preach a naive optimism. But he implored his listeners to remember that the country had faced worse things in its past, periods such as the Civil War. What had brought us out of such moments was our pioneer spirit, our determination and resolve. This is what it means to be an American.\nFear creates its own self-fulfilling dynamic—as people give in to it, they lose energy and momentum. Their lack of confidence translates into inaction that lowers confidence levels even further, on and on. “So, first of all,” he told the audience, “let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror, which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.”\nWhat Roosevelt sketched out in his speech is the knife’s edge that separates failure from success in life. That edge is your attitude, which has the power to help shape your reality. If you view everything through the lens of fear, then you tend to stay in retreat mode. You can just as easily see a crisis or problem as a challenge, an opportunity to prove your mettle, the chance to strengthen and toughen yourself, or a call to collective action. By seeing it as a challenge, you will have converted this negative into a positive purely by a mental process that will result in positive action as well. And in fact, through his inspiring leadership, FDR was able to help the country shift its mind-set and confront the Depression with a more enterprising spirit.\nToday we seem to face new problems and crises that test our national mettle. But just as FDR made the comparison to even worse times in the past, we can say that what we are facing is not as bad as the perils of the 1930s and the subsequent war years. In fact, the reality of twenty-first-century America is something more like the following: our physical environment is safer and more secure than any other moment in our history. We live in the most prosperous country in the world. In the past only white males could play the power game. Now millions upon millions of minorities and women have been given entrance to the arena, forever altering the dynamic—making us the most socially advanced country in that regard. Advances in technology have opened up all kinds of new opportunities; old business models are dissolving, leaving the field wide open for innovation. It is a time of sweeping change and revolution.\nWe face certain challenges as well. The world has become more competitive; the economy has undeniable vulnerabilities and is in need of reinvention. As in all situations, the determining factor will be our attitude, how we choose to look at this reality. If we give in to the fear, we will give disproportionate attention to the negative and manufacture the very adverse circumstances that we dread. If we go the opposite direction, cultivating a fearless approach to life, attacking everything with boldness and energy, then we will create a much different dynamic.\nUnderstand: we are all too afraid—of offending people, of stirring up conflict, of standing out from the crowd, of taking bold action. For thousands of years our relationship to this emotion has evolved—from a primitive fear of nature, to generalized anxiety about the future, to the fearful attitude that now dominates us. As rational, productive adults we are called upon to finally overcome this downward trend and to evolve beyond our fears.\nTHE FEARLESS TYPE\nTHE VERY FIRST THING I REMEMBER IN MY EARLY CHILDHOOD IS A FLAME, A BLUE FLAME JUMPING OFF A GAS STOVE SOMEBODY LIT.... I WAS THREE YEARS OLD.... I FELT FEAR, REAL FEAR, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. BUT I REMEMBER IT ALSO LIKE SOME KIND OF ADVENTURE, SOME KIND OF WEIRD JOY, TOO. I GUESS THAT EXPERIENCE TOOK ME SOMEPLACE IN MY HEAD I HADN’T BEEN BEFORE. TO SOME FRONTIER, THE EDGE, MAYBE, OF EVERYTHING POSSIBLE ... THE FEAR I HAD WAS ALMOST LIKE AN INVITATION, A CHALLENGE TO GO FORWARD INTO SOMETHING I KNEW NOTHING ABOUT. THAT’S WHERE I THINK MY PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE ... STARTED, WITH THAT MOMENT.... IN MY MIND I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED AND THOUGHT SINCE THEN THAT MY MOTION HAD TO BE FORWARD, AWAY FROM THE HEAT OF THAT FLAME.\n– Miles Davis\nThere are two ways of dealing with fear—one passive, the other active. In the passive mode, we seek to avoid the situation that causes us anxiety. This could translate into postponing any decisions in which we might hurt people’s feelings. It could mean opting for everything to be safe and comfortable in our daily lives, so no amount of messiness can enter. When we are in this mode it is because we feel that we are fragile and would be damaged by an encounter with the thing we dread.\nThe active variety is something most of us have experienced at some point in our lives: the risky or difficult situation that we fear is thrust upon us. It could be a natural disaster, a death of someone close to us, or a reversal in fortune in which we lose something. Often in these moments we find an inner strength that surprises us. What we feared is not so bad. We cannot avoid it and have to find a way to overcome our fear or suffer real consequences. Such moments are oddly therapeutic because finally we are confronting something real—not an imagined fear scenario fed to us by the media. We can let go of this fear. The problem is that such moments tend to not last very long or repeat themselves too often. They can quickly lose their value and we return to the passive, avoidance mode.\nWhen we live in relatively comfortable circumstances, the environment does not press on us with obvious dangers, violence, or limitations to our movement. Our main goal then is to maintain the comfort and security we have, and so we become more sensitive to the slightest risk or threat to the status quo. We find it harder to tolerate feelings of fear because they are more vague and troubling—so we remain in the passive mode.\nThroughout history, however, there are people who have lived in much tighter circumstances, dangers pressing in on them on a daily basis. These types must confront their fears in the active mode again and again and again. This could be growing up in extreme poverty; facing death on the battlefield or leading an army in war; living through tumultuous, revolutionary periods; being a leader in a time of crisis; suffering personal loss or tragedy; or having a brush with death. Countless people grow up in or with such circumstances and their spirit is crushed by adversity. But a few rise above. It is their only positive choice—they must confront these daily fears and overcome them, or submit to the downward pull. They are toughened and hardened to the point of steel.\nUnderstand: no one is born this way. It is unnatural to not feel fear. It is a process that requires challenges and tests. What separates those who go under and those who rise above adversity is the strength of their will and their hunger for power.\nAt some point, this defensive position of overcoming fears converts to an offensive one—a fearless attitude. Such types learn the value not only of being unafraid but also of attacking life with a sense of boldness and urgency and an unconventional approach, creating new models instead of following old ones. They see the great power this brings them and it soon becomes their dominant mind-set.\nWe find these types in all cultures and all time periods—from Socrates and the Stoics to Cornelius Vanderbilt and Abraham Lincoln.\nNapoleon Bonaparte represents a classic fearless type. He began his career in the military just as the French Revolution exploded. At this critical moment in his life, he had to experience one of the most chaotic and terrifying periods in history. He faced endless dangers on the battlefield as a new kind of warfare was emerging, and he navigated through innumerable political intrigues in which one wrong move could lead to the guillotine. He emerged from all of this with a fearless spirit, embracing the chaos of the times and the vast changes going on in the art of war. And in one of his innumerable campaigns, he expressed the words that could serve as the motto for all fearless types.\nIn the spring of 1800 he was preparing to lead an army into Italy. His field marshals warned him that the Alps were not passable at that time of year and told him to wait, even though waiting would spoil the chances for success. The general replied to them, “For Napoleon’s army, there shall be no Alps.” And mounted on a mule, Napoleon proceeded to personally lead his troops through treacherous terrain and past innumerable obstacles. It was the force of one man’s will that brought them through the Alps, catching the enemy completely by surprise and defeating them. There are no Alps and no obstacles that can stand in the way of a person without fears.\nAnother example of the type would have to be the great abolitionist and writer Frederick Douglass, who was born into slavery in Maryland in 1817. As he later wrote, slavery was a system that depended on the creation of deep levels of fear. Douglass continually forced himself in the opposite direction. Despite the threat of severe punishment, he secretly taught himself to read and write. When he was whipped for his rebellious attitude, he fought back and saw that he was whipped less often. Without money or connections, he escaped to the North at the age of twenty. He became a leading abolitionist, touring the North and telling audiences about the evils of slavery. The abolitionists wanted him to stay on his lecture circuit and repeat the same stories over and over, but Douglass wanted to do much more and he once again rebelled. He founded his own antislavery newspaper, an unheard-of act for a former slave. The newspaper went on to have tremendous success.\nAt each stage of his life Douglass was tested by the powerful odds against him. Instead of giving in to the fear—of whippings, being alone on the streets of unfamiliar cities, facing the wrath of the abolitionists—he raised his level of boldness and pushed himself further onto the offensive. This confidence gave him the power to rise above the fierce resistances and animosities of those around him. That is the physics that all fearless types discover at some point—an appropriate ratcheting up of self-belief and energy when facing negative or even impossible circumstances.\nFearless people do not emerge exclusively from poverty or a harsh physical environment. Franklin Delano Roosevelt grew up in a wealthy, privileged family. At the age of thirty-nine he contracted polio, which paralyzed him from the waist down. This was a turning point in his life, as he faced a severe limitation to his movement and possibly an end to his political career. He refused, however, to give in to the fear and the downward pull on his spirit. He went the opposite direction, struggling to make the most of his physical condition and developing an indomitable spirit that would transform him into our most fearless president. For this type of person, any kind of encounter with adversity or limitation, at any age, can serve as the crucible for forging the attitude.\nTHE NEW FEARLESS TYPE\nTHIS PAST, THE NEGRO’S PAST, OF ROPE, FIRE, TORTURE ... DEATH AND HUMILIATION; FEAR BY DAY AND NIGHT, FEAR AS DEEP AS THE MARROW OF THE BONE ... THIS PAST, THIS ENDLESS STRUGGLE TO ACHIEVE AND REVEAL AND CONFIRM A HUMAN IDENTITY ... YET CONTAINS, FOR ALL ITS HORROR, SOMETHING VERY BEAUTIFUL.... PEOPLE WHO CANNOT SUFFER CAN NEVER GROW UP, CAN NEVER DISCOVER WHO THEY ARE....\n– James Baldwin\nThrough much of the nineteenth century, Americans faced all kinds of dangers and adversity—the hostile physical environment of the frontier, sharp political divisions, a lawlessness and chaos that came out of great changes in technology and social mobility. We responded to this constrictive environment by overcoming our fears and developing what came to be known as a pioneer spirit—our sense of adventure and our renowned ability to solve problems.\nWith our growing prosperity this began to change. In the twentieth century, however, one environment remained as harsh as ever—the black ghettos of inner-city America. And out of such a crucible a new fearless type came forward, exemplified by such figures as James Baldwin, Malcolm X, and Muhammad Ali. But the racism of the times constricted their ability to give full rein to this spirit.\nIn recent times, newer types have emerged from inner-city America with more freedom to advance to the highest points of power in America—in entertainment, politics, and business. They come from a Wild West–like environment in which they have learned to fend for themselves and give full rein to their ambition. Their education comes from the streets and their own rough experiences. In a way, they are throwbacks to the freewheeling types of the nineteenth century, who had little formal schooling but created a new way of doing business. Their spirit fits the disorder of the twenty-first century. They are fascinating to watch and in some ways have much to teach us.\nThe rapper known as 50 Cent would have to be considered one of the more dramatic contemporary examples of this phenomenon and this type. He grew up in a particularly violent and tense neighborhood—Southside Queens in the midst of the crack epidemic of the 1980s. And in each phase of his life he has had to face a series of dangers that both tested and toughened him, rituals of initiation into the fearless attitude he has slowly developed.\nOne of the greatest fears that any child has is that of being abandoned, left alone in a terrifying world. It is the source of our most primal nightmares. This was Fifty’s reality. He never knew his father, and his mother was murdered when he was eight years old. He quickly developed the habit of not depending on other people to protect or shelter him. This meant that in every subsequent encounter in life in which he felt fear, he could turn only to himself. If he did not want to feel the emotion, he had to learn to overcome it—on his own.\nHe began hustling on the streets at any early age, and there was no way he could avoid feeling fear. On a daily basis he had to confront violence and aggression. And seeing fear in action so routinely, he understood what a destructive and debilitating emotion it could be. On the streets, showing fear would make people lose respect for you. You would end up being pushed around and more likely to suffer violence because of your desire to avoid it. You had no choice—if you were to have any kind of power as a hustler, you had to overcome this emotion. No one could read it in your eyes. This meant that he would have to place himself again and again in the situations that stimulated anxiety. The first time he faced someone with a gun, he was frightened. The second time, less so. The third time, it meant nothing.\nTesting and proving his courage in this way gave him a feeling of tremendous power. He quickly learned the value of boldness, how he could push others on their heels by feeling supreme confidence in himself. But no matter how tough and hardened they become, hustlers usually face one daunting obstacle—the fear of leaving the streets that are so familiar and that have taught them all of their skills. They become addicted to the lifestyle, and even though they are likely to end up in prison or die an early death, they cannot leave the hustling racket.\nFifty, however, had greater ambitions than to become merely a successful hustler, and so he forced himself to face and overcome this one powerful fear. At the age of twenty and at the peak of his hustling success, he decided to cut his ties to the game and dive into the music racket without any connections or a safety net. Because he had no plan B, because it was either succeed at music or go under, he operated with a frantic, bold energy that got him noticed in the rap world.\nHe was still a very young man when he had faced down some of the worst fears that can afflict a human—abandonment, violence, radical change—and he had emerged stronger and more resilient. But at the age of twenty-four, on the eve of the release of his first record, he came face-to-face with what many of us would consider the ultimate fear—that of death itself. In May of 2000 an assassin poured nine bullets into him in broad daylight as he sat in a car outside his house, one bullet going through his jaw and coming within a millimeter of killing him.\nIn the aftermath of the shooting, Columbia Records dropped him from the label, canceling the release of his first album. He was quickly blackballed from the industry, as record executives were afraid to have any kind of involvement with him and the violence he was associated with. Many of his friends turned against him, perhaps sensing his weakness. He now had no money; he couldn’t really return to hustling after turning his back on it, and his music career seemed to be over. This was one of those turning points that reveals the power of one’s attitude in the face of adversity. It was as if he were confronting the impassable Alps.\nAt this moment, he did as Frederick Douglass did—he decided to ratchet up his anger, energy, and fearlessness. Coming so close to death, he understood how short life could be. He would not waste a second. He would spurn the usual path to success—working within the record industry, nabbing that golden deal, and putting out the music they thought would sell. He would go his own way—launching a mix-tape campaign in which he would sell his music or give it away for free on the streets. In this way he could hone the hard and raw sounds that he felt were more natural to him. He could speak the language of the hood without having to soften it at all.\nSuddenly he felt a great sense of freedom—he could create his own business model, be as unconventional as he desired. He felt like he had nothing to lose, as if the last bits of fear that still remained within him had bled out in the car that day in 2000. The mix-tape campaign made him famous on the streets and caught the attention of Eminem, who quickly signed Fifty to his and Dr. Dre’s label, setting the stage for Fifty’s meteoric rise to the top of the music world in 2003, and the subsequent creation of the business empire he has forged since.\nWe are living through strange, revolutionary times. The old order is crumbling before our eyes on so many levels. And yet in such an unruly moment, our leaders in business and politics cling to the past and the old ways of doing things. They are afraid of change and any kind of disorder.\nThe new fearless types, as represented by Fifty, move in the opposite direction. They find that the chaos of the times suits their temperament. They have grown up being unafraid of experimentation, hustling, and trying new ways of operating. They embrace the advances in technology that make others secretly fearful. They let go of the past and create their own business model. They do not give in to the conservative spirit that haunts corporate America in this radical period. And at the core of their success is a premise, a Law of Power that has been known and used by all the fearless spirits in the past and is the foundation of any kind of success in the world.\nTHE 50TH LAW\nTHE GREATEST FEAR PEOPLE HAVE IS THAT OF BEING THEMSELVES. THEY WANT TO BE 50 CENT OR SOMEONE ELSE. THEY DO WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES EVEN IF IT DOESN’T FIT WHERE AND WHO THEY ARE. BUT YOU GET NOWHERE THAT WAY; YOUR ENERGY IS WEAK AND NO ONE PAYS ATTENTION TO YOU. YOU’RE RUNNING AWAY FROM THE ONE THING THAT YOU OWN—WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT. I LOST THAT FEAR. AND ONCE I FELT THE POWER THAT I HAD BY SHOWING THE WORLD I DIDN’T CARE ABOUT BEING LIKE OTHER PEOPLE, I COULD NEVER GO BACK.\n– 50 Cent\nThe 50th Law is based on the following premise: We humans have generally little control over circumstances. People intersect our lives, doing things directly and indirectly to us, and we spend our days reacting to what they bring. Good things come our way, followed by bad things. We struggle as best we can to gain some control, because being helpless in the face of events makes us unhappy. Sometimes we succeed, but the margin of control that we have over people and circumstance is depressingly narrow.\nThe 50th Law, however, states that there is one thing we can actually control—the mind-set with which we respond to these events around us. And if we are able to overcome our anxieties and forge a fearless attitude towards life, something strange and remarkable can occur—that margin of control over circumstance increases. At its utmost point, we can even create the circumstances themselves, which is the source of the tremendous power that fearless types have had throughout history. And the people who practice the 50th Law in their lives all share certain qualities—supreme boldness, unconventionality, fluidity, and a sense of urgency—that give them this unique ability to shape circumstance.\nA bold act requires a high degree of confidence. People who are the targets of an audacious act, or who witness it, cannot help but believe that such confidence is real and justified. They respond instinctively by backing up, by getting out of the way, or by following the confident person. A bold act can put people on their heels and eliminate obstacles. In this way, it creates its own favorable circumstances.\nWe are social creatures, and so it is natural for us to want to conform to the people around us and the norms of the group. But underneath this is a deep fear—that of sticking out, of following our own path no matter what people think of us. The fearless types are able to conquer this fear. They fascinate us by how far they go with their unconventionality. We secretly admire and respect them for this; we wish we could act more like they do. Normally it is hard to hold our attention; we shift our interest from one spectacle to the next. But those who fearlessly express their difference compel our attention on a deeper level for a longer duration, which translates into power and control.\nMany of us respond to the shifting circumstances of life by trying to micromanage everything in our immediate environment. When something unexpected happens, we become rigid and we respond by employing some tactic that worked in the past. If events change quickly, we are easily overwhelmed and lose control. Those who follow the 50th Law are not afraid of change or chaos; they embrace it by being as fluid as possible. They move with the flow of events and then gently channel them in the direction of their choice, exploiting the moment. Through their mind-set, they convert a negative into a positive .\nHaving a brush with death, or being reminded in a dramatic way of the shortness of our lives, can have a positive, therapeutic effect. Our days are numbered and so it is best to make every moment count, to have a sense of urgency about life. It could end at any moment. The fearless types usually gain such awareness through some traumatic experience. They are energized to make the most of every action, and the momentum this gives them in life helps them determine what happens next.\nIt is all rather simple: when you transgress this fundamental law by bringing your usual fears into any encounter, you narrow your options and your capacity to shape events. Your fear can even bring you into a negative field where your powers are reversed. Being conservative, for instance, can force you into a corner in which you are more likely to lose what you have in the long run because you also lose the capacity to adapt to change. Trying so hard to please people can actually end up pushing them away—it is hard to respect someone who has such an ingratiating attitude. If you are afraid to learn from your mistakes, you will more than likely keep repeating them. When you transgress this law, no amount of education, connections, or technical knowledge can save you. Your fearful attitude encloses you in an invisible prison, and there you will remain.\nObserving the 50th Law creates the opposite dynamic—it opens possibilities, brings freedom of action, and helps create a forward momentum in life.\nThe key to possessing this supreme power is to assume the active mode in dealing with your fears. This means entering the very arenas you normally shy away from: making the very hard decisions you have been avoiding, confronting the people who are playing power games with you, thinking of yourself and what you need instead of pleasing others, making yourself change the direction of your life even though such change is the very thing you dread.\nYou deliberately put yourself in difficult situations and you examine your reactions. In each case, you will notice that your fears were exaggerated and that confronting them has the bracing effect of bringing you closer to reality.\nAt some point you will discover the power of reversal—overcoming the negative of a particular fear leads to a positive quality—self-reliance, patience, supreme self-confidence, and on and on. And once you start on this path, it is hard to turn back. You will continue all the way to a bold and fearless approach to everything.\nUnderstand: you do not have to grow up in Southside Queens or be the target of an assassin to develop the attitude. All of us face challenges, rivals, and setbacks. We choose to ignore or avoid them out of fear. It is not the physical reality of your environment that matters but your mental state, how you come to deal with the adversity that is part of life on every level. Fifty had to confront his fears; you must choose to.\nFinally, your attitude has the power of shaping reality in two opposite directions—one that constricts and corners you in with fear, the other that opens up possibilities and freedom of action. It is the same for the mind-set and spirit that you bring to reading the chapters that follow. If you read them with your ego out in front, feeling that you are being judged here, or are under attack—in other words, if you read them in a defensive mode—then you will needlessly close yourself off from the power this could bring you. We are all human; we are all implicated by our fears; no one is being judged. Similarly, if you read these words as narrow prescriptions for your life, trying to follow them to the letter, then you are constricting their value—their application to your reality.\nInstead you must absorb these words with an open and fearless spirit, letting the ideas get under your skin and affect how you see the world. Do not be afraid to experiment with them. In this way, you will shape this book to your circumstances and gain a similar power over the world.\nIN MY VIEW ... IT IS BETTER TO BE IMPETUOUS THAN CAUTIOUS, BECAUSE FORTUNE IS A WOMAN, AND IF YOU WISH TO DOMINATE HER YOU MUST BEAT HER AND BATTER HER. IT IS CLEAR THAT SHE WILL LET HERSELF BE WON BY MEN WHO ARE IMPETUOUS RATHER THAN BY THOSE WHO STEP CAUTIOUSLY.\n– Niccolò Machiavelli", "I got that animal, animal ambition\nWhy give her love and

People either try to emulate him in some way, or they go in a different direction because they didnt like what he did. But whatever you think of him, he definitely developed his own style: He didnt sound like anyone who came before him.\nMy favorite 2Pac album is The Don Killuminati. It was recorded after he was shot and spent time in prison. It was like a doctor told him he was going to die, and he was trying to get it all down on paper. Thats something the average rapper just could not do: build an entire album around that concept, and stay in that negative space. Everybody knows that theyre going to die. But after youre in a life-threatening situation, you think about it a little more.\n2Pacs aggressive records are my favorite. Hail Mary is just perfect: Picture paragraphs unloaded/Wise words being quoted. Most artists now just arent smart enough to write that, or honest enough to write a line like, I aint a killer but dont push me. These days rappers will just tell you, Ill kill you.\n2Pac was like a camera. Its incredible how much he wrote — how much he documented. To me, Pac was more of a poet than a rapper. You can always tell when youre hearing 2Pac verse. He wrote those lyrics without any music. Notorious B.I.G. was more melody-driven — Im sure he wrote his shit without a pen, and over the music — but Pac was just hashing out his life. The thing was, he was doing that when the public eye was on him, and everything he was hashing out just expanded, and thats when things got out of control.\nAll of us on the East Coast loved 2Pac. The music was all that mattered. That East Coast/West Coast feud was just personal beef. Now that hes not here, hes bigger than ever. I can still listen to two or three 2Pac CDs straight. Sometimes I put on 2Pacs best songs, followed by Biggies best songs. Then I get ready to go into my next project.\nLaurence Fishburne told me once that he didnt like 2Pac. He told me it was because 2Pac was so much smarter than everyone around him. He said he didnt like the way 2Pac behaved because he knew that 2Pac knew better. I understood what he meant. But I still gave him a look like he was bugging.", "This is 50\nI, dont know what you take me for\nI, really dont play that shit\nI, aint got to get you hit\nI get out myself and spray that shit\nI

She cant be out there all the time. \nTOMMY\nLobos? Better not be changing the fucking time again. By the way, Im rethinking this whole tell Lobos we got hit idea of yours.\nJAMES\nIts Kantos. Lets see what he wants. - - Whats up?\nKANTOS\nYou recognize the name Simon stern? Yeah.\nJAMES\nThe cat that owns Parlay, Verbatim, Syrup.\nKANTOS\nYeah, plus, like, five other clubs. Hes one of the biggest nightlife investors in New York. His office called. Stern told the page six to write up about truth. Wants to sit down.\nJAMES\nI got a lot of shit on my plate at the moment. Well talk later.\nKANTOS\nIts a big deal. He only talks to the major guys. Look, with stern behind us, we can open up clubs in Miami and Vegas end of next year.\nJAMES\nIll call you back, man.\nTOMMY\nWhats his problem now? You know what, never mind. We got real shit to do.\nLOBOS\nGhost, Tommy. Good to see you again. You have my money, of course?\nLOBO’S MAN\nUno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis\nLOBOS\n No en voz! ¿Qué eres, un niño de escuela primaria? Pedro. Pedro, por favor, con eso.\nJAMES\nIt’s all there, Todo.\nLOBOS\nTodo. Pedro? ? Si. Now that the business is out of the way, we can eat and enjoy ourselves, eh? How are things? Just fine.\nJAMES\nSomething you need to know. Hmm? We got hit last night.\nLOBOS\nSo I heard. Did you catch this man?\nTOMMY\nWe got him.\nJAMES\nHe knew who to hit, where and when. So until we know how he got his information, were exposed.\nLOBOS\nOh, so he didnt talk?\nTOMMY\nUnfortunately for him.\nLOBOS\nUnfortunately for you. You took your men off the street.\nTOMMY\nHad to.\nJAMES\nNo choice.\nLOBOS\nYoure losing about $25,000 an hour. Its good to see that you knew enough not to let it affect our pay schedule. When I hired you six months ago to be my New York distributor, you guaranteed me a certain level of professionalism. You told me that the Kings, the Bloods, the DDP, that none of them were worth my time. I believe the exact words were, Theyre gangs. And were a business. Hmm? You also told me that only you could guarantee me a safe and secure pipeline - with no interruptions.\nTOMMY\nCome on, Lobos. You know in this business, theres no guarantees.\nJAMES\nWe have a plan to fix this situation.\nLOBOS\nThen you dont have time for lunch. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Anta . Tommy leaves the room and they converse in Spanish].\nTranslation:\nLOBOS\nYou know, I checked out. Your name is feared on the streets.. If you get the situation under control you could have your own Cartel one day. Understand.\nJAMES\nYes.\nLOBOS\nYou live in the country side, take up watercolors while your men take all the risk. You do business two, three days a year. You dont, Ill have to take my business elsewhere. And then, what use will I have for you?\nJAMES\nWe’ll get it done.\nLOBOS\nYes, you will.\nJAME\nGoodbye, boss\nLOBOS\nGoodbye Ghost. Call the pilot, we’re not leaving tonight.\nJAMES\nIll go see Ruiz. You get Anibal and Rolla, deal?\nTOMMY\nYeah.\nJAMES\nSee you tonight. And watch your back.\nTOMMY\nYou too, motherfucker. Full detail, right? Even the trunk?\n?\nEspecially the trunk.\nTOMMY\nGood. I hate the smell of blood.\nANIBAL\nThomas! Where’s ghost?\nTOMMY\nHe sends his regards\nANIBAL\nYou play Dominoes?\nTOMMY\nThis is not a social visit, Anibal. We got hit last night.\nANIBAL\nMy bad, I aint hear that.\nTOMMY\nNot a word?\nANIBAL\nNada.\nTOMMY\nYeah, well, a score like that somebody will brag about. You’ll hear something. Fifty stakes. Seventy-five if you bring him back alive.\nANIBAL\nMeans that much to you? If its one of your men, you can kill him yourself. We just want to watch.\nRUIZ\nIf I knew who ordered it, yeah, theyd be dead already.\nJAMES\nWhat? What?\nRUIZ\nWe got hit too. My money guy, same as yours. They shot my boy, Angel. They shot himin the back of the head. Had a baby on the way.\nJAMES\nThats fucked up.\nRUIZ\nOkay, look. I know, okay, you work with other crews. But we got to dead this.You have to stop this before it goes any further. I could lend you men, extra protection.\nJAMES\nNah, if they know we ride together, I lose trust of the Tainos and Rock Street.\nRUIZ\nCan’t trust them anyway\nJAMES\nTommy and I are neutral. Tu sabes eso, papa. Come on.\nRUIZ\nBueno. Maybe theres something else that we could work out.\nRAINA\nIts the lead, uncle Tommy. If I get it, itll be like a huge deal. Cause Im only in the fifth grade.\nTOMMY\nIm sure you got the best singing voice in the whole place, baby girl.\nRAINA\nWhen are you gonna stop calling me that? Im not the baby anymore. Jasmine is.\nI was there when you were born.\nTOMMY\nYoull always be baby girl to me.\nESTELLE\nTo all of us, baby girl.\nTASHA\nTommy, have some more chicken.\nTOMMY\nMmm, oh. Mmm. Thanks, T.\nTASHA\nYou know, if you meet a girl who can cook, I bet wed never see you again.\n[\nTOMMY\nLaughs] No way thatll ever happen. I gotta come over here and school Tariq in Call of Duty.\nTARIQ\nYeah, right, uncle Tommy.\nJAMES\nYeah, right. ‘Cause you know youre not supposed to be playing those games anyway.\nTOMMY\nOh, my bad.\nRAINA\nStars for my little star. Keep working hard on that audition.\nJAMES\nHey.\nRAINA\nWait, daddy. Are these real diamonds?\nJAMES\n What you think, huh?\nTASHA\nIf you keep this up, youre gonna spoil her rotten.\nJAMES\nAnd you dont complain when I do it to you. Fix me a plate, okay? Tommy and I gonna talk in the office. We got work to do.\nESTELLE\nLet me see them diamonds, baby girl.\nJAMES\nSoldado Nation got hit too.\nTOMMY\nNo shit.\nJAMES\nRuiz got a full shipment of weapons from his Florida connect last week. Our drivers can have full use till the shit blows over or until we catch the motherfucker. He offered to have his people ride with ours.\nTOMMY\nFuck that.\nJAMES\nFuck that. The guns, though, that could work. I know you dont like it. Police stop a driver carrying recreational weight and some cash, Tommy, thats one thing. But a gun in the car, youre looking at intent to distribute, plus the weapons charge. Kanan got what 15 years?\nTOMMY\nYou got a better idea? Cause we gotta open up the store or Lobos will move on. Not to mention our people are off the clock, and our customers will find new places to cop.\nJAMES\nLets say we find the motherfucker. And it is one of Anibals people or Rock Street Killahz or whoever.Then what?\nTOMMY\nThen its on. Then we take down the whole fucking crew. We show them. We show everybody. You cant fuck with us, like the old days before Kanan went inside.\nJAMES\nWe were young then. Mobile. I got too much shit going on now to go into hiding.\nThe kids. The club.\nTOMMY\nOh, wait, so now the club dictates what we do with the real business instead of the other way around? And we opened up the laundromats to clean the money. I was fine with that. But then you said, lets open up a nightclub. So we can hide even more.” So I agreed to hide the money. Period.\nJAMES\nWhat if there could be more than that though, man? What if its our retirement plan?\nTOMMY\nYou mean we grow up, go legit, live happily ever after? Im sor - . Weve been hustling together our whole lives. I love this shit and so do you. Focus up. I say we take Ruiz up on his offer. We put the boys back on the street, and if anyone steps, they light that motherfucker up. Agreed?\nJAMES\nYeah.\nTOMMY\nWell go out and get the guns from Ruiz tonight. Ill set it up. Go without me. Take Julio. I gotta handle a few things at the club. You want a place to clean our money long-term, its gotta stay open, right?\nTOMMY\nNow thats the motherfucking hustler I know talking.\nJAMES\nIll see you at the club later. Im going now. Gotta make sure everythings settled for tonight.\nTASHA\nCant that new white boy do that? You pay him enough.\nJAMES\nIts a business, baby. It needs attention 24/7.\nTASHA\nSo do I. Ghost, whats up? You and Tommy behind closed doors, you running around with this club.\nWe okay?\nJAMES\nWhen we met, whatd you think I was gonna be? Hmm?\nTASHA\nThe biggest goddamn drug dealer in New York City.\nJAMES\nYou never thought about more?\nTASHA\nWhat more? You talking about the club as more? I saw the money you made last night. Thats not more, its less. You are the best at what you do. We have everything. I just want it to stay this way. What?\nJAMES\nWhen you come to the club tonight, you need to look like you own the place, not like you trying to get in for free. Wear that purple dress I got you last month. But, baby, I like this dress. Ill send Shawn back, give you time to change.\nTASHA\nHave you seen my husband?\nGUARD\nAnybody got eyes on the boss? The boss is prepping the DJ now. Ill take you upstairs.\nTASHA\nI know where hell get to me a little sooner. Hey. Mwah.\nJAMES\nWhats up?\nKANTOS\nThe DJ brought backup dancers who are not in the contract.\nJAMES\nWell, we got extra spotlights on hand? We could find them. Have the guys put them up.\nJAMES\n Angie!\nANGELA\nJamie\nJAMES\nAngela Valdes. How long has it been?\nANGELA\nI dont know. Almost, Jesus, 18 years.\nJAMES\nYou look the same.\nANGELA\n Well, thats proof weve gotten older. Your eyesights going.\nJAMES\n My eyes work just fine. What have you been doing?\nANGELA\nFor 18 years? Not sure theres a short answer.\nChoate, college, law school…\nJAMES\nlaw school? Okay, big-time.\nANGELA\nStop it. Im still the same round the way girl I always was.\nJAMES\nSame girl, huh? Not exactly. I dont remember that dress.\nANGELA\nWell, I dont remember that suit either, uptown. What have you been up to, Jamie? What have you been doing all these years?\nGUARD\nBoss, the new DJs gonna start.\nANGELA\nWait, did he just call you boss?\nJAMES\nI own this place.\nGUARD\nKantos said he needs to talk to you now.\nJAMES\nAll right. Um - Sorry, I gotta - You got a nightclub to run.\nANGELA\nI get it. You deserve this crown we got it sewn up because we own it it was good to see you.\nANGELA\nYou too.\nJAMES\nOkay. You know what, give me your number. I ain’t gonna let you get away that easy. I’ll call you.\nANGELA\nOkay\nKANTOS\nMrs. St. Patrick, youre not leaving, are you? The new DJ starts in a few minutes, and Im sure the boss wants you to be here.\nTASHA\nShawn, meet me out front. Im leaving. RUIZ\nQuien es todo?\nPONCHO\nYeah big shipment this time. Esto limpio\nRUIZ\nBueno.\nNOMAR\nWere really giving this away for free?\nRUIZ\nThis time. When we get there, you stay in the car.

Can I go to the movies with Rocio and Lara tomorrow after school Be home by dinner, so I can take you to your moms, okay?\nLILIAN\nAlright\nRUIZ\nNow get inside before you catch a cold\nLILIAN\nOkay, Pa.\nRUIZ\nVamonos. Lets go, were late.JAMES\nJulio tell them to check the guns?\nTOMMY\nFirst thing I said to him. Think it bothers them they dont know who theyre working for?\nJAMES\nYou think the fry cook at burger king knows the fucking CEO? They wouldnt know that motherfucker if he walked in and asked for extra ketchup. Dont forget.\nTOMMY\nOne of these people might be the reason Cruz got jumped in the first place. Yeah, well, lets hope he or she is afraid to get shot.\nJAMES\nWell know soon enough.\nTOMMY\nOur soldiers are strapped now. We should be too. All this shit going on, how am I gonna explain to Tasha I let you run around with no piece?\nJAMES\nLets get em out on the street. Time to make the doughnuts.ANGELA\nNot bad for 18 years later. Greg.\nGREG\nHey, sleepyhead. You missed our run this morning. When you didnt show up and you didnt answer your cell, I thought maybe something was wrong.\nANGELA\nShit. Sorry.\nGREG\nGot here and you were in the shower, so I thought Id grab breakfast.\nANGELA\nGreg, I thought we said the key was just for emergencies. Which this couldve been. This just feels a little - you dont need to check on me.\nGREG\nCome on, Angela, I think most women would be happy to know that someones looking out for them.\nANGELA\nYoure right. Im sorry. You just startled me is all. Thank you.\nGREG\n I gotta go. See you later.JAMES\nAngela Valdes came into the club last night.\nTOMMY\nFrom high school? Wow.

She married now, she got kids?\nJAMES\nNo ring, didnt say nothing about kids.\nTOMMY\nYou tell her about yours?\nJAMES\nWell, we didnt talk that long.\nTOMMY\nOh, shit.\nJAMES\nWhats that supposed to mean?\nTOMMY\nWhat that means is what are you thinking about doing? When that girl moved away, she seriously fucked you up. I was there, remember?\nJAMES\nAw, come on. That was a long time ago.\nTOMMY\nWell, Tashas a good woman, man. You aint never fucked around on her before. Why do you want to go sniffing around pussy from high school?\nJAMES\nTommy, first of all, I cant believe you starting some shit about monogamy. You got more bitches than a goddamn pound, but second, I know me and Tasha got a good thing. Im not trying to fuck that up. Its just got me thinking, you know, about the road not traveled, thats all.\nTOMMY\nThe road not traveled? You are a rich, successful motherfucker. What more do you want?\nJAMES\nI want to see how Angela turned out.\nTOMMY\nNo, you already saw how she turned out. Anything else is just you trying to heal wounds from childhood.\nJAMES\nYou gotta stop watching that Dr. Phil shit.\nTOMMY\nThat man knows what hes talking about.\nJAMES\nShut up.\nTOMMY\nSit down. You shut up.\nJAMES\nNo, shut up. So long, motherfucker.\nTOMMY\nYou didnt ask about that thing we did the other night.\nJAMES\nYou clean it up like I said? Then there aint nothing to ask about.

Ghost keeps you laced. Yo, I dont care. Ill take your hand-me-downs as long as youre giving them out. So this is what happily ever after looks like. You hit the lottery, girl. Niggas aint getting married like that, and certainly not rich niggas.\nTASHA\nHe wasnt rich when I met him. Hmm.

You gotta eat.\nANGELA\nWhere?LOBOS\nAre you sure this is the place?\nJAVIER\nYes, his man said he would be here.\nLOBOS\nYou can’t afford another mistake Javier. As it is, you’re lucky you have another other…Talents. Excuse me. You are Carlos “Vibora” Ruiz\nRUIZ\nFelipe Lobos I thought you were a bedtime story.\nLOBOS\nAren’t you a cliché\nRUIZ\nYou said you are having problems with your current distributors\nLOBOS\nHe is not as reliable as I was led to believe.\nRUIZ\nSo you call Puerto Ricans? You’re the first Mexican I’ve known to do that. Forgive my surprise.\nLOBOS\nI do business with niggers. At least you and I speak the same language. I don’t care who your mother fucked. I want to make money.\nRUIZ\nBueno. Should we make business then?\nLOBOS\nBueno.ANGELA\nNew Yorks so different now. Citi bikes, no cars in Times Square. White people living uptown.\nJAMES\n You been gone a minute.\nANGELA\nMm. You finally got your nightclub. Your dad wouldve been proud.\nJAMES\nI told you about my fathers nightclub? He lost the place before we met. I didnt remember I told you that.\nANGELA\nI think we told each other everything back then.\nJAMES\nHmm.\nANGELA\nThe last time we had lunch, Im pretty sure there was no linen tablecloths.\nJAMES\nI dont think we had chairs.\nJAMES\nWe grabbed a slice at the counter at Rays on Sutphin.\nANGELA\nYou kept refilling your coke. The manager was giving you that evil-ass look. You kept going.\nJAMES\nThe sign said, free refills. I was trying to get you to stay longer.\nANGELA\nI almost missed my train.\nJAMES\nThat was the idea. That was the idea.\nANGELA\nChoate was the opportunity of a lifetime. But that doesnt mean it was easy to go. Jamie, Im sorry. Im sorry I left the way I did.\nANGELA\nYour parents made you go.\nJAMES\nBut I didnt fight them. You said youd be back for Christmas.\nANGELA\nMy family moved to Sunnyside after I left.\nJAMES\nI had the same number. But you were just Gone. And then when my pops died, I thought then, at least, you would reach out.\nANGELA\nI shouldve been there for you. But I just knew that if I called, if I heard your voice, I would go back.\nI wouldve dropped everything for you. Everything my parents worked for, everything Id worked for So I made a choice.\nJAMES\nI wouldnt have asked you to come back. You didnt belong in the hood.\nANGELA\nNeither did you.\nJAMES\nAh.\nANGELA\nBut now were both out, just like we always planned.\nJAMES\nNot exactly how we planned.\nANGELA\nOh, shit.\nJAMES\nWhat?\nANGELA\nI gotta go.\nJAMES\nNow?\nANGELA\nI gotta get back to the office.\nJAMES\nAll right.\nANGELA\nThanks for lunch.\nJAMES\nMm-hmm.\nANGELA\nMmm. Hey…you still remember the Spanish I taught you\nJAMES\nUn poquito. Chinchi\nANGELA\nBye.\nJAMES\nWhen can we do this again?\nANGELA\nIll call you.TOMMY\nDont fill out the total.\nKANTOS\nWhy not?\nTOMMY\nIm gonna confirm your count at the bank. Ill take that.\nKANTOS\nEvery club Ive ever managed, I always do the deposit.\nTOMMY\nTheres a first time for everything. Deposit slip?\nKANTOS\nI already signed it. Want a fresh one?\nTOMMY\nNah, Im sure yours will turn out fine. Look, we hired you for your contacts, not your reputation.\nKANTOS\nHey, about that boss never told me how you found out about that.\nTOMMY\nNone of your fucking business how we know. As long as you work for us, this is how it goes. We dont have a problem, do we?\nKANTOS\nNo, we dont.FRANKIE\n Was just about to send out a search party for you. Youre never late.\nANGELA\nI know. Sorry. Lunch ran long. Frankie, I know you went out on a limb for me. Im not gonna blow it.\nFRANKIE\nIf you do, its both our asses.\nSAXE\nCongrats on the promotion, Valdes.\nANGELA\nThanks, Saxe. Youre on this now?\nGREAG\nJust got assigned. If I request reassignment, theyre gonna ask why.\nFRANKIE\nIm Francesca Lavarro, chief of criminal division along with my deputy, A.U.S.A. Angela Valdes. Ill be leading this task force. Our goal is the prosecution of one of the most notorious drug traffickers in our hemisphere, Mexican national Felipe Lobos. Loboss brutality and vicious nature are well documented. For everyones safety, please remember the task force is top secret. And no one, not even your families, can know the name of the target of this investigation. Agent medina, can you please bring everybody up to speed on Loboss movements in New York this week?\nMEDINA\nLobos landed at Teterboro airport on Tuesday. Once a year, he comes to New York to meet with his banker and his American attorneys. Now, he did make those meetings, but I followed him to a third, to meet this man Carlos Vibora Ruiz. Leader of the due loco set of the Soldado Nation Gang.\nWe learned that, one, Lobos has one single distributor for his product in New York City. Two, hes not entirely happy with his distributor. And three, soldado nation and Ruiz are too low-rent for Lobos.\nTheyre not organized enough to distribute his product. And he was not shy in telling Mr. Ruiz he did not give a fuck!\nANGELA\n We have permission from the Mexican government to detain and prosecute Mr. Lobos if we can build a compelling case against him.\nFRANKIE\nWe cant touch him unless we know we can put him in jail.\nANGELA\nWho can give us the names, places, and dates we need to convict Lobos? His New York distributor. Unfortunately we have no idea who that is. We do have a profile of the type of criminal were looking for. Hes a highly organized individual with an established network in place. He already knows how to move money through the system, is violent enough to control his territory, but still has something to lose something Lobos can threaten to keep him in line. So why is Lobos looking to replace him? What couldve gone wrong? There must be some element out of his control. Whatever the reason, this problem between Lobos and his local guy is exactly what we need to exploit, because the man were looking for is in grave danger from Lobos and from us.\nWe can give him a way out, but only if he decides to take it.\nJAMES\n Tommy, whats up? Im on my way.", "News report\nReporter:\nPolice search for clues on the Q 111 bus where two people were shot, one fatally\nWitness 1:\nYou heard like a few shots ring out and uh, you know by living in the neighborhood familiar with those sounds.

It is how you look at it that matters. Your lack of resources can be an advantage, forcing you to be more inventive with the little that you have. Losing a battle can allow you to frame yourself as the sympathetic underdog. Do not let fears make you wait for a better moment or become conservative. If there are circumstances you cannot control, make the best of them. It is the ultimate alchemy to transform all such negatives into advantages and power.\nHood Alchemy\nIf one is continually surviving the worst that life can bring one eventually ceases to be controlled by a fear of what life can bring. - James Baldwin\nFor well over a year 50 Cent had been working on what was meant to be hist debut album, power of the Dollar, and finally in the spring of 2000 it was ready to be released by Columbia Records. It represented to him all the struggles he had been through on the streets, and he had hopes that it would turn his life around for good. In May of that year, however, a few weeks before the laugh date, a hired assassin shot nine bullets into him while he sat in the back of a car, one bullet going through his jaw and nearly killing him.\nIn a flash, all of the momentum he had built up reversed itself. Columbia canceled the release of the record an dropped Fifty from his contract there was too much violence associated with him; it was bad for business. A few inquiries made it clear that other labels felt the same-he was being blackballed from the industry. One executive told him flatly he would have to wait at least two years before he could think of resurrecting his career.\nThe assassination attempt was the result of an old drug beef from his days as a drug dealer; the killers could not afford to let him survive and would try to finish the job. Fifty had to keep a low profile. At the same time, he had no money and could not return to street hustling. Even many of his friend, who had hoped to be part of his success as a rapper, started to avoid him.\nIn just a few short weeks he had gone from being poised for fame and fortune to hitting the bottom. And there seemed no way to move out of the corner he found himself in. Could this be the end of all his efforts? It would have been better to die that day than to feel this powerlessness. But as he lay in at his grandparents house, recovering from the wounds, he listened a lot to the radio, and what he heard gave him an incredible rush of optimism: an idea started taking shape in his mind that the shooting was in fact a great blessing in disguise, that he had narrowly survived for a reason.\nThe music on the radio was all so packaged and produced. Even the tough stuff, the gangsta rap, was fake. The lyrics did not reflect anything from the streets that he knew. The attempt to pass it off as real and urban angered him to a point he could not endure. this was not the time for him to be afraid and depressed, or to sit around and wait a few years while all of the violence around him died down. He had never been a fake studio gangsta and now he had the nine bullet wounds to prove it. This was the moment to convert all of his anger and dark emotions into a powerful campaign that would shake the very foundations of hip-hop.\nAs a hustler on the streets Fifty had learned a fundamental lesson:", "Why you naggin me?\n Girl you houndin me \n Why you harassin me?\nI dont want alone time, I just wanna fuck\n Why you naggin me?\n Girl you houndin me\n Why you harassin me?\nI dont want alone time, I just wanna fuck\n50 Cent, Yayo, featuring Hope, uh huh\nAs we proceed, uh\n \nYou didnt like the way I wore my hair \nYou didnt like the style a clothes I wear \nYou didnt like the little things I do\nJust tryin to be close to you \nLook I done changed up bitch, I done came up\nMy neck, my wrist, my ears, my fists are all blinged up\nIn the hood they say 50 you a grimy nigga\nWith the rims in that Coupe stay shiny nigga \nWhen you disrespect me is where I draw the line\nYou seen my artwork but you aint seen me draw the nine\nCome through the hood, youll get shot homey just cause I say so\nIm the hottest shit on this street, I dont do J Lo \n \n Why you naggin me?

A decade and a half later, he might need to consider some larger denominations—McKinleys, Clevelands and Madisons, perhaps—to express his wealth.\nDiddy ranks No. 1 on this year’s Forbes Five, our list of hip-hop’s wealthiest artists, with an estimated net worth of $580 million. The bulk of the Bad Boy Records founder’s wealth comes from non-musical ventures, namely his deal with Diageo’s Ciroc. The agreement entitles him to eight-figure annual payouts and a nine-figure windfall if the brand is ever sold—and Ciroc’s value has never been higher.\n“It is one of the fastest-growing brands within vodka,” says Jack Russo, an equity analyst at Edward Jones & Co. “Consumers are feeling a little bit better about their situation, and with that, they’re willing to spend more on premium products.”\nThe No. 2 spot goes to Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter, with a net worth of $475 million. He’s still rolling in cash from megadeals like his $204 million Rocawear sale in 2007 and his $150 million pact with Live Nation the following year. He continues to hold stakes in Roc Nation, Carol’s Daughter, the Brooklyn Nets—and, more significantly, the Barclays Center itself—while adding new partnerships with the likes of Duracell, Budweiser and Bacardi’s D’ussé Cognac.\nAndre “Dr. Dre” Young ranks third with $350 million, thanks mostly to his Beats by Dr. Dre headphones. A year after selling 51% of the company to handset maker HTC for $300 million in August 2011, Dre and his partners bought back half of the half they sold in 2012—and their investment continues to soar in value due to Beats’ whopping 65% market share of the premium headphone market.\nBryan “Birdman” Williams owns the No. 4 spot, riding his Cash Money/Young Money empire to a fortune of $150 million. His roster includes Drake, Nicki Minaj and Lil Wayne . Birdman also recently launched a YMCMB clothing line and a spirit called GT Vodka.\n“We have to build different brands,” he told FORBES last month. “That’s what it’s all about.”\nRounding out the list is Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson at $125 million. He’s another master of brand building: The bulk of his fortune came from heavy sales of his music, merchandise, video games and books in the wake of his smash debut Get Rich or Die Tryin’—and particularly from his payout for the sale of his stake in VitaminWater parent Glacéau to Coca-Cola in 2007.\nNow he’s trying to replicate that feat with companies like SMS Audio, his answer to Dr. Dre’s Beats, and SK Energy, which has its sights set on category leader 5-Hour Energy. When informed that his net worth would be estimated at a little over $100 million this year, 50 Cent said simply, “That’s cool.” After being asked to elaborate, though, he changed his tune slightly.\n“Oh, you want me to tell you an exact number?” he said with a grin. “I’ve got way more.”\nIf his new ventures continue to grow, 50 Cent’s number on this list should begin to reflect that belief as soon as next year.\nAs for Diddy, he may need to stick to Benjamins after all. According to a recent tally, there were only 165,372 $1,000 bills still in use—not even enough to cover one-third of Diddy’s fortune.", "First & Foremost I would like to thank God for my blessings.

That’s the goal in life, that’s what I live for.”\nDiddy is the closest to becoming a billionaire, leading the pack with a net worth of $550 million. The Bad Boy Records founder has remained a mainstream mainstay for 15 years thanks to his knack for self-promotion. Lately, he’s been channeling that energy toward Diageo-backed Ciroc vodka, much to the benefit of his bank account: he receives double-digit millions annually as a share of profits. Sales of the spirit spiked 122% last year in the wake of strong demand for new flavor Ciroc Peach; he is entitled to a nine-figure chunk of cash if the brand is ever sold.\nDiddy also boasts stakes in clothing lines Sean John and Enyce, marketing firm Blue Flame, record label Bad Boy and a handful of tech startups. But it’s his deal with Comcast to launch cable channel Revolt in 2013 that could push him into billionaire territory. He’ll own the channel outright, and based on projected viewership totals, its value could soar into the low-to-mid nine figures within the next few years.\nNext up is Jay-Z at $460 million. Unlike his fellow Forbes Five members, Jay-Z still churns out music and goes on tour—most recently with pal Kanye West—adding to his considerable war chest. He sold his Rocawear clothing label for $204 million in 2007 and signed 10-year $150 million deal with Live Nation in 2008, and also holds stakes in the New Jersey Nets, his 40/40 Club chain, ad firm Translation, cosmetics company Carol’s Daughter and other businesses.", "What the fuck is the matter with this nigga man?

Capitol is one of the many labels that are part of Universal Music Group.\n50 Cent launched an ultra-successful, six-times platinum debut with Get Rich or Die Tryin in 2003, when he burst on the music scene with Eminem as his mentor. His sophomore album, 2005s The Massacre was almost as successful, but other albums didnt match his previous efforts and he expressed his unhappiness with his label. 50 Cent had been planning to release a fifth album on the label, but it was set with multiple release dates and singles, and eventfully didnt see a release.\nHis last album was 2009s Before I Self Destruct, which also had several release dates.\nI have had great success to date with Shady/Aftermath/Interscope and Id like to thank Eminem and Dr. Dre for giving me an incredible opportunity, 50 Cent said in a statement. Ive learned so much from them through the years. I am excited to enter this new era where I can carry out my creative vision.\n50 Cent had a plethora of hits early in his career that dominated the pop, rap and R&B charts, from P.I.M.P. to Candy Shop to the anthemic In da Club, which introduced the young rapper aside Dr. Dre and Eminem.\nBoth myself and Shady Records are grateful to have had the chance to play a part in 50s career, Eminem said in a statement. Shady simply would not be what it is without 50 Cent. Ive developed a great friendship with 50 over the years, and thats not going to change. We know 50 will have success in his new situation, and we remain supporters of both him and G-Unit.\nThe rapper, born Curtis Jackson, has also been a success outside of music, from film roles to fashion to books.\n50 Cents new album, Animal Ambition, will be released June 3.
