began the dissection of 14-year-old Baby Grace Blue. The arms of the victim were pin-cushioned with 16 hypodermic needles, pumping in four major preservatives, colouring agents, memory information transport fluids and some kind of green stuff. From the last and 17th, all blood and liquid was extracted. The stomach areas was carefully flapped open and the intestines removed, disentangled and re-knitted as it were, into a small net or web and hung between the pillars of the murder-location, the grand damp doorway of Oxford Town Museum of Modern Parts, New Jersey. The Limbs of Baby were then served from the torso. Each limb was implanted with a small, highly sophisticated, binary code translator which in turn was connected to small speakers attached to far ends of each limb. The self-contained mini amplifiers were then activated, amplifying the decoded memory info-transport substances, revealing themselves as little clue haikus, small verses detailing memories of other brutal acts, well documented by the ROMbloids. The limbs and their components were then hung upon the splayed web, slug-like prey of some unimaginable creature. The torso, by means of its bottom-most orifice, had been placed on a small support fastened to a marble base. It was shown to warring degrees of success depending upon where one stood from behind the web but in front of the Museum door itself, acting as both signifier and guardian to the act. It was definitely murder - but was it art?\nAll this was to be the lead-up to the most provocative event in the whole sequence of serial-events that had started around November of that same year, plunging me into the most portentous chaos-abyss that a quiet lone hacker like myself could comprehend. My name is Nathan Adler, or Detective Professor Adler in my circuit. Im attached to the division of Art-Crime Inc., the recently instigated corporation funded by an endowment from the Arts Protectorate of London, it being felt that the investigation of art-crimes was in itself inseparable from other forms of expression and therefore worthy of support from this significant body. Nicolas Serota himself had deemed us, the small-fry of the division, worthy of an exhibit at last years Biennale in Venice, three rooms of evidence and comparative study work which conclusively proved that the cow in Mark Tanseys The Innocent Bye Test could not differentiate between Paulus Potters The Young Bull of 1647 and one of Monets grain stack paintings of the 1890s. The traditional art press deemed this extrapolation bullshit and removed itself to study the more formal ideas contained in Damien Hirsts Sheep In A Box. Arts a farmyard. Its my job to pick thru the manure heap looking for peppercorns.\nfriday, december 31, 1999, 10.15 am\nAs in any crime, my first position is to pursue the motive-gag. The recent spate, thru 98-99, of concept-muggings pretty much had me pulling breath for an art-murder. It was a crime whose time was now. The precedents were all there. It had probably its beginnings in the 70s with the Viennese castrationists and the blood-rituals of Nitsch. Public revulsion put the lid on that episode, but you cant keep a good down. Spurred on by Chris Burdens having himself shot by his collaborator in a gallery, tied up in a bag, thrown on a highway and then crucified upon the top of a Volkswagen, stories circulated thru the nasty-neon of N.Y. night that a young Korean artist was the self-declared patient of wee-hours surgery in cut and run operations at not-so-secret locations in the city. If you found out about it, you could go and watch this guy having bits and pieces removed under anaesthetic. A finger-joint one night, a limb another. By the dawning of the 80s, rumour had it that he was down to a torso and one arm. Hed asked to be left in a cave in the Catskills, fed every so often by his acolytes. He didnt do much after that. I guess he read a lot. Maybe wrote a whole bunch. I suppose you can never tell what an artist will do once hes peaked. Round this same time, Bowie the singer remarked on a copula goons who frequented the Berlin bars wearing full surgery regalia; caps, aprons, rubber gloves and masks. The cutting edge. Then came Damien Hirst with the Shark-Cow-Sheep thing. No humans, palatable ritual for the world-wide public. The acceptable face of gore. Meanwhile in the US, 1994, I was in town on the night of the Athey sacrifactions.\nthursday, october 27, 1994\n122 east village, manhattan\nRon Athey, performance artist not for the squeamish - former heroin addict-HIV positive, pushes what looks like a knitting needle repeatedly into his forehead, a crown of blood, must hurt like hell. Stream red dribble-dribble. No screams. Face moves in pain. Carried upstage and scrubbed down in his own blood. The water. Now dresses in nice suit and tie. Now in black T-shirt and jean, carving, with a disposable scalpel, patterns, into the back of Darryl Carlton, a black man.\nBloody blotted paper towels then hung on a washing line suspended over the heads of the audience Blood-prints from life. An extremely limited edition. When it was first performed back in March. Four Scenes In A Harsh Life exploited controversy shrapnel throughout the National Endowment For the Arts. We have taken every precaution with our disposal systems, an Athey spokesperson said. The towels containing the blood are immediately deposited in hazardous-waste bags. Each evening, the material will be driven to a hospital for final disposal. Athey says he is dealing with issues of self-loathing, suffering, healing and redemption.\nfriday, december 31, 1999, 10.30 am\nmuseum of modern parts\nIm drinking up the Oxford Town, New Jersey fume. Salty and acid. Maybe I can get a handle on this thing back in Soho at the bureau. It used to be Rothkos studio, now the playground for all us Art-Crime folk, AC or the daubers as were dubbed. Rothko himself, in a dark-deep-drunk one night, carefully removed his clothes, folded them up neatly, placing them upon a chair, lay upon the floor in a crucified position and after several attempts, found the soft blue pump of wrists and checked out. Hed held the razor blades between wads of tissue paper so that he wouldnt cut his fingers. Deep thinker. Always was.\n11.00 am dauber hq, soho\nThe only names the Data bank can associate with Baby Grace are Leon Blank, Ramona A.

I cant sleep for the screaming of some poor ostracized Turkish immigrant screaming his guts out from over the street. His hawking shriek sounds semi-stifled like hes got a pillow over his mouth. But the desperation comes through the spongy rubber like a knife. It cuts the breeze and bangs my eardrums. I take a walk past the fabric machine, turn left onto a street with no name, The caucasian suicide centre, naked and grimy, silhouetted by fungus yellow street lamps female slashing way-out saints for a dollar a time thrown downstairs if you cant take any more. Pure joy of retreat into death, led by the shepherdess. Anti mixed-race posters pasted upon their alter of pop-death icons party people. A zero with no name looks dull-eyed to Ms. Stone, the drone that says in the future, everything was up to itself. Yes. I remember Ramona. She set herself up as the no-future priestess of the Caucasian Suicide Temple, vomiting out her doctrine of death-as-eternal- party into the empty vessels of Berlin youth. The top floor rooms were the gateways to giving up to the holy ghost. She must have overseen more than 30 or 40 check-outs before the local squad twigged what was going down.\noctober\n28, 1994\nNew Yorker Magazine, advanced copy, celebrating fashion. Its a first of its kind since Tina Brown took over as editor. One look is all it took. It took the look and wrote a new book on what sophistaplites would take and bake. Guy Bourdin featured heavily in this new eDISHion. Since the advent of AIDS and the new morality, and, of course, his death, his dark sexy fatal style had fallen out of Vogue. An uncompromising photographer, he had found a twisty avenue through desire and death. A white female leg sticking gloomily out of a bath of black liquid enamel. Two glued up babes covered in tiny pearls. The glue prevented their skins from breathing and they pass out. Oh it would be beautiful. he is to have said. to photograph them dead in bed. He was a French Guy. Ha had known Man Ray. Loved Lewis Carroll.\nHis first gig was doing hats for Vogue. Hed place dead flies or bees on the faces of the models, or, female head wears hat crushed between three skinned calves heads, tongues lolling. Well, it was the 50s, that was it was. The tight-collor 50s seen through unspeakable hostility. He wanted but he couldnt paint. So he threw globs of revengeful hatred at his mobile subjects. He would systematically pull the phone cord out of the wall. He was never to be disturbed. Disturbed. Never. Everything and everyone died around him. One shoot focusing upon a women lying in bed was said to be a reconstruction of his estranged wifes death. Another picture has a women in a phone booth making some frantic call. Her hand is pressed whitely against the glass. Behind her and outside are two female bodies partially covered by the autumn leaves. His dream, so he told his friends, was to do shoots in the morgue, with the stiffs as mannequins, I dont know. I just read this stuff. Now his spirit was being resurrected. Were mystified by blood. Its our enemy now. We dont understand it.\nCant live with it. Cant , well... yknow?\nfriday, december 31, 1999, 11.30 am\nAfter Surgery and investment in a bullet-proof mask, Ramona turned up in London, Canada as owner of a string of body-parts jewellery stores. Lamb penis necklaces, goat-scrotum purses, nipple earrings, that sort of thing. The word on the street, however, suggested that it was not in the best of interests to become one of her clients as occasionally, a customer would step into her shop and not come out again. The whistle blew after a much-loved and highly respected celebrity, known for being known, failed to show for a gallery-hanging of her mirrors. Other celebrities, equally known for being known, some only to each other, thought it was the most profound exhibit in years and couldnt take their eyes off the works. All the pieces sold within an hour, many for record prices. When the critic for Date magazine asked for an interview with the celebrity-artist, the gallery owner recalled that he hadnt seen her since earlier that day. Shed mentioned that she would be going shopping for a diamond-encrusted umbilical cord as a celebratory thing to announce her pregnancy. She would be back in an hour. Just a quick stop at the Gallstone. 1986. That pregnancy would have produced a being that would be around 14 years of age.\nIf it was still alive.\nTo be continued...?", "Ive seen the city\nI took the next flight\nFor Borneo\nThey say its

We are looking through\nthe crown at the girl as she rises slowly, then looks boldly\nat the PRINCE.]\nGIRL: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord.\nFor though my father, the Duke, has promised you my hand, I cannot\nconsent to be yours until the evil that stalks our land from highest\nhill to deepest dale is ...\n[Suddenly the GIRL stops speaking, a look of stunned confusion on her\nface.]\nGIRL: ... from highest hill to deepest dale ... her brow furrows in\nconcentration and then Damn!\n[She burrows one hand into the deep sleeve of her gown and pulls out a\nrolled-up soft-cover book. She rifles through the pages.]\n[The PRINCE is not a prince at all, but a SHEEPDOG wearing a tin foil\ncrown. He thinks his work is over and its time to play and he lunges\nhappily towards the GIRL who isnt a princess or even a duchess, but\n15-year-old SARAH.]\n[SARAH is knocked over by the playful DOG. Beneath the gown which we can now see\nis homemade and not very grand at all, we see faded jeans\nand running shoes.]\nSARAH: Get off me, you monster!!\n[The DOG grabs the book out of her hand and runs away with it, hoping\nto be chased. SARAH doesnt follow, she just sits up and pulls the\ngrass out of her tangled hair and sighs with frustration. The DOG\ncomes back over to SARAH, its tail wagging hopefully.]\nSARAH: If you value your mangy life, Merlin, youll hand it over.\nTHE BOOK\n[On the cover it says, MEANDERS QUEEN a play in three acts by Robin\nZakar_. SARAH reaches for it and we hear a clock tower begin to chime.]\nSARAH leaps to her feet.\nSARAH: Oh no, Merlin! Were really late! Why does everything have to\nhappen to me!!!?\n[MERLIN prances around her happily, his foil crown in his mouth. SARAH\npulls it out of his mouth and throws it in a nearby trash basket. He\nrushes after it and peers into the basket, wanting to fetch.]\nSARAH: Its all your fault, you miserable mutt!!\nShe hikes up her dress and runs into the trees. MERLIN whimpers and\nEXT: THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TREES - DAY\n[SARAH comes bursting through the trees and runs down a hill toward\nthe street. WE PULL BACK and WE CAN SEE an enormous steel mill on the\nother side of the river. And now WE NOTICE that the light isnt pink\nany more but sort of dull and hazy, and the idyllic glade is barely a\nsuburban park, and this is just an ordinary day in a very ordinary\nplace.]\nEXT: AN OLD RAMBLING HOUSE - DUSK\n[SARAH runs up a path to an older, rambling house. She goes through\nthe front door, MERLIN hot on her heels, and neither one of them sees\nthe beautiful SNOW-WHITE BIRD that lands in a tree beside the path.]\nINT: INSIDE THE ROUSE - EVENING\n[SARAH bursts through the front door and makes a beeline for the\nstairs. She almost makes it. SARAHS MOTHER appears in the hallway.]\nMOTHER: Sarah, where have you been?!!!\n[SARAH abruptly stops and changes to an elegantly graceful ascension\nof the stairs.]\nSARAH in an affected voice: I cant talk to you now. Im in\nrehearsal.\nMOTHER: You were supposed to be home an hour ago to baby-sit for\nFreddie! Dont we at least deserve an explanation?\n[SARAH stops and leans over the railing. She speaks with a\nmelodramatic solemnity.]\nSARAH: As Meanders Queen, Ive been ... meandering. Dither me not\nabout explanations.\n[With that she turns and heads for her room. On the door is a sign\nthat says: Admittance by Invitation Only. SARAHS FATHER comes into\nthe hall.]\nFATHER: Whats that all about?\nMOTHER: Its a part in a play, raising her voice but thats no\nreason to...\nSARAH turns in her doorway. She calls down.\nSARAH: Chasten not your Queen, Peasant!\nINT: SARAHS ROOM - NIGHT\nFATHER : Sarah, thats no way to talk to your mother!\nSARAH mumbles to herself: Shes not my mother.\n[SARAH takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. She can hear footsteps\nand SOMEONE comes to the other side of the door.]\nWith a practiced gesture SARAH removes her jeans while leaving her\ngown in place.]\nSTEPMOTHER : Sarah, when I tell you to be home at five, I\nexpect you to be home at five.\n[SARAH quickly shifts to her STEPMOTHERs attitude -- hands on hips,\nand silently mimes her words.]\nSARAH: Yes, Madame!\nINT: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY\nSTEPMOTHER: And dont Yes Madame me!\nFATHER: Is she all right?\nSTEPMOTHER frustrated: Of course shes all right! I left the\nBernsteins number on the kitchen table ... Freddie might be coming\ndown with a cold so call us if he seems even the least bit\nuncomfortable ...\nSARAH sighs: Yes, Mother.\nSTEPMOTHER: Oh! I give up!\nFATHER: Well see you later, baby. And remember ...\nINT: SARAHS ROOM - NIGHT\nSARAH & FATHER : Dont open the door to strangers.\n[We hear him leave. SARAH waits a beat and then turns and opens her\nbedroom door.]\nSARAH: And dont call me baby! she slams the door shut; mimicking\nher parents Precious little Freddie might be coming down with a cold\n...\n[She sighs and looks around. This is really her world, her retreat,\nand she knows and controls every inch of it. The shelves are filled\nwith an orderly array of childhood dolls and toys. The books are\nlined up neatly in the bookcase and if we could see them up close we\nwould see that they were placed in alphabetical order -- and\naccording to the year they were acquired. She walks over to her\ndresser. She checks herself out in the mirror above the chest of\ndrawers and adjusts the golden circlet which has been knocked askew\nby her run. She then stops for a moment and looks at the photographs\non the dresser. One of her FATHER, her MOTHER and herself as a LITTLE\nGIRL. Another picture of her MOTHER in a newspaper clipping is taped\nto the mirror. The headline says, Linda Williams a Smash in New\nPlay. A cover of a Playbill is also tacked on to the mirror. It says\n_Best of Both Worlds_ starring Linda Williams. SARAH then reverently\nopens a music box -- the kind with a twirling dancer inside -- and to\nthe strains of an unbearably tinny version of Greensleeves she\nbegins to rehearse.]\nSARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my Lord\n...\nSARAH : Someone has been in my room!\n[Through the mirror WE SEE what she sees: an empty space on one of the\nshelves. She swirls around and rushes out the door.]\nINT: THE HALLWAY - NIGHT\nSARAH: Wheres Lancelot?\nSARAH: Wheres my bear?!!\nINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\nSARAH enters FREDDIEs room. She searches the nursery.\nSARAH: Nobody listens to a thing I say.\nSARAH: How many times have I told them to stay out of my room ...\n[She gets to the crib and looks down. FREDDIE is wide awake, gurgling\nat Lancelot, SARAHs tattered old teddy bear.]\nSARAH: And you, you can just give me back my bear!\n[She yanks it out of the crib and leaves. FREDDIE looks hurt and his\nface starts to cloud up.]\nINT: SARAH S ROOM - NIGHT\n[SARAH is curled up on her bed, cuddling her bear. MERLIN sits beside\nher. She looks at the DOG.]\nSARAH: Youre the only one who understands me, Merlin.\n[He licks her face. She gets up and holds the bear out in front of her.\nSARAH: Do not be swayed by my pleasure at the sight of you, my lord\n...\nSARAH: Go to sleep, Freddie!\nSARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?\nINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\nSARAH: I dont need this.\nSARAH: There, isnt that nice ...\n[But FREDDIE doesnt think so. He pushes the blanket off and howls\neven louder. SARAH sees one of his toys on the floor and picks it up\nand gives it to him. She speaks through gritted teeth.]\nSARAH: Want your nice toy?\n[But FREDDIE doesnt. He flings the toy across the room. SARAH bends\nover the crib and speaks softly.]\nSARAH: You know, Freddie, I heard that the only thing to do with a\nbaby who wont stop crying is to get some goblins to come over and\nteach him a lesson ...\nSARAH: How would you like that, kid? A nasty evil goblin ...\n[FREDDIE is quiet for a moment, almost as if he is considering. Then\nhe really howls. SARAH sighs and picks him up. She begins to pace\nback and forth, and starts to hum. FREDDIE goes back to a mere\nwhimper.]\nSARAH: Oh, you like that, do you?\n[She begins to hum even louder and more melodically as she places the\nBABY back into the crib. She then begins one of the moat macabre\nlullabies you could ever imagine. She sings of how scary the dark is,\nhow the shadows on the wall like to eat you when youre small and\nhow a baby doesnt stand a chance when the Goblins start their\ndance. She throws herself into her performance; adding to it a wild\ndance that has her whirling around the room, leaping into the air,\nmaking strange shadows on the wall. Finally, the dance ends when too\nmany crazed pirouettes result in her stumbling against FREDDIEs\ndresser. She staggers a bit and then the lights blink as a crack of\nthunder is heard, followed by a flash of lightning.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[Little FREDDIE is wailing. He hasnt understood a thing that SARAH\nhas sung but he can sense that something is wrong.]\nSARAH: Ah, cmon, Freddie. It was just a song.\n[They are interrupted by the sound of the doorbell. SARAH reacts with\na gasp of surprise. FREDDIE, for some inexplicable reason, is\nsuddenly quiet.]\nINT: FOYER - NIGHT\n[SARAH approaches the front door with some trepidation. She starts to\nopen it, then realizes what she is doing. She fastens the chain and\nonly then opens the door.]\nEXT: HOUSE - NIGHT\nSARAHS POV\n[Through the door opening SARAH can see a very elegantly dressed,\nquite good-looking MAN of an indeterminate age. He has a worldly air,\nor is it other-worldly? Before he can speak a flash of lightning\nilluminates his face. He is a mesmerizing sight and SARAH cant help\nbut gawk.]\nMAN: Excuse me, is this the home of Sarah Williams ... Sarah\nWilliams, the actress?\nSARAH: Thats me.\nMAN: Allow me to introduce myself ... Im\nRobin Zaker.\nSARAH: You wrote the play!\nSARAH: Just a second.\nINT: FOYER - NIGHT\n[SARAHs hand hesitates over the chain for just a moment, and then she\nunfastens it and opens the door. ZAKAR enters and extends his hand.]\nZAKAR: It is an honour, Miss Williams. I understand you make a\ndelightful Queen Meander.\nSARAH: Well, weve just started rehearsal, but how did you know?\nZAKAR: I was passing through this part of the country and heard that\nit was going to be done here. This is the first amateur production of\nthe play, which of course is delightful for me.\nSARAH: You know we were supposed to open tonight, but we got delayed.\nThe firemen had to use the hall.\nZAKAR: Yes, I know, thats why I wanted to stop by to see you.\n[They are interrupted by a particularly loud crash from upstairs. And\nthen FREDDIE begins to howl.]\nSARAH: Thats my brother ...\nSARAH: Ill be right back!\n[ZAKAR watches her run up the stairs. He glances around and then walks\nright to the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle.]\nINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\n[FREDDIE in standing in his crib crying his eyes out. SARAH rushes in\nand sees that the storm has blown open the basement window and it is\ncrashing against the wall. She rushes to close it. FREDDIEs screams\nare piteous.]\nSARAH: Oh, Freddie ...\n[There is more thunder, and then lightning flashes across the darkened\nroom.]\nZAKAR : Perhaps I can soothe him ...\n[SARAH gasps and whirls around. ZAKAR is framed in the doorway. He has\na drink in his hand. SARAH holds the BABY close.]\nSARAH: You shouldnt be up here!\nZAKAR : I just wanted to help ...\nSARAH rushes by him, still clutching the BABY.\nINT: HALLWAY - NIGHT\n[SARAH comes out of the nursery and hurries down the stairs. ZAKAR\nfollows. FREDDIE is still crying.]\nSARAH: Maybe youd better leave ...\n[She gets to the bottom of the stairs. FREDDIE whimpers. ZAKAR is\nmaking her very nervous.]\nSARAH: ... I, uh, dont think I care to talk to you about the play.\nZAKAR: Neither do I.\nSARAH: What!\nZAKAR: Im more concerned about the baby, of course.\nSARAH: Freddies just fine.\n[But he isnt. Hes still crying. ZAKAR reaches into his pocket and\npulls out a coin. Be runs it over his fingers right in front of\nFREDDIEs face. The BABY stops crying.]\nZAKAR: There, isnt that better?\nSARAH : Uh, sure ... but you really have to leave ...\nZAKAR: Im not just a playwright, as you can see ... bring him in\nhere and Ill do some other tricks for him ...\nSARAH: No! Youve got to ...\n[But he is already in the living room. She follows, still holding the\nBABY.]\nINT: LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n[ZAKAR is sitting on the sofa, looking very comfortable. SARAH stands\nin the doorway, not sure what to do. Reluctantly, she goes and sits\ndown across from him.]\nZAKAR: Now watch this, Freddie ...\n[He reaches into his breast pocket and tugs on the handkerchief there.\nIt comes out followed by many others, all different colours. SARAH\nrolls her eyes. This is not that exciting a trick. FREDDIE isnt\nimpressed, either. In fact he starts to cry again.]\nZAKAR: So youre going to be like that, are you, Freddie? Well, you\nknow what that means?\nZAKAR: Its time to call the goblins!\nSARAH: What?!!\n[SARAH is surprised to hear this, to say the least. It echoes her\nsilly threat to FREDDIE earlier.]\nZAKAR: Yes. Thats what we do with bad babies ... we send for the\ngoblins!!\n[And with that he reaches into yet another pocket and pulls out a\npoorly made, very silly-looking goblin hand puppet. SARAH laughs\nwith relief. ZAKAR, his hand in the puppet, talks in a high-pitched,\nunconvincing goblin voice.]\nZAKAR: You like goblins, dontcha, Freddie? but I bet\nyour sister doesnt ...\n[SARAH rolls her eyes at this, and then gasps. Because for one very\nstrange moment, the puppet keeps bouncing, but both of ZAKARs hands\nare visible! And then the puppet seems to move away from the table,\nand disappear! FREDDIE claps his hands with delight. SARAH jumps out\nof her chair.]\nSARAH: Where is it?!!!\nZAKAR: Its in there.\nSARAH: Impossible!\nZAKAR: See for yourself.\n[SARAH hesitates for a moment, and then places FREDDIE carefully on\nthe rug. She then marches over to the cabinet and throws open the\ndoor.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH gasps and involuntarily slams the door. She whirls around to\nface ZAKAR.]\nSARAH: How did you do that?!!\nZAKAR: Magic.\nSARAH: Oh sure ...\n[She nods, skeptically. She cant see -- but WE CAN DEFINITELY SEE --\nthe cabinet door slowly open behind her, and out of it comes a tiny,\nfierce-looking GOBLIN! This is not a puppet, but a living creature\nthat moves quickly out of sight with an exaggerated tiptoe. SARAH is\nbusy with another problem. She doesnt see FREDDIE!]\nSARAH: Wheres Freddie?!!\n[ZAKAR shrugs. In a panic, SARAH begins to look around this room. She\ncalls for FREDDIE and, as she passes in front of the living room\ndoorway, WE CAN SEE something scurry across the hallway. SARAH stops\nand listens.]\nSARAH: Freddie?\n[But it wasnt a BABY she heard. Behind her there is more scurrying as\nCREATURES begin to appear from various parts of the room. We hear\nfaint snickering. She turns to ZAKAR, terrified.]\nSARAH: Where is he?!!\nZAKAR points to the chair SARAH was sitting in. She is behind the\nchair and cant see anything. But when she comes around in front of\nit she sees FREDDIE comfortably ensconced in the cushions. And hes\nplaying with the goblin puppet! SARAH reaches over and grabs the\npuppet out of his hands. She flings it across the room and scoops up\nthe BABY.]\nSARAH: Who are you?!!!\nZAKAR throws back his head and laughs, then suddenly leaps off the\nsofa and lands very close to her.]\nZAKAR: Ive been known by many names ... but the one I prefer is\nJareth, King of the Goblins!!!\nSARAH: I dont believe this!\n[Amidst thunder and lightning JARETH flings his arms up into the air,\nand he is suddenly dressed in strange, medieval garb, a cloak\nswirling around him. And whats worse, much, much worse, is that\nsuddenly GOBLINS are everywhere! Popping out of drawers, from under\nchairs, swinging off the chandeliers. SARAH turns and runs out of the\nroom.]\nINT: FOYER - NIGHT\n[Its worse in here! The GOBLINS are pouring down the stairs, SOME\nslide down the bannister! SARAH tries running into another room, but\nis soon back, followed by a DOZEN MORE! She barely makes it to the\nfront door and struggles to open it with the BABY in her arms. The\nGOBLINS pull her back and laugh wildly. They fling her right into\nJARETHs arms. He scoops FREDDIE up and whirls away from her. SARAH\ntries to grab the BABY back but the GOBLINS get between them.]\nSARAH : Give him back, you monster! Give him back!\n[JARETH only laughs and starts to swirl gracefully. FREDDIE laughs\nwith delight and SARAH struggles to reach him. With a superhuman\neffort she pushes through the MASS OF CREATURES and grabs onto\nJARETHs fluttering cloak. Its like being caught up in a whirlwind\nof incredible force.]\nSARAH : I ... wont ... let ... you ... take ... him!\n[But its too late. SARAHs feet leave the ground and she is pulled\nwith them and the whole MASS OF GOBLINS. JARETH and FREDDIE swirl up\nthrough where the ceiling would have been, up into the blackness.\nTheres a QUICK MONTAGE OF SHOTS: JARETHs laughing face; SARAH,\ndesperate as her fingers are losing their grip; FREDDIE, whos having\na great time; GOBLINS, ALL gleeful; then -- JARETHs garment pulls\nout of SARAHs grip. She falls OUT OF FRAME, a silent scream on her\nface.]\nEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY\nA WIDE PEACEFUL SHOT\n[The sky is pink, and the WHITE BIRD swoops by us as WE TILT DOWN TO\nSEE the exterior wall of the labyrinth. It is a high masonry wall\nthat extends off in either direction. Along the wall are various\nornamental bushes and there is a small figure of a dwarf, his back to\nus, peeing into a tiny pond. It looks for all the world like one of\nthose ornamental garden sculptures. But it isnt. This is HOGGLE. In\na CLOSER SHOT, which is quite discreet, HOGGLE finishes peeing, and\ngoes over to a particularly lush shrub. A few butterfly-like\ncreatures, flower fairies, flit around the bushes.]\nHOGGLE: An hows me pride an joy!\n[He leans forward to sniff one of the magnificent blossoms, sighing\nwith pleasure as he does. But before he can indulge he is stopped by\nthe whistling sound of a falling object. SARAH falls from the sky and\nlands right on his prize shrub! Incensed, he screams with fury.]\nHOGGLE: What is this? Look what you done! You murderer!\nSARAH: What are you saying, you horrible little man?!\nHOGGLE: I aint horrible, Im Hoggle. And just look! Youve\ndestroyed me prize blossoms!\nHOGGLE: Ill get ya for it, you big oaf!\n[And he picks up a spray can and goes after SARAH. But shes had\nenough. After the nightmarish kidnapping of FREDDIE and a drop from\nthe deepest space, this guy is childs play. She reaches out and\npulls the can from HOGGLEs hands. She then grabs him by the\nshirt-front and practically lifts him off the ground.]\nSARAH: Oh no you dont! If anyones getting anything around here,\nits me ... now where my brother?!!\nHOGGLE: I aint sayin nothin til ye let me go!\n.\nSARAH: Im sorry. But this just hasnt been my day.\nHOGGLE looks at his crushed shrub again.\nHOGGLE: Ye aint the only one.\nSARAH: And I dont understand any of this!\nHOGGLE: Now where have I heard that before.\nSARAH: What do you mean?\nHOGGLE: I mean, everyone who comes here thinkin they can make it\nthrough the labyrinth says sumthin like (mimicking Sarah in a whiny,\nhigh pitch) ... I dont understand this, whatever am I doing here,\nhow will I ever get home ...\nSARAH: What makes you think Im here to get through a labyrinth?\nHOGGLE: Cant think of any reason why youd be standin here in front\no this gate if you werent.\n[SARAH doesnt understand what he is talking about but when she looks\nup she cant believe her eyes.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[A huge gate where just a moment ago there nothing but smooth, endless\nwall. SARAH gulps in disbelief. Then the huge wooden doors fly open\nand a terrified CREATURE runs out, full speed, screaming for his\nlife. Right behind him come TWO MENACING GOBLINS riding on strange\nBEASTS. They are armed and dangerous looking. They quickly catch up\nwith the CREATURE and drag him, screaming piteously, back through the\ngate. Before the gates close SARAH can see MORE GOBLINS, what seems\nlike hundreds of them. SOME are mounted, MOST of them are armed. And\nbeyond them a walled passageway seems to go on forever. Then the\nwooden doors slam shut.]\nSARAH: Oh, no! Not more goblins!\nHOGGLE: Thats Jareths goblin army, and that other poor fool musta\nbeen caught meanderin where he had no business.\nSARAH: What will they do to him?\nHOGGLE: I dont like to think about things like that.\nSARAH: I wonder if things can get any worse?\nHOGGLE: Hes taken sumthin o yours, aint he?\nHOGGLE: Jareth, our high an mighty king ...\nHOGGLE: Bet hes gone and taken sumthin you love.\nSARAH : Close. Hes got my baby brother.\nHOGGLE: Baby snatchin! Thats low.\nSARAH: So Ive just got to do something!\nHOGGLE: Like what?\nSARAH: Get Freddie back, of course!\nHOGGLE: Then yad have ta make it through the labyrinth, cause\nJareths castle is at its very center.\nSARAH: Is it difficult?\nHOGGLE: Is me prize shrub crushed into oblivion?\nSARAH: Look, Im sorry about your bush! But its not like I asked to\nhave some weirdo come and take my baby brother and then drop me out\nof the sky!\nHOGGLE: Well, I didnt ask for some overgrown flower fairy to drop on\nme prized possession, neither!\nSARAH: Oh, this is ridiculous!\nSARAH : ... standing here wasting time talking to some\nweird guy who should be living under a bridge ...\n[She is almost at the gate when she freezes with fear. Through the\ngate she can hear the cheers and jeers of the GOBLINS, and what might\nbe the wailing of their poor CAPTIVE. Theres no way she wants to\nrisk facing that horrific CREW. HOGGLE has come up behind her and as\nshe backs away from the gate she bumps into him. She shrieks and\nwhirls around.]\nHOGGLE: That aint the only way in, ya know!\nSARAH: Its not?!\nHOGGLE: Course it aint. Theres many a route in ... just only one\nway out.\nSARAH: Well show me one! Ive got to find my brother!\n[HOGGLE sighs impatiently. Be fingers a belt that he wears, rattling\nit in an obvious manner. It in hung with every kind of watch and\nbracelet and ring you can imagine.]\nHOGGLE: Information like that has a price ...\nSARAH: I could give you this ...\nHOGGLE: I had sumthin o this caliber in mind ...\n[He takes her hand and WE SEE that she is wearing a beautiful ruby\nring. SARAH shakes her head vehemently.]\nSARAH: No. My mother gave me that.\nHOGGLE: She could give ya another ...\nSARAH: No, she couldnt. She\nlives real far away ...\nSARAH: This is all you get.\nHOGGLE: Bah! Its paste!\n[Something catches SARAHs eye. It is one of the tiny FLOWER FAIRIES.\nShe leans over for a better look.]\nSARAH: No its not, its plastic.\n[HOGGLEs eyes light up at that and he grunts with satisfaction as he\nstrings the circlet onto his belt. SARAH reaches out her hand to the\nFAIRY.]\nSARAH: What a beautiful little thing ...\nHOGGLE: Let me at it!\nSARAH: You murderer! How can you kill such beautiful creatures?!!\n[Just then the FAIRY gives SARAH a vicious bite. She shakes it off her\nhand and cries out in pain.]\nSARAH: It bit me!\n[HOGGLE quickly sprays the offending FAIRY and it falls to the earth,\nscreaming all the way.]\nHOGGLE: Of course it bit ya! Theres nuthin more vicious than a\nflower fairy. Any fool knows that!\nHOGGLE : But you dont know nuthin, do ya?\nHOGGLE: I got a feelin Im gonna regret this. he stalks off Come\nwith me an Ill show ya a way in.\n[SARAH hurries after him. As they walk along the endless wall HOGGLE\nlooks at the circlet and polishes it on his sleeve.]\nHOGGLE : Plastic!\nEXT: LABYRINTH - DAY\n[Another part of the wall. HOGGLE pushes a bush aside and shows SARAH\na tiny door. She looks at it dubiously.]\nHOGGLE: Thisll take ya into the maze, thats the first part of the\nlabyrinth ...\nSARAH: The first part! What comes after that?\nHOGGLE: Then theres the Garden Maze, then the Forbidden Forest ...\nSARAH: That sounds inviting ...\n[He is through the door. He is still talking but SARAH cant hear him.\nShe quickly tries to follow.]\nSARAH: Wait! Wait! I cant hear you ...\nINT: LABYRINTH - DAY\nHOGGLE: ... then comes the castle ...\nHOGGLE: ... thats surely where Jareths keepin the babe ...\n[He looks down at SARAH, she is through the door to her waist and\nstraining to get the rest of herself through. HOGGLE sighs and grabs\nher hand. With a groan he tugs on her and pulls her through the\ndoorway. She lands flat on her face.]\nHOGGLE: Ya dont seem ta be able ta do nuthin without my help, do ya?\n[He chuckles and SARAH gives him a look that could kill as she gets up\nand dusts herself off. She looks around and the environment seems\nrather benign. The brick walls are open to the sky, here and there a\nflower peeks through a crack.]\nSARAH: Oh, I think I can handle it. In fact, this place doesnt seem\nso bad at all.\nINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY\n[SARAH turns a corner and comes face to face with a FACE. It is huge\nand grotesque and protrudes out of the wall.]\nFACE: Go back! Go back before its too late!\n[SARAH screams and backs away from it, moving further down the\ncorridor. She backs into something and whirls around. It is ANOTHER\nFACE.]\nFACE 2: Turn back while you still can!!\nSARAH: Hoggle!\nINT: LABYRINTH - DAY\n[HOGGLE is still standing by the door, an amused smile on his face.\nSARAH comes rushing toward him.]\nSARAH: Oh, Im so glad youre still here! They were horrible ...\nHOGGLE: You dont mean the False Alarms, do ya?\n[He shakes his head and goes off in the direction that SARAH just came\nfrom.]\nHOGGLE: If ya gonna let a little thing like them scare ya, Missy, ya\nhavent a hope o makin it to the castle.\nSARAH: False Alarms?\nINT: CORRIDOR 1 - DAY\n[The corridor of faces. HOGGLE enters and the FACES start in on their\nroutine. SARAH comes up behind him, shuddering at the ghastly sight.]\nFACE 1: This is the path of no return!\nFACE 2: Beware! Beware!\nHOGGLE: Just ignore em.\nSARAH: Are you sure?\nFACE 3: Abandon all hope ...\nHOGGLE: Oh, shut up, will ya?\nFACE 3: But I was just getting to the best part!\nHOGGLE: All right. But dont expect us to pay any attention.\nFACE 3 : Youre going to love this ... Abandon all\nhope ye who enter here, for this is the road to destruction!!!\nHOGGLE : Very nice ...\nFACE 3: Come back any time ... I mean, youre doomed, doomed!\nINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\nHOGGLE: Ya see, things arent always what they appear to be around\nhere, Missy ...\nSARAH : Whatever. All Im interested in is getting my\nbrother back from that creep.\nHOGGLE: I admire yer determination, but it takes moren that to beat\nJareth.\nSARAH: Well, maybe Im beginning to get the hang of this labyrinth\nbusiness.\nSARAH: See, now Ill know which way we came in case I get lost.\nHOGGLE : Missy, goin back the way ya came is par fer the\ncourse around here, what ya want to do is go forward.\nSARAH: Look, Hoggle! Ive got to find Freddie and I dont need you to\ndiscourage me!\nHOGGLE: And I dont need to be wastin me time goin around in\ncircles with you!\nSARAH: Thats fine with me! I know youre only after\nmy ring, anyway!\n[She turns a corner and HOGGLE looks after her, hurt and pity crossing\nhis face. He takes a few steps in her direction and an officious\nlittle creature, a BRICKKEEPER, emerges from the brickwork of the\nfloor, takes out the cobblestone that SARAH marked, and replaces it\nwith the marked side hidden. It looks up at HOGGLE.]\nBRICKKEEPER: Some people got no respect for property!\n[HOGGLE sticks his tongue out at the CREATURE just as it goes back\ninto its hole.]\nEXT: AERIAL SHOT - DAY\n[The WHITE BIRD flies over the maze and WE SEE SARAH marching along.\nShe thinks shes going forward but shes heading right for HOGGLE.]\nINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\nSARAH: But ...\nSARAH: ... but you were just behind me! Im sure of it!\nSARAH: My mark! It was right here!\nHOGGLE: I told ya, Missy. Things arent what they appear to be around\nhere ...\nJARETH : Except when they are.\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[JARETH, in all his glory. SARAH and HOGGLE whirl around and BOTH gasp\nwith surprise and fear.]\nJARETH: We meet again ... Sarah.\nSARAH: Wheres Freddie?!! What have you done with him!?\nJARETH: Nothing ... yet.\n[He walks toward them and they automatically step backwards. He looks\ndown at HOGGLE.]\nJARETH: And what have we here ... Hoghead, isnt it?\nHOGGLE: Me names Hoggle.\nJARETH: Ah, yes. Now I remember. Youre\nthe greedy little coward who lives outside the gate. Shouldnt you be\nback there minding your own business ... Hedgehog?\n[He chucks HOGGLE under the chin, and is quite rough about it. HOGGLE\nfumes silently. SARAH doesnt like this.]\nSARAH: Why, why dont you pick on someone your own size?\nJARETH: Whom did you have in mind?\nSARAH: I dont have time for any games. I want Freddie, and I want\nhim now!\nJARETH: Ah, Freddie. An adorable little imp. Im really growing\nrather fond of him.\nSARAH: Where is he?!!\nJARETH: Hes in my castle, and seems to be enjoying himself immensely.\n[He ambles toward them and they cant help themselves, they BOTH step\nbackwards.]\nJARETH: In fact, he likes being with goblins so much, Im considering\nturning him into one.\nSARAH: You cant do that!\nJARETH : Oh yes I can.\nSARAH: Can he?\nHOGGLE nods glumly.\nJARETH: But lets make it interesting. I wont do it for ... thirteen\nhours. If you make it to the castle before then you might be able to\nsave him. If not, well, I think little Freddie will mike an adorable\ngoblin prince, dont you?\n[He laughs and holds up both hands and WE SEE that they are empty. He\nthen closes them and when he opens them again there is a gold watch\nin one hand. He throws it to SARAH, but HOGGLE intercepts it and eyes\nit greedily. Annoyed, SARAH snatches it out of his hand. She looks at\nit and sees that it has 13 hours marked on it. When she looks up\nagain, JARETH is gone.]\nWORM : Well, good riddance to bad rubbish!\n[SARAH and HOGGLE BOTH jump and then look at where the voice is coming\nfrom. It is a little WORM, poking its head out of a hole in the\nbrickwork.]\nWORM: Thats what the missus always says, she does. Why the last time\nshe found that one around here she sent him packing.\nSARAH: Jareth?!\nWORM: She dont take to his kind of nonsense, thats for sure. Now,\nhow about a nice cup of tea? The missus has a kettle on.\n[SARAH looks down at HOGGLE, who shrugs. She then looks up at the WORM\nand gives him a beaming smile.]\nINT: CORRIDOR 2 - DAY\nSARAH: Do you think Jareth will give Freddie back if I make it on\ntime?\nHOGGLE: Its hard to say, Missy. But if I were you, Id worry bout\nfirst things first.\nSARAH: What do you mean?\nHOGGLE: I means ya got ta find the castle before ya can go savin the\nbabe and I mean ta see that ya do!\nSARAH is thrilled and leans over and gives him a kiss on the cheek.\nSARAH: Oh, Hoggle! Thank you, thank you so much!\nHOGGLE: Seems to me I could be gettin that ring from ya after all if\nI plays me cards right.\nSARAH: I know you dont mean that. Youre helping me because youre\nreally nice.\nHOGGLE: I aint nice! I just likes the way ya stood up ta him is all.\n Too bad moreve us\nhavent had the guts to do the same.\nWORM: How about a biscuit? The missus just took a fresh batch out of\nthe oven.\nSARAH: Thanks, but we really dont have any time. Weve got to get to\nthe castle.\nHOGGLE: Ya wouldnt happen to know a shortcut, would ya?\nWORM: Well, you might try taking that first left.\nSARAH and HOGGLE look down the corridor.\nSARAH: But there isnt any left turn.\n[Just then a strange FIGURE seems to come through the left wall and\nwalks toward them. He is dressed in long flowing robes and wears a\nhat shaped like a bird.]\nWORM: See, theres a left turn right there, where that Wise One just\ncame in.\nSARAH: A Wise One! Maybe he knows the best way to the castle!\nHOGGLE: I wouldnt bet on it.\nSARAH: Excuse me, Sir. Could you tell us the best way to get to the\ncastle?\nWISE ONE: The best way to the castle, hmmm. Im glad you asked that\nquestion.\nHAT: Now youve done it, gone and asked him a question. Well be here\nall day!\nWISE ONE: A castle, or fortress, or as it is sometimes known, a\nstronghold or citadel -- or, that which has a turret and barbican,\nbut usually not a portcullis ...\nHAT: What did I tell you? Theres no stopping him now.\nWISE ONE: ... often there is a rampart or bulwark, and then a parapet\n-- perchance an actual vallum or counterscarp ...\nHAT: Shut up down there!\nWISE ONE: ... and for entrenchment; a moat, drawbridge and sally-port\n...\nSARAH: This was not one of my better ideas.\nHAT: Well, I told you that, didnt I? But nobody ever listens to me!\nHAT: Enough! Nobody cares!!\nWISE ONE: Did one of you say something?\nSARAH: Oh, no. We never talk to strangers.\nWISE ONE: Thats very wise. An idea worth savoring.\nHOGGLE: Yeah, but keep it under your hat!\nHOGGLE thinks this is hilarious. The HAT doesnt.\nHAT: Ve-ry funny!\nWISE ONE: The stranger, hmm. Im glad you brought that up. The\nstranger; one not indigenous, also known as the alien, or one from\nbeyond the sea ...\nHAT : I quit! I cant take it anymore!\n[And then they are gone, passing through the righthand wall as if it\nwasnt there. SARAH watches after them, stunned.]\nSARAH: How did he do that?!!\nHOGGLE: And how can we make sure he doesnt come back?\nWORM: Just go over to that bit of wall there and walk right through\nit. The important thing is to forget what you think you know. It\ndoesnt apply around here.\n[SARAH and HOGGLE walk down to the part of the wall where the WISE ONE\nentered. Once there, they can see that a section of the wall is\nactually a passageway-width behind the rest of the wall. SARAH yells\nback to the WORM.]\nSARAH: Thank you! And tell the missus were sorry we missed her\nbiscuits!\nINT: CORRIDOR 3 - DAY\n[SARAH and HOGGLE appear through the wall and SARAH laughs with\ndelight. HOGGLE wasnt as pleased with the experience and feels the\nwall as if testing to see if it really happened. SARAH sees that they\nare in a corridor where the walls are crumbling and she climbs up to\nthe top of one and looks over.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nSARAHS POV - THE TURRETS OF THE CASTLE\nSARAH : I can see the castle! It doesnt look far at all!\n[HOGGLE is still feeling around the wall, trying to figure out how\nthey got there. SARAH jumps down and starts to run down the corridor.]\nSARAH: Come on, Hoggle. Lets go!\n30\tINT: CASTLE - DAY\n[JARETHs great hall. He stands by a window and looks out over the\nlabyrinth -- from this vantage point he can see clear across it: the\nhovels that surround the castle walls, the arid plain that leads to\nthe dense forest, encircling that, the complex maze. He seems lost in\nthought. The WHITE BIRD enters the window and lands on his shoulder.\nBehind him FREDDIE is having a grand time. His slippery crawl is too\nmuch for the GOBLINS that scurry about, trying to mind him.\nMeanwhile, a particularly stupid looking GOBLIN begins to approach\nJARETH. He saunters across the room and is stopped short by a FEMALE\nGOBLIN. She grabs hold of his shirt and hisses a warning.]\nFEMALE GOBLIN: Remember! Its bow and scrape ... bow and scrape ...\n[The STUPID GOBLIN nods and she lets him go. He then continues his\napproach to JARETH, only this time he does a little bow and then\nscrapes his foot across the floor, then repeats the action.]\nSTUPID GOBLIN : Bow n scrape ... bow n scrape ...\nJARETH: Well, what is it?\n[The GOBLIN cant answer and do his bow-and-scrape at the same time so\ncontinues his painfully slow approach.]\nSTUPID GOBLIN: ... bow n scrape ... bow n scrape ...\n[Annoyed, JARETH walks over to the GOBLIN and lifts him up by his\nshirt front. The GOBLIN is still bowing.]\nJARETH: I said, what is it?!!!\nSTUPID GOBLIN: Th ... the girl and Hoggle, sire. Th ... theyre\nhalfway th .... through th ... the maze.\n[JARETH drops the GOBLIN hard on the floor. FREDDIE sees this and\nlaughs with delight. JARETH walks over and scoops the BABY up in his\narms. He then carries him over to the window. He calls over to an\nARMED GOBLIN by the door.]\nJARETH: I think its time they had some company.\nARMED GOBLIN: Yes, Sir!\n[He then salutes, causing his visor to close on his face, then\nstumbles around looking for the door. JARETH shakes his head.]\nJARETH: Youll make a much better goblin than that, wont you,\nFreddie!\n[FREDDIEs response is to clap his sticky babys hand on to JARETHs\nface. JARETH, pretending he doesnt mind, carefully removes it. He\nthen looks down to the courtyard below.]\nEXT: CASTLE - DAY\nJARETHS POV\nARMED GOBLINS are pouring out of the castle.\nEXT: CORRIDOR 4 - DAY\n[SARAH and HOGGLE are striding down a corridor. They are about to come\nto a corner.]\nSARAH: Are you sure Jareth can turn Freddie into a goblin? I mean,\nthats really weird ...\nSARAH: What is it?\nHOGGLE gestures for her to be quiet and then we can hear what he\nhears -- marching. They look back the way they came.\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAHS AND HOGGLES POV - A BATTALION OF ARMED GOBLINS, marching\nright towards them!]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[They look at each other, then turn and run. HOGGLE tries to get\nthrough the wall the way the WORM showed them.]\nHOGGLE : Just forget what you think you know and ...\n[He smacks headlong into the wall. He stops to rub his nose and SARAH\nflies by him.]\nSARAH: Come on!\nINT: CASTLE - DAY\n[FREDDIE is now sitting on the lap of a GOBLIN, happily bopping it on\nthe nose. JARETH snaps his fingers and a GROUP of sleepy MUSICIANS in\nthe corner stumble over themselves to pick up their instruments. They\nbegin to play and JARETH looks out the window and begins a song. He\nsings about the labyrinth; what it is -- his domain, and what it is\nto OTHERS -- a test, a proving-ground, not for the faint of heart.]\nINT: MAZE MONTAGE - DAY\n[While JARETH sings, SARAH and HOGGLE try to escape from the GOBLINS.\nThey get a lead on them for a while and come to another corridor with\ncrumbling walls. They scamper up to get a look at their position and\nsee dust rising from several parts of the maze. The GOBLINS are\neverywhere.]\n[In another corridor, they are stopped in their tracks by DOZENS OF\nLITTLE FUZZY CREATURES who scurry towards them out of the way of the\noncoming GOBLINS. They turn and run back the way they came and as\nthey do WALL CREATURES chatter nervously and then disappear into the\ncracks between the bricks.]\n[In a corridor with very short walls they are able to see the tips of\nspears on either side of them, going in the opposite direction.]\n[They enter a corridor with several arches curving over it, forming\nsmall, intermittent bridges. Thinking they are safe, they stop for a\nbreath, and soon realize that a BATTALION is right behind them. They\nscurry up the walls, and as the song comes to an end, they each lie\nacross an arch hopefully out of sight of the GOBLINS below.]\nINT: ARCHED CORRIDOR - DAY\n[SARAH and HOGGLE huddle above the corridor on their arches as TWO\nGOBLINS bring up the rear.]\nGOBLIN 1: I can kill better than you can.\nGOBLIN 2: But Im better at maiming. Everybody says so.\n[And they are gone. Shaken, SARAH and HOGGLE slide down from their\nhiding places.]\nSARAH: Do you think theyre gone?\nHOGGLE: Sure they are. Goblins aint known fer their intelligence, ya\nknow. They has as much trouble findin their way through the maze as\nyou do.\nSARAH: Im not sure, but I think you just called me stupid ...\n[Suddenly HOGGLE yells and disappears. He has accidentally leaned on\nanother secret wall opening. SARAH quickly follows.]\nINT: CORRIDOR 5 - DAY\n[HOGGLE and SARAH are now in the long circular corridor that divides\nthe maze from the beginning of the second ring of the labyrinth --\nthe Garden Maze.]\nHOGGLE : I think I know where we are!\nSARAH: Thatll be a nice change.\nHOGGLE: This place is the end o the maze! That means were near the\nentrance ta the second ring o the labyrinth.\nSARAH: The second ring? Whats that?\nHOGGLE starts down the corridor.\nHOGGLE : The Garden Maze!\nSARAH : Sounds like a great place ... whats it like?\nHOGGLE: Dont know, I aint never made it this far before.\n[He is skipping happily down the corridor when SARAH hears something.\nIt is a strange clanking sound.]\nSARAH : Hoggle! Whats that sound?!!\nHOGGLE: Now dont go gettin all girly on me, Missy, now that wes\nfinally safe ...\nSARAH: So you think were safe, do you?\nHOGGLE : Didnt I just say so?!!\nSARAH: Then tell me what you think of that.\n[SARAH points behind them where the clanking noise is coming from. It\nis now much louder. HOGGLE comes over to her and takes a better look.\nHe screams.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[THEIR POV - A SLASHING MACHINE is coming right towards them. (A\nslashing wall is made up of rows of furiously spinning knives, and\nchopping cleavers, and has brushes along the bottom to clean up\nwhatever it encounters in its path.) And there is no way around it\nbecause it completely fills the corridor.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[HOGGLE desperately tries to walk through the wall the way they came\nin, but it is to no avail. He just keeps smashing his face. SARAH\nstarts to run for it.]\nSARAH: Come on!\n[HOGGLE follows, every so often trying, and failing, to get through\nthe wall.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH, who is far ahead of HOGGLE, comes to a door! And hanging on a\nhook next to it is a bunch of keys. She looks back at HOGGLE.]\nSARAH: Hoggle, hurry!\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAHS POV - HOGGLE running toward her, and making slow but steady\nprogress toward them BOTH -- the slashing machine.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH fumbles with the keys, furiously trying key after key in the\ndoor but to no avail. She is terrified.]\nSARAH: None of the keys work!\n[Desperate, she starts banging on the door. HOGGLE is just a few yards\naway from her.]\nHOGGLE: Why dont you just try it?\n[He then tries once more to walk through the wall. SARAH tries the\nknob and sure enough, it opens. She is delighted. What she doesnt\nsee is HOGGLE suddenly disappearing through the floor.]\nSARAH: Its open! Hog ...\n[She turns around and he is gone! And the slashing machine is just a\nfew yards away! She screams and, in her terror, falls backwards\nthrough the door. It slams shut just as the slashing machine reaches\nit WE CAN SEE that FOUR GOBLINS in sanitation workers uniforms have\nbeen pushing the machine all along. They grunt and strain, cranking\nthe wheels that turn the knives and pushing all at the same time.]\nINT: PICTURE GALLERY - DAY\n[SARAH emerges into a large room. The walls are covered with large\npaintings in ornate gilt frames. She is a bit stunned by the clone\ncall with the slashing machine as she approaches the first painting.]\nSARAH : What in the world ...\n[She stops short in front of the first painting and cannot believe her\neyes. It is a painting of the watch with 13 hours on it. The hour\nhand is on the 9. SARAH fumbles into her pocket and finds the watch\nthat Jareth gave her. It also has the hour hand on the 9.]\nSARAH: Only 9 hours left!\n[The next picture is of a BABY surrounded by gruesome GOBLINS. On\ncloser inspection, the BABY is obviously FREDDIE. She chokes back a\nsob and runs over to the next one, it is a picture of a rotunda with\nstaircases going off in all different directions on different planes\nof gravity. It is an Escher room, and a closer look shows a GOBLIN\nhappily standing on the ceiling. She shakes her head and goes by the\nnext painting and gasps involuntarily. It is a compelling portrait of\nJARETH, and she moves even closer. Then she shakes herself out of it.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[THE PORTRAITS POV - SARAH wills herself away and moves on, and we\nhear the sound of JARETHs breathing.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH is nervous and eagerly looks for a way out. She rushes by\nanother painting, giving it merely a glance. But something makes her\ngo back for a better look. It is of a lovely, manicured hedge maze.\nIn the distance WE CAN SEE the turrets of JARETHs castle. And in the\nsky nearby flies a beautiful WHITE BIRD. And then SARAH is amazed by\nwhat she sees. A closer look at the painting reveals that the WHITE\nBIRD is flying! It moves over the hedges and WE SEE a FIGURE waving.]\nSARAH: Hoggle!\n[SARAH, disturbed, backs away from the painting. And then, because it\nreally is as wonderful as it is scary, she goes back for another look\nand over her shoulder WE CAN SEE HOGGLE waving and we hear his tiny\nvoice.]\nHOGGLE: Missy! Over here! This is the way to the castle!\n[And SARAH strains to hear, and leans toward the painting, stretching\nher hand out and touching the painting, which makes it turn into a\nshimmering wall that her hand goes right through. And then she\ndisappears right through the painting.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nEXT: HEDGE MAZE - DAY\nSARAH: What happened to you? I was afraid Id never see you again!\nHOGGLE: Ya know that trick with the wall? Damn, if it dont work with\nthe floor, as well!\nINT : HEDGE MAZE - DAY\n[SARAH and HOGGLE have been walking through the maze a long time. They\nare tired and bedraggled. SARAH pulls the watch out of her pocket and\nsighs.]\nSARAH: An hours gone by and I dont think were more than four feet\nfrom where we started.\nHOGGLE: Thats cause ya wont do what I tells ya. Its clear as day\nwe should be goin this way ...\n[He turns a corner and walks smack into a hedge dead end. He howls in\npain and SARAH sighs and follows him.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nSARAH: Got any more suggestions?\n[Before HOGGLE can answer they are interrupted by a terrible\ngut-wrenching scream. It is positively unearthly. SARAH whirls around.]\nSARAH: It sounds like it came from over there!\nHOGGLE: Then lets go this way.\nSARAH: Hoggle! It sounds like someones being hurt!\nHOGGLE: Exactly why we should be headin in the othermost direction!\n[SARAH shakes her head in disgust and runs off as the screams become\nmore unbearable.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH, running through the hedge maze. Driven by the sound of the\nscreams, she has an unconscious ability to find her way through.\nHOGGLE, trying to keep up with her, keeps running into dead ends.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH emerging from the maze. She is stopped in her tracks by what\nshe sees and quickly covers her mouth to prevent herself from\nscreaming. HOGGLE emerges a moment later, barely pauses before he\nheads right back into the maze.]\nEXT: CLEARING - DAY\n that\nthey have hung by his ankle from a tree limb. They have also taken\npains to bind the CREATURE, who it is obvious could take an most of\nthem and win in a fairer fight. He is about nine feet tall,\npowerfully built, and his screams of frustrated agony are truly\nunbearable. The GOBLINS have devised a unique method of harassing\nhim. They ALL carry long sticks which have small, fierce, biting\nCREATURES on the end of them. The GOBLINS bat their sticks at LUDO,\nwho bellows and tries to swat back. Since he is tied, the NIPPERS are\nfree to bite him whenever they get near.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nSARAH: The poor thing!\n[HOGGLE peeks out from behind SARAH, then quickly ducks back. SARAH\nlooks for a way to stop the torture. She picks up a rock and\ncarefully aims it at the nearest GOBLIN. It hits his head and knocks\nhis helmet visor over his eyes. Blinded, the GOBLIN lurches around,\nswinging his nipper stick at the OTHER THREE.]\nBLINDED GOBLIN: Hey! Who turned out the lights?\n[The OTHER GOBLINS see a new target and poke their nipper sticks\ntowards him. He takes off and runs blindly into the hedge maze. The\nOTHER THREE chase him, carrying the nipper sticks upright no that WE\nCAN SEE their progress in the BG.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds LUDO\nsuspended upside down. She cant undo it and yells for HOGGLE]\nSARAH: Get out here, you coward!\n[HOGGLE appears from behind his hedge. He hesitates, then pulls a\ndagger from his belt and joins SARAH. He cuts through the rope in one\nhack, and LUDO falls to the ground with a thud.[\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[The nipper sticks start yammering away as they see SARAH and HOGGLE\nfreeing LUDO over the top of the hedge. The GOBLIN chase stops and\nthey head back to the clearing. HOGGLE dives for the bushes but a\ndetermined SARAH stays and pulls off the ropes. When LUDO is free, he\npicks up a huge log. As the FOUR GOBLINS come roaring back into the\nclearing, LUDO waves the log over his head. The GOBLIN charge\nimmediately shifts into a GOBLIN retreat, the nipper sticks yipping\nin fear.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[LUDO puts down the log and sits, his big shaggy head hanging down. He\ntaken one hand and wipes away a tear.]\nLUDO: Ludo ... hurt.\nSARAH: Is that your name? Ludo?\nLUDO: Goblins ... mean to Ludo.\nSARAH: Oh, I know! They were terribly mean to you. (she moves closer\nand pats his arm) But its all right now.\n[LUDO sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile\nyou have ever seen.]\nLUDO: Friend!\nSARAH: Thats right, Ludo! Im your friend. Im Sarah.\nLUDO: Sarah ... friend!\n[HOGGLE has come out from hiding during this exchange. He finds the\nwhole scene a bit nauseating. And an unnecessary nuisance. If theres\none thing he doesnt want, its competition for SARAH.]\nHOGGLE: I think Im about ta be sick.\n[They ignore him and LUDO grins for all hes worth as SARAH beams up\nat him. HOGGLE pulls her over to one side.]\nHOGGLE: I hope yer not thinkin o lettin the beast traipse along,\nMissy. Hell just slow us up.\nSARAH: Are you kidding?! Hell be a great help! The goblins are\nscared of him because hes so fierce ...\n[Just then LUDO shyly offers SARAH a flower that he has just picked\nfor her. She takes it and smiles at him.]\nHOGGLE : I sees what ya mean.\nSARAH shrugs and gives LUDO a pat. HOGGLE sighs with frustration.\nHOGGLE: I just thinks we was doin fine on our own.\nSARAH: And we can do even better with Ludo. You want\nto help me save my baby brother, dont you, Ludo?\nLUDO: Save ... baby. Good!\n[SARAH nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze. LUDO\nright behind her. HOGGLE follows, clearly unhappy.]\nEXT: FOREST GATE - DAY\n[SARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO come out of the hedge maze and see a wall with\ntwo SARAH-sized doors in it.]\nHOGGLE: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden Forest. All we\ngotta do is pick a door ...\nSARAH: What difference does it make? Lets just go!\nLUDO: One door ... good. One door ... bad.\nHOGGLE: Well, thats great news. Dont suppose ya know\nwhich is which?\n[SARAH skirts around LUDO and goes up to the doors for a closer look\nat them.]\nLUDO: One door ... good. One door ...\nHOGGLE: All right, ya walkin mountain! Ya made ya point.\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH ignores the bickering behind her and examines the doors. Each\none has a door knocker on it. Both knockers are carved into faces,\nexcept one has the ring going through its ears and the other has it\nstuck in its mouth.]\nSARAH : I guess once you choose a door ... all you have\nto do is knock.\nKNOCKER 1: Are you addressing me?\nSARAH: You can talk!\nKNOCKER 1: What? What? Youll have to speak up!!\nKNOCKER 2: mmffn ... grnth ... sminvl ...\nSARAH: You too!\nKNOCKER 2: ... gmft ... bmble ...\nANOTHER ANGLE\nHOGGLE: If yer so smart why not show us another way inta the forest?\nLUDO: Ludo ... not ... know.\nHOGGLE: That figures, dont it? \nWhy the Missy wants an overgrown hill o hair fer a friend is beyond\nme.\n[LUDO tries to make HOGGLE feel better and pats him on the shoulder.\nHOGGLE shakes his hand off with a growl.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nSARAH: I love it! Talking doors!! Are you the right\ndoor to the forest?\nKNOCKER 1: It doesnt do to ask me. For some reason I cant hear a\nthing.\nKNOCKER 1: No use asking him, either. All he does is mumble.\nKNOCKER 2: thgt ... vrnf ... lcl ...\nSARAH: I get it! You cant talk with that ring in your mouth!\nSARAH: Now, tell me which one of you is the right door to the forest.\nKNOCKER 2: Oh, I am. No question about it.\nSARAH: Great! How do we get you to open up?\nKNOCKER 2: One merely has to knock.\nSARAH: Of course, why didnt I think of that.\nKNOCKER 2: Oh no you dont, young lady! Ive had just about enough of\nthat awful thing, thank you very much!\nSARAH: But how are we supposed to get through this door if you wont\nlet me knock on it?\nKNOCKER 2: Well, I really couldnt say now, could I?\nKNOCKER 1: Oh do speak up, both of you? I cant hear a thing!\nANOTHER ANGLE\nHOGGLE : Ya know ... even if she does get the door\nopen, ya wont be able ta fit through. Why not make it easy on us all\nand take a hike?\nLUDO: Ludo ... Stay!\nHOGGLE: Yer quite the speechifier, aint ya?\nANOTHER ANGLE\nSARAH: Are you sure there isnt anything I can do to change your mind?\nKNOCKER 2: Absolutely not! My lips are sealed!\nSARAH: Thats what I thought!\n[The KNOCKER presses its lips firmly together. SARAH deftly squeezes\nits nose shut. It sputters for air and finally has to open its mouth\nbefore it suffocates. SARAH shoves the ring in with a gleeful cry of\ntriumph. She knocks, and the door swings open.]\nSARAH: Lets go!\n[She goes through the door and HOGGLE and LUDO race to follow. They\nBOTH try to get through the door at the same time and get into such a\ntangle that the door closes before they can straighten themselves out.]\nHOGGLE: Now youve done it!\nHOGGLE: Missy! Missy, wait!\nEXT: FORBIDDEN FOREST - DAY\n[SARAH on the other side of the door. Except on this side, there is no\ndoor, just a long expanse of wall. The forest is very dark, and as\nits name suggests, very forbidding. SARAH can hear HOGGLE calling,\nbut it is very faint.]\nSARAH : Hoggle?\nEXT: FOREST GATE - DAY\n[HOGGLE is beating on the doors with such a frenzy that the other door\nswings open.]\nHOGGLE: Im coming ...\n[He rushes through the door and disappears. We can tell from his voice\nthat he is falling down a deep hole.]\nHOGGLE : ... Miiiiiiiiissy!\nLUDO: Sarah ... gone. Hoggle ... gone.\n[He is sad and confused. A FIGURE emerges from the hedge maze and\nbegins to walk along the wall, away from LUDO. It is the WISE ONE.\nLUDO brightens and chases after them.]\nLUDO: Wait!\nHAT: This ought to be a good one!\nLUDO: Ludo ... need ... door!\nWISE ONE: You have need of a door, do you? Ah, yes. A very useful\nthing, the door; also known as a portal or threshold -- and that\nwhich gives access, a gate or gangway ...\nWISE ONE: ... also an entrance or entry, often accompanied by a\npropylaeum ...\nHAT : If only I had hands I could cover my ears ... that is,\nif I had ears ...\nWISE ONE: ... not to be confused with a window, or fenestration ...\nEXT: FOREST - DAY\nSARAH: Hoggle, Ludo ... where are you?\n[She reaches into her pocket and looks at the watch. The hour hand is\non the 7.]\nSARAH: Oh, Freddie! she shoves the watch back into her\npocket Well, you guys are going to have to catch up with me cause I\ncant wait.\nINT: HOLE - DAY\n[HOGGLE is in a pool at the bottom of a deep hole in the ground. There\nis a ledge just above him and he splashes violently trying to reach it.]\nHOGGLE: Somebody help me! I cant swim!\nEXT: FOREST - DAY\n[SARAH is in a very thick, creepy part of the woods. She is clearly\nlost. She gets herself tangled in a thorn bush, and struggles with it\nto get herself free. Finally she does, and then, frustrated, sits\ndown on the ground.]\nSARAH: Why does everything have to happen to me?\n[But theres no time to think about that because she hears the sound\nof a driving drum rhythm and then a wild-looking, spindly, leering\nLITTLE CREATURE comes scampering through the trees and into the\nclearing; and then ANOTHER, and ANOTHER and ANOTHER. SARAH is\nterrified as they approach her, but then not so terrified because the\nCREATURES arent doing anything except dancing; wild, loose-limbed,\nfrenzied dancing. SARAH laughs, and cant help but be taken in by the\nwild spectacle. And then they begin to encircle her, still moving to\nthe wild rhythm.]\nSARAH : What are you?\nWILD THING 1: Were Wild Things, baby! Wild!\nWILD THING 2: Wild and free!\nWILD THING 3: Get down!\n[And then more WILD THINGS appear, and these produce instruments. As\nand turn the drum rhythm into a frenzied upbeat number.]\nWILD THING 1: You call that wild! Ill show you wild!\n[And then he does an amazing thing, to say the least. He takes his\nhead off and rolls it along his arms from hand to hand like a\njuggler, then tosses it high in the air and deftly catches it on his\nshoulders. SARAH gasps and tries to get sway but another WILD THING\npushes her back into the middle of the melee.]\nWILD THING 2: Cut me some slack and move on back!\n[And they do, and, moving to the pounding rhythm, he takes his eyes\nout of his head and waves them at SARAH. He then tosses them on the\nground as if they were a pair of dice. They land at SARAHs feet\nlooking straight up.]\nWILD THING 2: Snake eyes!\n[SARAH is fascinated and repelled. And the beat gets hotter and the\nfrenzy more frenzied and she cant help getting a little wild\nherself. She begins to really dance.]\nWILD THING 3: Thats it, baby, get wild and free! But youll never be\nas wild as me!\n[And to prove it he takes his head off and begins to dribble it like a\nbasketball. WILD THING 1 leans over to SARAH and whispers\nconspiratorily.]\nWILD THING 1: I wouldnt call that really wild, would you?\nSARAH: Well, its ... uh ... sort of ...\nWILD THING 1: Id call this wild ...\n[And he takes off his head, puts it on the ground as if it were a golf\nball, and then removes a leg and uses it as a golf club. The head\ngoes flying, right to SARAH. SARAH catches the head, then tries to\nget it back to its body but the body dances into the middle of all\nthe other WILD THINGS and she cant find it. So theres SARAH,\nrunning around like a chicken with two heads when suddenly the ears\nstart to flap and the head flies out of her hand. A WILD THING grabs\nher hand and turns her around.]\nWILD THING 2: That was wild, baby. he starts to dance Now how\nbout gettin wild with me?\nSARAH: I think Ill sit this one out ...\nWILD THING 1: Not with us you dont ...\nWILD THING 2: Cause were wild!\n[And then theyre all over her, like a bunch of hyper puppies, and\nits really too much.]\nSARAH: Enough! Ive got to find the castle!\nWILD THING 2: Well, why didnt you say so, baby!\nWILD THING 3: Thats a _wild_ idea!\n[And then his head flies off and he has to quickly grab it and put it\nback and meanwhile the OTHERS start pushing and pulling on SARAH and\npropel her into the woods.]\nWILD THING 1: They got some wild goings on at the castle, baby!\nINT: HOLE - DAY\n[HOGGLE is holding on to the ledge with his fingertips. He doesnt\nhave the strength to hold on much longer and he looks down at the\nwater in mortal terror. He begins to slip just as a door opens in the\nsheer rock and JARETH enters, accompanied by GOBLINS.]\nJARETH: Well, what have we here ... if it isnt little Piggle!\n[HOGGLE screams and slips into the water. He tries to struggle back to\nthe ledge but the GOBLINS push at him with poles, laughing maniacally.]\nJARETH: Did the girl decide she doesnt need you, now that she has\nthat beast?\nHOGGLE : She wouldnt do nuthin like that!\nJARETH: Dont you know she could never care for a repulsive thing\nlike you!\nHOGGLE: She does care! Me n Sarah is friends!\nJARETH: Only until something better comes along ... and Ive\ndefinitely got something better in mind!\nHOGGLE: Dont you hurt her!\n[HOGGLE grabs on to the ledge and the gleeful GOBLINS push him back\ndown into the water.]\nJARETH: What I do to her is my business ... and it is inevitable.\nJARETH: You can be with me or against me.\nHOGGLE : Wh ... what do I gotta do?\nJARETH: I doubt if she can make it to the castle in time ...\nJARETH: But just in case, I want you to deliver her to me.\nHOGGLE: Never! Id rather die!\nJARETH: Then so you shall.\n[He drops HOGGLE back into the water. The GOBLINS shriek with delight.\nHOGGLE goes under and comes up sputtering.]\nHOGGLE: Wait!\n[JARETH was about to leave. He turns back to HOGGLE, a look of\namusement on his face.]\nHOGGLE: I gotta know what ... what youll do to her!\nJARETH: I will do what ever amuses me ...\nJARETH: All you have to do is give her this.\n[He tosses HOGGLE the peach. HOGGLE catches it and immediately the\nwater starts to recede.]\nJARETH: Youve made a very wise decision.\nHOGGLE: I didnt decide nuthin!\n[HOGGLE stares forlornly at the peach, and soon the water is gone and\nhe is sitting on cold, damp ground.]\nEXT: FOREST - DAY\n[The WILD THINGS are leading SARAH on a rocky path. She stumbles along\nbut they couldnt care less.]\nSARAH: Are you sure this is the way to the castle?\nWILD THING 1: Oh, did you say the castle?\nWILD THING 2: I thought she said hassle!\nWILD THING 3: I thought she said rassle!\nWILD THING 1: Rassle! Thats a wild idea!\nSARAH: OK, guys, funs over.\nWILD THING 2: Over! Its just begun!\n[And then the musicians are back and the dancing gets wilder than\never. The WILD THINGS totally surround SARAH, and though they arent\nhurting her, they are definitely not letting her out. What they do is\nstart throwing their heads at each other and switching them.]\nWILD THINGS 1, 2 & 3: Now this is really wild!\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[A door opens in a nearby boulder and LUDO appears. In the background\nWE CAN SEE and hear the WISE ONE as he wanders off.]\nWISE ONE: ... very often preceded by a porch, or portico, also\nverandah, and followed by a vestibule, otherwise known as an\nantechamber or foyer ...\nHAT: Why me?!!\n[The door closes. LUDO sees SARAH in the middle of this weirdness and\nis just a bit confused. SARAH sees him amidst the flying heads and\ncries out in relief.]\nSARAH: Ludo!\nLUDO: Sarah ... not ... want ... castle?\nSARAH: Are you kidding?!! Get me out of here!!!\n[LUDO approaches the WILD THINGS and grabs a head before it reaches\nits target and calmly tosses it into the trees.]\nWILD THING 3: Hey, big fella! Thats a little too wild ...\n[But theres no time to talk because LUDO calmly catches the other\nheads and tosses them away. The bodies go scurrying after their\nheads, followed by the MUSICIANS. SARAH is free.]\nSARAH: Oh, Ludo! Im so glad youre here!\nSARAH: Wheres Hoggle?\nLUDO: Hoggle ... in ... bad ... door.\nSARAH: Weve got to find him! Do you think we can?\nLUDO is very confident. He spent a lot of time with the WISE ONE.\nLUDO: Ludo ... knows ... doors ...\nLUDO: also ... portal ... or entrance ...\nINT: HOLE - DAY\n[HOGGLE is more depressed than ever. The peach is nowhere to be seen.\nSuddenly LUDOs head appears above.]\nLUDO: Hoggle ... all ... wet.\nHOGGLE: Aint that the clever observation, ya feeble excuse fer a\nthinkin creature!\nSARAH: Be nice, Hoggle. Or we wont get you out.\nHOGGLE: Missy!\nINT: FOREST - DAY\n[SARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO march through thick, overgrown forest. They do\nnot know that they are being spied on by JARETHS GOBLINS.]\nINT: CLEARING - DAY\n[The THREESOME emerge into a clearing and see that they have come to a\nwide fissure that goes off in either direction as far as the eye can\nsee. It is spanned by a rickety bridge held by two thick wooden posts\non either side of the gap. SARAH eyes the bridge warily.]\nSARAH: It doesnt look too strong but we dont have much choice ...\nVOICE : Halt! Halt or be slain forthwith!\n[At first they dont see a thing and look around for the source of the\nvoice. Then, the imposing 18 inch high figure of DIDYMUS, resplendent\nin rakish hat and swashbuckling sword, emerges from behind one of the\nposts and stands in front of the bridge. LUDO and SARAH are\ndumbstruck. HOGGLE, however, is not at a loss for words.]\nHOGGLE: Out of our way, ya wretched little rodent ...\nDIDYMUS looks directly at HOGGLE.\nDIDYMUS: You, sir, shall be the first to feel the point of my sword!\nSARAH: Please, we really have to cross this bridge. Its a matter of\nlife and death!\nDIDYMUS: Under any other circumstances I would hasten to oblige you,\nfair damsel, for your mission sounds a worthy one.\nSARAH: Oh, it is!\nDIDYMUS: But I am sworn. Without my permission, none may pass.\n[SARAH throws up her hands and HOGGLE mumbles under his breath. It\nappears to be up to LUDO to break the deadlock. He lifts DIDYMUS up\ninto the air and moves him to one side. They then start to walk\ntoward the bridge and DIDYMUS chases them, brandishing his sword.]\nDIDYMUS: You dishonor me, varlets! En garde!\nDIDYMUS: Rapscallions! Duel ... or die!\nThis gets their attention and they turn to look at him, annoyed.\nHOGGLE: What is this weasel babblin about?\n[It is too much for DIDYMUS. He flings himself at HOGGLE with a mighty\nwar cry. HOGGLE tries to run for it but DIDYMUS is right behind him,\nadministering more than a few pinpricks in embarrassing places.\nHOGGLE dives behind a bush and DIDYMUS sniffs at his cowardice. He\ncomes back and faces LUDO.]\nDIDYMUS: It is you I want, rogue of rogues. You who dealt me the\ngravest affront!\n[And with that he jabs LUDO in the foot! LUDO is stunned, and howling,\nbegins to hop on his good foot. DIDYMUS, his head thrown back for a\ntriumphant yell, goes after LUDO with his sword flashing and there is\nnothing for LUDO to do but pick up a branch and defend himself. It is\nthe most mismatched duel in the history of chivalrous absurdity\nDIDYMUS moving at an incredible speed, parrying the mighty swipes of\nLUDOs branch with great skill -- and no small amount of difficulty.\nAnd LUDO fending off the incessant pinpricks of the little sword,\nleaping about with surprising agility -- and at a rate that exhausts\nhim totally. Finally, the two of them, breathing heavily, lower their\nweapons. And, to everyones surprise, DIDYMUS throws down his sword.]\nDIDYMUS: I no longer wish to slay you, for you are a truly noble\nknight.\n[Then DIDYMUS strides up to him and, craning his neck, attempts to\nlook LUDO in the eyes.]\nDIDYMUS: Destroy me if you will.\n[LUDO quickly drops his branch in response. The whole thing has upset\nhis gentle nature terribly. DIDYMUS then holds out a tiny paw.]\nDIDYMUS: Never have I met my match in battle, yet you, noble knight,\nhave fought me to a standstill.\nDIDYMUS: Let us be brothers henceforth, and fight for the right as\none!\n[SARAH cheers and HOGGLE, unimpressed, rubs his sore rear. LUDO\nsmiles from ear to ear.]\nLUDO: Ludo ... get ... brother!\n[Then he and DIDYMUS exchange the ritual kiss on each cheek, which in\ntheir case is not easily accomplished. SARAH then turns practical.]\nSARAH: Well, now that thats settled lets get going.\nDIDYMUS: You forget my sacred vow, my lady. I cannot let you pass.\nSARAH: But you said Ludo was your brother! How can you refuse him?!!\nDIDYMUS: I have taken an oath. I must defend it to the death.\nHOGGLE: Some brother he turned out ta be!\nLUDO: Brother ... good!\nHOGGLE: Well, if hes so good, why wont he let us get on with our\nbusiness?\n[LUDO scratches his head. He has no idea. SARAH sits down beside the\ncrestfallen DIDYMUS.]\nSARAH: OK, lets handle this thing logically. What exactly have you\nsworn?\nDIDYMUS: I have sworn with my life-blood, no one shall pass this way\nwithout my permission.\nSARAH: Then may we ... have your permission?\n[DIDYMUS is stunned. HOGGLE and LUDO barely breathe. Slowly DIDYMUS\nlooks all around and then, with a courage greater than any he has\never had to call on before, he says it.]\nDIDYMUS: Yes.\n[And the sky doesnt fall, and the earth doesnt heave, and everything\nis exactly as it should be.]\nSARAH: Thank you.\n[DIDYMUS breathes a sigh of relief and steps aside to let them pass.\nLUDO is the first one to go over and that is unfortunate. Because the\nrickety bridge collapses under his weight. SARAH and HOGGLE jump back\non the ground near DIDYMUS just in time and poor LUDO swings over the\ndeep fissure, hanging on to one of the ropes that held the bridge.\nWith a mighty effort he hoists himself up on to the opposite side and\nlooks forlornly over at the others.]\nSARAH: Oh no!\n[SARAH crumples to the ground, and stares miserably at the broken\nbridge.]\nHOGGLE: Now see what ya done, ya mush-brained mammoth!\nDIDYMUS: I, Sir Didymus, take responsibility for the actions of my\nbrother, my lady. Lash out at me if you must.\nSARAH: Im not mad at Ludo, Sir Didymus. Im just upset because time\nis running out and I have to rescue my baby brother.\nDIDYMUS: You mean to rescue a child?!!\nSARAH: The goblin king took him, and Ive only got ...\nSARAH: ... five hours to get him back.\nDIDYMUS: Is this your quest, too, my brother?\nLUDO: Save ... baby.\nDIDYMUS: Then I shall join you, lady. I am at your service, upon my\nsword.\nSARAH: I happily accept your fealty, Sir Didymus.\nHOGGLE: This is all well an good, Missy. But we still got one little\nproblem.\nLUDO: Ludo ... friends.\nHOGGLE: Yes, yes. Were friends. Very nice. Whats that got ta do\nwith us gettin over there without a bridge?\nLUDO: Rocks ... friends.\nHOGGLE: Were wastin our time, Missy. Lets you an me go find\nanother ...\n[He is interrupted by LUDO bellowing, which is followed by a\nsympathetic rumbling. Suddenly rocks pile in from both directions\nuntil there is a pile in the fissure high enough for them to walk\nacross.]\nLUDO: Rocks ... friends!\nSARAH : They sure are, Ludo!\n[She skips happily across followed by a sullen HOGGLE. DIDYMUS\nwhistles and is quickly joined by a tail-wagging SHEEPDOG. SARAH\ngasps, he is the spitting image of her own MERLIN.]\nSARAH: Its ...\nDIDYMUS: Ambrosius! My noble steed.\nEXT: FOREST - NIGHT\n[The edge of the forest. From here you can see the castle in the\ndistance, just across the dry, cracked plain. The sky is full of\nstars. SARAH, HOGGLE, LUDO and DIDYMUS are sitting around a fire.]\nDIDYMUS: What will you do after we save the child, my lady?\nSARAH: Take him home, of course! That is, if I can figure out how.\nDIDYMUS: What is your kingdom like? Do you have many knights to\ndefend your honor?\nSARAH: Not even one.\nDIDYMUS: It cannot be! What bitter place is this that does such\ndishonor to my lady?\nSARAH: Its a place where ... where nobody really sees me.\nLUDO: Ludo ... see ... Sarah!\nSARAH: I know you do, Ludo. she turns to Didymus And\nthanks to you, Sir Didymus, I finally have a knight.\n[He bows graciously. HOGGLE, who has been watching this scene, feels\nrejected and miserable. He gets up and wanders away from the fire.\nAfter a moment, SARAH follows him.]\nSARAH: Dont you feel like resting?\nHOGGLE: I aint tired.\nSARAH: Me neither. What I am is hungry.\n[HOGGLE winces but SARAH doesnt notice. SARAH looks back at LUDO and\nDIDYMUS. LUDO lies on his back snoring loudly. DIDYMUS dozes against\nAMBROSIUS side.]\nSARAH: Theyre both wonderful, arent they?\nHOGGLE: Theyre alright.\nSARAH: Theyre more than that! Theyre loyal and strong ... and with\ntheir help Im going to beat Jareth!\nSARAH: And yours, too, of course.\nHOGGLE: I aint no fighter ...\n[She shrugs that off and wanders away to look out at the castle.\nHOGGLE goes through agony for a moment, and then makes a decision.]\nHOGGLE: Missy ... if youre hungry ...\n[He holds out the peach that JARETH gave him: the worlds most\ndelicious looking peach.]\nSARAH: Oh, great!\n[She happily taken the peach and bites. It takes everything HOGGLE has\nto not put his hands over his ears. She takes another bite and then\nstumbles.]\nSARAH : Everythings dancing ...\nSARAH: Even the stars are dancing!\n[HOGGLE turns and walks back to the fire. SARAH stumbles about as she\ngazes happily at the sky.]\nINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n[FREDDIE is leading the GOBLINS on a merry chase. He crawls around the\nroom, pulling things off shelves. A GOBLIN is on his hands and knees\nin front of JARETH polishing his boots. JARETH kicks the GOBLIN and\nsends him flying across the room. This makes FREDDIE laugh and he\npulls a book off the shelf and throws it. It hits a GOBLIN on the\nhead. JARETH scoops up FREDDIE and puts him in his cradle. He sits\ndown next to him.]\nJARETH: Little goblin-to-be, I have something to amuse you.\n[He waves his hands in front of FREDDIE and suddenly beautiful\ncrystalline balls appear in them. He runs them over his fingers like\nso many coins, their molten light so dazzling that FREDDIE kicks up\nhis legs with excitement. And WE CAN SEE that at the end of his\npajamas are two wizened goblin feet! JARETH laughs and flings the\nballs into the air and they turn into bubbles, beautiful, mesmerizing\nbubbles.]\nJARETH: Soon, little one. Very, very soon ...\n[And they both watch the bubbles as they fly out the window and over\nthe labyrinth, coldly beautiful against the darkening sky.]\nEXT: FOREST - NIGHT\n[SARAHs hand opens slowly and the half-eaten peach falls to the\nground. She stares out into the sky, mesmerized. The bubbles are\napproaching; dazzling, dancing bubbles. And then she hears music,\nhaunting, spell-casting music. The bubbles come closer and WE CAN SEE\nthat each one contains a TWIRLING DANCER, a DANCER just like the one\nin SARAHs music box. She gets up and follows them.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nHOGGLE: Damn you, Jareth! And damn\nme too!\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[A bubble, with SARAH inside it, floating through the sky. She appears\nenchanted, and she begins to twirl, just like the OTHER DANCERS.]\nEXT: BALLROOM - NIGHT\n[A giant bubble, with a magnificent ballroom inside it. Tiny bubbles\nrush to join it. In one of them is SARAH.]\nINT: BALLROOM - NIGHT\n[The music changes and now SARAH is inside the ballroom. It is a\nmagnificent spectacle with all the beauty and decadence of an 18th\nCentury Venetian ball. Magnificently dressed DANCERS swirl to the\nmusic in an incredibly opulent setting. But when you look closer you\nsense decay just beneath the surface; things are threadbare, faded.\nThe GUESTS wear masks that are elegant parodies of goblin faces,\ngiving them all a slightly sinister look. And there is something very\nprovocative about all of them; the WOMEN have bare shoulders and\ndaring decolletage, many of the MEN have their shirts open to the\nwaist. Some of them lounge against the wall indolently and there is\nthe feeling that the party has been going on all night. In this\nsetting SARAH is the picture of innocence. TWO WOMEN snickering\nbehind their fans as SARAH approaches, and she is suddenly terribly\nself-conscious. How plain She feels amidst all this! She looks into\none of the many mirrors that line the ballroom and sighs at her\nimage. Then suddenly she sees something in the mirror that makes her\ngasp.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[The mirror, and in it the reflection of a resplendent JARETH dancing\nwith a particularly exotic-looking WOMAN. SARAH whirls around, trying\nto get another glimpse of JARETH. She is so intent on trying to see\nhim that she doesnt notice that she is being stared at brazenly by a\nYOUNG MAN leaning against the wall. He moves next to her and whispers\nsomething into her ear. She hurries away, shocked; and the YOUNG MAN\nthrows back his head and laughs. And JARETH sees the whole thing.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH is approached by a MIDDLE-AGED MAN who has a box hanging at\nwaist height from a ribbon around his neck. It looks like SARAHs\nmusic box. She looks down at it with interest and he throws open the\ncover. But there is no dancer inside, instead there is a stick carved\nlike a snake. It shoots out at SARAH and she cries out and backs\naway. ALL THE PEOPLE around her laugh and she moves hurriedly on.\nJARETH, who is dancing with an even more beautiful WOMAN than before,\nwatches SARAH.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH is looking for JARETH. She spots him and sees him whisper\nsomething to his partner who smiles knowingly from beneath her mask\nand licks her lips. SARAH blushes and turns away and finds herself\nlooking into another mirror. But in the reflection, JARETH isnt with\na partner. He is standing alone, the DANCERS a whirling blur around\nhim, and he is looking straight at her. SARAH, whirling around to\nface the crowd and she sees JARETH with yet a third BEAUTY. And then\nshe realizes that it is herself! In a trance-like state she moves\nthrough the CROWD to get a better look.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAHS POV - She is whirling in JARETHs arms, and she is the most\nbeautiful woman at the ball. JARETH smiles down at her and the\nattraction between them is palpable.]\nJARETH: You look like a queen.\nSARAH: I ... I feel like ... I ... dont know what I feel ...\nJARETH : Dont you?\n[And he whirls her around dizzyingly, so dizzyingly that she swoons in\nhis arms. He catches her before she can fall very far, tightening his\ngrip around her waist.]\nSARAH: Are we ... are we in a bubble?\nJARETH: Yes, we are. A dream bubble ... where your dreams can come\ntrue.\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[OUR SARAH is being jostled by the crowd. She stumbles and almost\nfalls on top of a COUPLE on a bench. The WOMAN is sprawled across the\nlap of the MAN who wears a mask with a very phallic nose. SARAH backs\naway from them, frightened.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[JARETH and SARAH, dancing. She is smiling up at him, he has never\nlooked more handsome. There is something more open about him, as if\nhe, too, is caught up in the moment. He nuzzles her hair with his\nlips and whispers in her ear.]\nJARETH : My Queen!\n[Then he begins a song. A song that tells SARAH he will give her\neverything she wants, even things she doesnt know she wants. A song\nthat says forget it all; all the restrictions, all the powerlessness.\nForget and stay in the dream.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[OUR SARAH watches, mesmerized. But every time she tries to get closer\nto JARETH and SARAH she in jostled by a lascivious ADMIRER, pushed\nout of the way by WOMEN laughingly being chased by MEN. She stumbles\nagainst a wall and a door opens. Inside, pillow feathers are flying\nand she cant make out what the SEVERAL PEOPLE are doing. A WOMAN\ncomes up to the doorway, winks at SARAH, and closes the door.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[JARETH finishes the song and SARAH looks up at him, smiling. He moves\nhis face closer to hers and she closes her eyes. His face comes\ncloser, and closer.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[OUR SARAH shrinks back from what she is seeing. She turns and runs,\npushing herself though the languid CROWD, right into the bubble\nitself.]\nEXT: BALL - NIGHT\n[SARAH comes crashing through the bubble and the whole ballroom\ncrumbles. In seconds it resembles nothing so much as a junkyard.]\nEXT JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n[SARAH runs through the streets of a part-market, part-junkyard. There\nare piles of rubble and junk everywhere, and between them are tents\nfrom which PEOPLE hawk objects of all kinds. Some of them approach\nSARAH and she pushes them away, sobbing.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAHS POV - A RED TENT, and standing in front of it is an OLD WOMAN\nstooped over from the objects piled high on her back. She beckons to\nSARAH and pulls the tent flap aside.]\nJUNK WOMAN: Ere it is, Dearie. All the fings you want, all the fings\nyou need.\nANOTHER ANGLE\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH gasps at the sight and runs headlong into the tent. She trips\nover the threshold and lands face down on her bed.]\nINT: SARAHS ROOM - NIGHT\n[SARAH sits up on the bed and looks around the room. She shakes her\nhead and laughs.]\nSARAH: What a dream!\n[She gets up and stretches, then walks over to the mirror. She smiles\nat her reflection.]\nSARAH: Yep, youve got quite an imagination, kid, Just what a great\nactress needs.\nSARAH: How about a midnight snack, Sir Lance ...\nEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n[SARAHS POV - THE MARKET/JUNKYARD TEEMING WITH ACTIVITY.\nThe JUNK WOMAN peers in.]\nJUNK WOMAN: Avent you got everythin you need, Dearie?\nINT: SARAHS ROOM - NIGHT\nSARAH: It is just a dream!\n[She takes a deep breath and goes to the door again. She opens it very\nslowly.]\nEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n[SARAHS POV - THE SAME TEEMING ACTIVITY. The JUNK WOMAN peers in\nagain.]\nJUNK WOMAN: Best to stay in there, where its safe, Dearie. Dont\nknow what might appen to you out ere.\nINT: SARAHS ROOM - NIGHT\n[SARAH clams the door again and rushes over to the window. A GROUP OF\nREVELLERS peer in at her and laugh. She quickly pulls the curtains\nclosed and walks back to the center of the room. She stands clutching\nthe bear, then looks up at her reflection in the mirror.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAHS reflection. Herself as a very old woman, clutching a teddy\nbear.]\nOLD SARAH: Best to stay in here where its safe. Dont know what\nmight happen to you out there.\nSARAH steps back from the mirror and suddenly the floor becomes a sea\nof mud and all the objects in the room come falling down on her. As\nshe tries to rise out of the muck more objects land on and around her\nand pull her down.\nSARAH: Help! Somebody help me!\nEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n[LUDO and DIDYMUS desperately searching for SARAH, DIDYMUS riding his\nDOG.]\nINT: TAVERN TENT - NIGHT\n[HOGGLE sits at a bar, drowning his sorrows. A JUNK MAN/BARTENDER\nworks behind the bar. HOGGLE slams his cup down.]\nHOGGLE: Another!\n[The BARTENDER holds out his hand greedily. HOGGLE pulls a treasure\noff his belt and slams it on the bar. The BARTENDER pours.]\nEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\nDIDYMUS: Did you see a noble maiden pass this way?\nJUNK WOMAN: A noble maiden, eh? What would she be doin in a place\nlike this?\nDIDYMUS: Shes on a rescue mission ...\nJUNK WOMAN: A rescue mission, ha! Youre in the wrong place, for\nsure! The only fings we cares about rescuin around ere is our\nworldly goods!\n[She takes an oil lamp off her back and shines it on her sleeve for\nemphasis.]\nINT: SARAHS ROOM - NIGHT\n[SARAH is drowning in a sea of junk. She hears DIDYMUS and cries out\nhopefully.]\nSARAH: Didymus, in here! Help me!\nJUNK WOMAN: Dont worry, Dearie. I sent im away!\nJUNK WOMAN: Knew you wouldnt want to be leavin your nice fings for\nno rescue mission.\nSARAH: Oh my god! Freddie!\nJUNK WOMAN: Freddie? Is that one of them dolls over there ... or that\nnice teddy?\nSARAH: No! Hes my brother! And Ive got to save him!\nJUNK WOMAN: No you dont, Dearie. You can stay right ere with all\nyour pretty fings ...\nSARAH: I know I can. But I dont want to!\n[She lifts herself out of the junk with a mighty heave and stands in\nthe doorway. She looks down at the JUNK WOMAN triumphantly.]\nSARAH: Now get out of my way!\nEXT: JUNK CITY - NIGHT\n[The JUNK WOMAN pulls something off her own pile and holds it out to\nSARAH.]\nJUNK WOMAN: Wait, Dearie! Look at this!\n[She holds out SARAHs music box, opens it, and the little DANCER\ntwirls inside.]\nSARAH : Keep it!\n[And she is off. As SARAH goes the CAMERA LINGERS on the JUNK WOMAN.\nAnd we begin to move around to her other side and even though we had\njust seen her from all sides, we now see something very, very\ndifferent. Where the other side of the woman should be WE SEE a\ncross-section of her, with JARETH inside. His head is beneath the\npile of junk and his hand is inside her head making it laugh. He is\nthe puppeteer operating the JUNK LADY, as indeed, she has been\noperated. JARETH is mad.]\nJARETH: Damn.\nEXT: CASTLE GATE - NIGHT\n[LUDO and DIDYMUS sit forlornly at the gate. SARAH appears out of the\nnight.]\nDIDYMUS: My lady!\nLUDO: Sarah ... safe!\nDIDYMUS: Is Hoggle not with you?\nSARAH: Hoggle made his choice, hes ... not part of the mission\nanymore.\nDIDYMUS : The coward!\nLUDO: Hoggle ... good!\nSARAH: Maybe. But theres no time to discuss it. Weve got a baby to\nrescue, remember!\nEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\n[Streets full of hovels encircle the castle. This is where the GOBLINS\nlive. As SARAH, LUDO and HOGGLE walk through the dark, eerie streets\nthey are met by the slamming of shutters and the extinguishing of\nlights.]\nDIDYMUS: Methinks they are expecting us, my lady.\n[A CHILD GOBLIN peers at them from an open doorway. A FEMALE GOBLIN\nsees him and drags him inside and slams the door.]\nSARAH : Methinks youre right!\nINT: TAVERN - NIGHT\n[HOGGLE is still at it. He pulls his belt off his body and WE SEE that\nthe only treasure left is SARAHs plastic circlet. He slowly pulls it\noff and stares at it. The BARTENDER approaches, his eyes lighting up\nat the eight of this treasure.]\nBARTENDER: Another?\n[HOGGLE hesitates, then hands the circlet over. The BARTENDER bites it\nand his face lights up with glee.]\nBARTENDER: Plastic!\n[He goes to get the drink and HOGGLE puts his face down on the bar and\nsobs.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[At the other end of the bar sits the WISE ONE. The HAT looks over at\nHOGGLE and shakes his head knowingly.]\nHAT: Drinkin to forget, eh, buddy?\nWISE ONE: To forget, ah yes. To suffer a mental lapse, to obliterate\nfrom ones consciousness, to suffer amnesia, a blank or fugue, to\ndrink the waters of Lethe ...\nHOGGLE : Whats Lethe ...\nWISE ONE: The waters of forgetfulness. They remove from our minds\nwhat is too painful to remember ...\nWISE ONE: ... but with the memory goes our wisdom, or knowledge, that\nwhich brings us understanding, also enlightenment ...\n[But there is no one to continue benefitting from the WISE ONEs\npearls. HOGGLE is gone.]\nHAT: You can cool it down there ... hes gone ...\nWISE ONE: ... a grasp of things, a depth or profundity of thought ...\n[The HAT sighs and looks over at the BARTENDER who is still admiring\nhis plastic treasure.]\nHAT: Another one over here ... and make it a double ...\nEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\n[SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS emerge into the vast courtyard outside the\ncastle. It in eerily quiet. Too quiet.]\nSARAH: Were going to make it!\nDIDYMUS: I am less than sure ...\n[They are interrupted by a high-pitched shriek as a GOBLIN jumps on\nLUDOs back. Then the courtyard is filled with GOBLINS, what seems\nlike the whole army, coming right at them. DIDYMUS fends off the\nVANGUARD PARTY with his sword and LUDO punches out the ones that get\nby him. DIDYMUS unswords a GOBLIN and his weapon goes flying. SARAH\npicks it up and does some parrying of her own. But there are too many\nof them. The threesome turn and run.]\nINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n[JARETH stands by the window, watching the battle. The WHITE BIRD sits\non his shoulder. JARETH looks over at FREDDIE who stands holding on\nto the side of the cradle. JARETH smiles and turns back to the melee\nbelow. The BIRD flies out the window.]\nEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\n[SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS race down the streets. The GOBLINS are in hot\npursuit.]\nEXT: STREET - NIGHT\n[They come careening around a corner and it seems that they have\nescaped their pursuers. The sound of the GOBLINS seems to be getting\nfarther away.]\nSARAH: I think we lost them.\n[They turn and see that, unfortunately they have come full circle and\nare right back in the courtyard. LUDO climbs part way up a wall and\nlooks over the streets.]\nDIDYMUS: What do you see, my brother?\n[LUDO gulps. What he sees is the GOBLIN ARMY coming down every street\nright towards them.]\nLUDO: Ludo ... see ... trouble!\n[And then the trouble arrives and SARAH and DIDYMUS are heavily into\nswordplay. LUDO tries clumsily to get down and is tormented by\nGOBLINS who prick at him with their spears. SARAH looks up and sees\nhis predicament. She gets an idea.]\nSARAH: Call the rocks, Ludo! Call the rocks!\nEXT: GOBLIN TOWN - NIGHT\n[An enormous rumbling is heard and soon the streets are filled with\nboulders, all careening towards LUDO. They knock GOBLINS out of their\npath like so many bowling pins.]\nEXT: COURTYARD - NIGHT\n[SARAH and DIDYMUS fight bravely. LUDO keeps bellowing and throwing\noff the occasional GOBLIN that is stupid enough to jump on him. Soon\nthe rocks reach the courtyard and form a barrier between the\nTHREESOME and their ATTACKERS. LUDO reaches down and lifts SARAH and\nDIDYMUS on to the wall. They jump and disappear into the castle\nenclave.]\nINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n[A door opens in a dark part of the castle. LUDO, SARAH and DIDYMUS\nenter. They look around and quickly tip-toe down a dark corridor.\nThey turn a corner and see some GOBLINS marching their way. They duck\nout of sight.]\nEXT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n[The main entrance to the castle. TWO-GOBLIN GUARDS stand outside the\nlarge wooden doors. The results of the THREESOMEs escape can be\nheard in the distance. A FIGURE staggers out of the dark, singing\ndrunkenly. It is HOGGLE.]\nHOGGLE:  ... its so cold in the night with no gold to keep me warm\n... \nGUARD: Who goes there?\nHOGGLE  ... so cold, oh so cold ... \nGUARD 2: Dont worry about him. Hes on Jareths payroll now.\nHOGGLE: Thash right. Jareth owes me sumthin ... an Im here ta\ncollect ...\nINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n[A GROUP OF GOBLINS stand in a circle in a corridor. They torment a\ntiny, fuzzy yapping CREATURE with their nipper sticks. The CREATURE\ngets away from them and goes scurrying down the corridor. The GOBLINS\nlaugh. It turns a corner and starts yapping for all its worth.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAH, LUDO and DIDYMUS pressed against the wall, trying to not be\nnoticed. Unfortunately the little CREATURE has no sympathy for their\nplight. It stands at their feet, making a ruckus.]\nSARAH : Shut up, you little monster!\nLUDO: Nice ... thing ...\n[But the CREATURE doesnt want a pet. It sinks its teeth into LUDOs\nhand. LUDO howls.]\nDIDYMUS: I fear that this means trouble.\nSARAH: Run for it!\nINT: CORRIDOR - NIGHT\n[The THREE are running for all theyre worth. SARAH pulls the watch\nout of her pocket. It is on the 12:30.]\nSARAH: Only a half hour left! Weve got to find Freddie!\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[Yet another GROUP OF GOBLINS running right toward them. They stop in\ntheir tracks and start running in the opposite direction.]\nINT: INNER COURTYARD - NIGHT\n[The THREE come careening into the long narrow inner courtyard.\nBalconies look down on it from the floor above. Opposite them is a\nlarge ornate door. They have a lead on the GOBLINS chasing them, but\nnot for long.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[On one of the balconies a particularly repulsive little GOBLIN laughs\nsadistically. The THREE look up and see the GOBLIN with his hands on\na huge lever. He pushes it down gleefully and the floor opens up in\nfront of the THREESOME. It appears to be a bottomless pit, too wide\nto leap across. Horrified they look behind them and see the GOBLINS\ngaining on them. And theyre throwing spears! Suddenly there is a\ntriumphant yell from the balcony opposite the repulsive GOBLIN, and\nthen a FIGURE leaps off it swinging on a rope.]\nSARAH: Hoggle!\n[It certainly is! He wrestles with the hideous GOBLIN and in the\nstruggle it falls screaming into the pit. HOGGLE then grabs the lever\nand it is not a second too soon. The pursuing GOBLINS are entering\nthe courtyard.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[The floor closes and the THREE run to the door. An enraged PURSUER\naims a spear at HOGGLE. He is hit. SARAH screams as LUDO struggles\nwith the door. It wont budge and he begins to smash his body against\nit.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[A seemingly half-dead HOGGLE staggers to his feet and throws his body\non the lever. He appears to faint from the strain but the weight of\nhis body pushes the lever and the floor opens again.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[The enraged GOBLINS are stopped in their tracks by the yawning pit.\nThey hurl spears at the THREESOME but it is to no avail. LUDO smashes\ndown the door and they run in.]\nINT: JARETHS QUARTERS - NIGHT\n[SARAH, DIDYMUS, and LUDO carrying HOGGLE enter the room where we have\nseen JARETH and FREDDIE. They lock the door behind them. No one is\nthere and FREDDIEs cradle is rocking, as if someone had removed him\nonly moments before. LUDO places HOGGLE down and SARAH looks\nfeverishly around the room. She spots a door.]\nSARAH: Thats the only way he could have gone!\nSARAH: No. I have to face him alone!\nDIDYMUS: But, my lady ...\n[He is interrupted by the sound of GOBLINS in pursuit. They start\ntrying to smash down the door. LUDO runs to it and presses his body\nagainst it. HOGGLE moans and DIDYMUS and SARAH run to his side.]\nHOGGLE: I dont expect ya to fergive me, Missy, but ...\nSARAH: Forgive you for what? Saving our lives?\nHOGGLE: But, I betrayed ya, I gave ya that damned peach ...\nSARAH: Ssh! You did the only thing you could do ...\nSARAH: ... and I see you lost all your treasures in the process.\nHOGGLE: I dont care if I never sees another treasure again!\nSARAH : Here. Just in case you change your mind.\n[She slips off her mothers ring and presses it into HOGGLEs hand. He\nis overwhelmed and SARAH smiles at his pleasure.]\nHOGGLE: And Jareth said ya could never love me.\nSARAH: Jareth doesnt know everything.\nSARAH: Take care of him, Didymus.\nDIDYMUS: Ill guard the valiant Hoggle with my life!\n[The GOBLINS give the door a particularly loud smash and LUDO presses\nagainst the door even harder.]\nLUDO: Ludo ... too!\nSARAH: No maiden could have wished for nobler knights.\nESCHER ROTUNDA - NIGHT\n[SARAH enters an overwhelming room with many staircases, balconies and\ndoorways at different heights and at all kinds of strange angles that\nobviously have no relation to what we know as gravity. Her knees\nbuckling from vertigo. Then she gasps.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nJARETH: Ive been expecting you.\n[SARAH stumbles and falls into the room, ending up on the ceiling. She\ntries to adjust to being upside down.]\nSARAH: Wheres Freddie?!!!\n[She has to look down and sideways to see JARETH and it is clearly\ngrueling.]\nJARETH: Hes right there.\n[And he points to one of the stairways that juts out at a right angle\nfrom the wall. FREDDIE is climbing up the stairs happily, but from\nSARAHs point of view it looks like he will fall when he gets to the\ntop.]\nSARAH : Freddie! No!!!\n[FREDDIE gets to the top but doesnt fall, instead he ends up crawling\nup the wall. SARAH sighs with relief and closes her eyes. This sends\nher reeling and she ends up in one of the archways. She tries to\norient herself but there is no up, no down, no sideways. And the BABY\nis about to crawl off a balcony! SARAH screams and JARETH laughs. He\nbegins a song that tells SARAH she never really understood what was\ngain on. Nothing is what it appears to be, not even things like up\nand down.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[FREDDIE in the most precarious-looking situation yet, at the top of a\nstaircase. He hesitates to crawl down, and to lure him, JARETH\ncreates a ball out of thin air and throws it to the BABY. Of course,\nit bounces up. And all the while his song is taunting SARAH. She\nturns away from him and looks into the large mirror framed in the\narchway. She sees endless SARAHS. And while shes looking, the first\nreflection runs to the left, the reflection behind that to the right,\nand so on all the way down the line. And SARAHs still standing\nthere! She falls backwards and ends up standing on the floor,\nwatching FREDDIE chase his ball across the ceiling. JARETH dances on\nthe wall now as he is about to finish his song. And there is FREDDIE\non one of the balconies facing out of the rotunda. If he falls off\nthat, hell really fall! SARAH runs up the opposite wall and finds\nthat there is sheer space between her and the BABY. The only way to\nreach him is to jump. She looks at JARETH who grins at her, then at\nFREDDIE who is teetering on the edge. As JARETH comes to the end of\nthe song there is nothing to do but jump. She looks at JARETH and\ncant repress a grin of her own.]\nSARAH: Like the man said, nothing is what it appears to be!\nINT: JARETHS CHAMBERS - NIGHT\n[SARAH falls right on to a magnificent huge bed. Opposite her JARETH\nsits in a chair. FREDDIE, wrapped in a blanket, is gurgling on his\nlap. SARAH reaches into her pocket and pulls out the watch. It is a\nfew minutes before 13. JARETH stands up.]\nJARETH: Theres still time.\n[He gestures to a clock on the wall that shows the same time as her\nwatch. He places FREDDIE into a cradle and comes over to the bed. He\nlooks down at her.]\nJARETH: Besides, Im no longer interested in having a little goblin\nprince. Ive decided Id much rather have a queen.\n[He looks into her eyes for a moment. SARAH doesnt look away.\nInstead, she slowly eases herself off the bed and stands facing him.]\nSARAH : A queen? Have you chosen anyone I know.\n[She glides by him and walks to the window. JARETH chuckles\nappreciatively.]\nJARETH: Youve come a long way, little girl.\nSARAH: I certainly have.\nJARETH: Yes, I can see it in your eyes. No\none else has ever made it this far in the labyrinth, no one else has\never been worthy ...\n[He takes her hand and brings it to his lips. She smiles\ndown at him.]\nSARAH: Whats your offer.\n[JARETH stands quickly and looks at her. She certainly has come a long\nway!]\nJARETH: Why, everything ... youll rule by my side.\nSARAH: Everything? The chance to spend my life surrounded by\nrepulsive goblins ... the chance to torment innocent creatures ...\nJARETH : ... the chance to never have a care in the\nworld, to never have to do anything that you dont want to do.\nSARAH: Anything else?\nJARETH : Why, me. Of course.\n[SARAH surreptitiously eyes the clock. There is about a minute left.\nShe glides away from the window and tries to position herself closer\nto FREDDIE.]\nSARAH: And what if Im not interested?\nJARETH: Impossible. I know you, I know what you want ...\nSARAH: Well, Ive got news for you, Jareth.\nSARAH: I dont want you!\nSARAH : Why, you miserable creep!\n[JARETH has hold of her arms but she breaks away and hauls off and\npunches him in the jaw. JARETH steps back, stunned. SARAH scoops up\nthe screaming FREDDIE.]\nSARAH: How could you do this to an innocent baby?!!\nJARETH: You hit me!\nSARAH: And Id like to do more ... you, you ... !\n[She is furious and wants to hit him again badly. Since she has the\nBABY in her arms she makes do with kicking him hard in the shin.\nJARETH howls and grabs his leg.]\nSARAH: I wouldnt want you if you were the last ... goblin on earth!\n[The WHITE BIRD flies through the window and lands on SARAHs\nshoulder. JARETH puts his hands on his ears.]\nJARETH: Dont say that!\nJARETH: Look at me! How could you do this to me!\n[Before SARAHs eyes JARETH turns into an undersized, ineffective,\nsnivelling little GOBLIN. The features are those of a goblin, but\nstill recognizably JARETH.]\nINT: CASTLE - NIGHT\n[JARETHs quarters, where DIDYMUS tends HOGGLE and LUDO still blocks\nthe door.]\nJARETH : Why does everything have to happen to me!\n[They look at each other and suddenly LUDO realizes that the GOBLINS\nare no longer trying to break down the door. The THREE start to laugh.]\nHOGGLE : She did it!\nINT: JARETHS CHAMBERS - NIGHT\nJARETH: Nobody ever cares about what I want!\n[The walls and floor shake so from his pounding fists and feet that a\ncrack opens up right in front of SARAHs feet. She looks at the clock\nand the minute hand moves to the 13. She looks at FREDDIE. Theres\nnothing to do but jump into the void. The clock begins to strike.]\nSARAH: OK, Freddie. Time to go bye-bye!\nEXT: SKY - NIGHT\n[SARAH and FREDDIE spinning through the dark, starry sky. The striking\nof the clock continues.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[CLOSE ON SARAH AND FREDDIE. SARAH pulls him closer, lovingly. And\nthey go on spinning.]\nINT: NURSERY - NIGHT\n[SARAH is lying face down on the floor. She comes to slowly and tries\nto sit up. Groaning, she rubs her head where it bumped on the corner\nof the open drawer. She tries to focus, blinking her eyes.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAHS POV - Her eyes slowly focus on FREDDIEs crib. When she can\nsee, she gasps. FREDDIEs not there! The side of the crib is down and\nthe BABY is nowhere to be seen.]\nSARAH: Freddie!\n[She leaps to her feet woozily. Still rubbing her head she staggers\nout into the hallway.]\nINT: RAILWAY - NIGHT\n[SARAH looks down the hallway and suddenly her face breaks out into a\ndelighted grin.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\n[SARAHS POV - LITTLE FREDDIE is crawling slowly, but determinedly,\ninto SARAHs room. When he gets to her bed he uses all his strength\nto pull himself up on to his feet by holding on to the bedspread. Be\nthen holds his hand out, trying to reach something.]\nANOTHER ANGLE\nINT: SARAHS ROOM - NIGHT\nSARAH : Thats quite a journey you took, Freddie.\n[FREDDIE looks up at her and makes a sound. He continues straining,\nand WE SEE that what he is reaching for is Lancelot, SARAHs bear.\nSARAH smiles, and lifts FREDDIE up. She sits on the bed, FREDDIE on\nher lap, and hands him the bear.]\nSARAH: Here. Its yours.\nSARAH : You earned it.\n[She kisses his head and rocks him gently. Then she gazes out the\nwindow at the stars.]\nEXT: HOUSE - NIGHT\n[The light shines from SARAHs window. The WHITE BIRD flutters down\nfrom the starry sky. It perches in the tree beside the path.]\nTHE END", "Im just a rock star stabbing away\nIll take the, Ill take the leave for another day\nA modern scholar, just let me know if I sing too much\nWhen youre head over heals and the magic is there\nBut impossible\nPossible\nImpossible\nAnd when the police take me away\nPossible\nImpossible\nIt wasnt you it was mothers day\nLets get this show on the road\nLets get Atomica\nLets rock till we explode\nLets get Atomica\nThey protect you from the voices\nProtect from the visions\nProtect you from the silence for another day\nThese modern people sure know how to live\nWhen youre head over heels and the magic is gone\nIts impossible\nImpossible\nImpossible\nImpossible\nThat we should swim in a covered up pool\nImpossible\nImpossible\nBy the white trees dressed in purple tulle\nLets get this show on the road\nLets get Atomica\nLets rock till we explode\nLets get Atomica\nI hold myself like a god\nLike a god\nI hold myself like a god\nLike a god\nI hold myself like a god\nLike a god\nI hold myself like a god\nLike a god\nLike\nIm just a pop star jumping away\nI leave the, I leave the sins for another day\nA little puny, and just let me know, if I talk too much\nWhen youre head over heels and the magic is there\nBut impossible\nImpossible\nImpossible\nThat we should swim in a covered up pool\nImpossible\nImpossible\nBy the white trees dressed in purple tulle\nLets get this show on the road\nLets get Atomica\nLets rock till we explode\nLets get Atomica\nLets get this show on the road\nLets get Atomica\nLets rock till we explode\nLets get Atomica", "The televisions on and Im walking through the yard\nThe house is fast asleep and Im crying in my car\nDying for the weekend\nThe kids are alright but they dont smile much\nThey sit up in their garage with their decks and their stuff\nDying for the weekend\nThe boys on a charge but his mother doesnt know\nI never got around yet to telling her so\nIt would only make her crazy\nAnd Ill be fine\nIm only sleeping in my head\nAnd I can fly\nI close my eyes and I can fly\nThe televisions on and Im walking through the yard\nThe house is fast asleep and Im crying in my car\nDying for the weekend\nThe kids have got a gig in an all night rave\nTheyre lookin pretty tough but I still want to say\nDo you really have to go?\nDown in the back street a skinny kid cries\nBad drive Saturday another life flies\nDying for the weekend\nAnd Ill be fine\nIm only sleeping in my head\nAnd I can fly\nI close my eyes and I can fly\nAnd I can fly\nAnd fall toward the end\nAnd I can fly\nAnd Ill be fine\nIm only sleeping in my head\nAnd I can fly\nI close my eyes and I can fly", "I, I wish I could swim\nJust like a dolphin, like dolphins can swim\nAnd nothing, is going to keep us together\nAnd we can beat them, for ever and ever\nBecause we can be Heroes, just for one day\nI, I will be king\nAnd you, youre going to be my queen\nYeah but nothing, is going to drive us away\n \nBecause we can be Heroes, just for one day\nI, I can remember \nWhen I was standing, by the wall \nAnd then the guns, they shot over our heads \nAnd then we kissed, as though nothing could fall \nWell then the shame, yeah, the shame was on their side\nBut were going to beat them, for ever and ever\n \nBecause we can be Heroes, just for one day\nWere nothing, and nothing will help us\nMaybe were lying, then you better not stay\nBut we could be safer, just for one day\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, just for one day\nThough nothing, will keep us together\nWe could steal time, just for one day\nWe can be Heroes, for ever and ever\nWhat dyou say?", "Grown inside a plastic box\nMicro thoughts and safety locks\nHearts become outdated clocks\nTicking in your mind\nNow its time to close our eyes\nNow its time to say goodbye\nNow its time to face the lie\nThat wed never cry\nWhats really happening?\nWhat tore us apart?\nWhats really happening?\nWhats really happening?\nWhat tore us apart?\nWhats really happening?\nAll the clouds are made of glass\nAnd theyre slowly sinking\nFalling like the shattered past\nWere we built to last?\nWhats really happening?\nWhat tore us apart?\nWhats really happening?\nWhats really happening?\nWhat tore us apart?\nWhats really happening?\nNow its time to close our eyes\nNow its time to say goodbye\nNow its time to face the lie\nThat wed never cry\nWhats really happening?\nWhat tore us apart?\nWhats really happening?\nWhats really happening?\nWhat tore us apart?\nWhats really happening?", "Ramona is so cold.

I was so pleased that I had to sit down and type an immediate reply, even though Ken is shouting at me to get on with a script he badly needs. That can wiat .\nIve been waiting for some reaction to the album from American listeners. There were reviews in Billboard and Cash Box, but they were by professional critics and they rarely reflect the opinions of the public. The critics were very flattering however. They even liked the single Love You Till Tuesday. Ive got a copy of the American album and theyve printed the picture a little yellow. Im really not that blond. I think the picture on the back is more me. Hope you like those enclosed.\nIn answer to your questions, my real name is David Jones and I dont have to tell you why I changed it. Nobodys going to make a monkey out of you said my manager. My birthday is January 8th and I guess Im 510. There is a Fan Club here in England, but if things go well in the States then well have one there I suppose. Its a little early to even think about it.\nI hope one day to get to America. My manager tells me lots about it as he has been there many times with other acts he manages. I was watching an old film on TV the other night called No Down Payment a great film, but rather depressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way Of Life. However, shortly after that they showed a documentary about Robert Frost the American poet, filmed mainly at his home in Vermont, and that evened the score. I am sure that that is nearer the real America. I made my first movie last week. Just a fifteen minutes short, but it gave me some good experience for a full length deal I have starting in January.\nThankyou for being so kind as to write to me and do please write again and let me know some more about yourself.\nYours sincerely,\nDavid Bowie", "Columbine my frail design\nI see you see me standing on my own\nIs it you that Im walking through\nShould I retrace my point of view\nIm left in clouded dreams of finding who\nNot Columbine\nJust incase youre my disguise\nI found yourself to my surprise\nIm on the ground\nAnd its Harlequin who fix me up\nWho catches you\nWho wanishes me\nFrom finding who\nYou are", "My death waits like an old roué\nSo confident Ill go his way\nWhistle to him and the passing time\nMy death waits like a bible truth\nAt the funeral of my youth\nWe drank for that and the passing time\nMy death waits like a witch at night\nAs surely as our love is bright\nLets not think of that or the passing time\nBut whatever lies behind the door\nThere is nothing much to do\nAngel or devil, I dont care\nFor, in front of that door\nThere is you\nMy death waits like a beggar blind\nWho sees the world through an unlit mind\nThrow him a dime for the passing time\nMy death waits to allow my friends\nA few good times before it ends\nAh lets not think about the passing time\nMy death waits there between your thighs\nYour cool fingers will close my eyes\nLets not think about the passing time\nBut what ever lies behind the door\nThere is nothing much to do\nAngel or devil, I dont care\nFor in front of that door\nThere is you\nMy death waits there, among the leaves\nIn magicians mysterious sleeves\nRabbits and dogs and the passing time\nMy death waits there among the flowers\nWhere the blackest shadow cowers\nSo lets pick lilacs for the passing time\nMy death waits there, in a double bed\nSails of oblivion at my head\nLets not think about the passing time\nBut whatever lies behind the door\nThere is nothing much to do\nAngel or devil, I dont care\nFor, in front of that door\nThere is you", "Yo, VIP, lets kick it\nIce Ice Baby\nIce Ice Baby\nAlright stop, collaborate and listen\nIce is back with my brand new invention\nSomething grabs a hold of me tightly\nFlow like a harpoon daily and nightly\nWill it ever stop?

the dog\nOh, Its the madness in his eyes\nAs he breaks the nights to cry:\nIts really me!\nReally you and really me!\nIts so hard for us to really be ...\nReally you and really me\nYoull lose me, though Im always\nReally free!\nAnd the mountain moved its eyes\nTo the world of realize\nWhere the snow had saved a place\nFor the wild eyed boy from Freecloud\nAnd the village dreadful cried\nAs the rope began to rise\nFor the smile stayed on the face\nOf the wild eyed boy from Freecloud\nAnd the women once proud\nClutched the heart of the crowd\nAs the boulders smashed down\nFrom the mountains hand\nAnd the magic in the stare\nOf the wild eyed boy said\nStop, Freecloud;\nThey wont think to cut me down\nNo, no, no\nBut the cottages fell\nLike a playing card hell\nAnd the tears on the face\nOf the wise boy\nCame tumbling down\nTo the rumbling ground\nAnd the missionary mystic of peace-love\nStumbled back to cry among the clouds\nKicking back the pebbles\nFrom the Freecloud mountain

Code, §§ 1750-1784, and other consumer protection laws.\nThe arbitration provision allowed an appeal to a three-member panel of a monetary award exceeding $100,000, allowed appeal of an award of injunctive reliеf, required advance paymеnt of arbitral expenses on appeal, and exempted repossession from arbitration. The buyer stated in his declaration that he was not given an opportunity to read the contract and was not aware that it had an arbitration provision on the reverse side. The ADA defense lawyer court concluded that the arbitration provision was unconscionable under Civ. Code, § 1670.5, and could not be cured by severance. Thus, its enforcement was properly refused under Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1281, 1281.2. The arbitration provision satisfied the two elements of procedural unconscionability, oppression and surprise, because the contract was one of adhesion and the buyer was not given an opportunity to read the provision. It was also substantively unconscionable because multiple aspects of the arbitration provision tilted it decidedly in favor of the dealer and caused it to be permeated by unconscionability. Moreover, injunctive relief from the arbitrator was inconsistent with the CLRA. Some of the offending clauses could not be cured by striking them.\nThe court affirmed the order.\nPetitioner investors petitioned for a writ of mandate directing respondent trial court to set aside its order denying their motions to restore their lawsuit against real party in interest securities dealers alleging negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and conversion to the active civil trial calendar. The California Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Seven, denied the petition. The investors petitioned for review.\nThe National Association of Securities Dealers was a self-regulatory organization that licensed and regulated broker-dealers in the national securities industry. Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NASD had adopted a code of arbitration procedure to govern the arbitration of disputes between its members and their customers. The Securities and Exchange Commission had approved NASDs procedures. The court held that Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1281.85 authorized the California Judicial Council to adopt ethics standards for arbitrators appointed by arbitration providers, but it also held also that the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 preempted § 1281.85 and the California Ethics Standards for Neutral Arbitrators in Contractual Arbitration for arbitrations administered by the subsidiary. In determining that the NASD Code should preempt the California Standards, the SEC acted within its authority, and its determination was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable. A delay in arbitrator selection and appointment, resulting from uncertainty regarding the applicability of the California Standards, did not relieve the investors of their duty to arbitrate.\nThe appellate courts judgment was affirmed.", "Question-time that says I brought dishonour\nMy heads bowed in shame\nIt seems that Ive blackened the family name\nMother says that she cant stand the

Some of their shipments were made on government bills of lading; others were made on commercial bills of lading. Plaintiffs reported the gross receipts from their government contracts to defendant city, but excluded the receipts attributable to property shipped outside the state by bills of lading. Defendant assessed tax deficiencies, Riverside employment lawyers plaintiffs paid. Plaintiffs then brought complaints for refunds. The court reversed the trial courts order in favor of defendant. Plaintiffs were taxable on their gross receipts under Los Angeles Business Tax Ordinance §§ 21.166, 21.167, not under Los Angeles Business Tax Ordinance § 21.190, as defendant asserted; plaintiffs processes of sale and service were commercially inseparable and could not be assessed separately. Plaintiffs were taxable on gross receipts for shipments on government bills of lading. These were not exempted by Los Angeles Business Tax Ordinance § 21.168.1, as were those shipments made on commercial bills of lading.\nThe court reversed the judgment for defendant city, holding that plaintiff taxpayers could be taxed on their gross receipts from government contracts but that they were not taxable under the higher rate of a catch-all ordinance provision. The court also held plaintiffs liable for gross receipts attributable to shipments to points outside the state on government bills of lading, but not on commercial bills of lading.\nPlaintiff brought an action charging defendant and others with violating the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act , Civ. Code, § 3426, et seq., by misappropriating certain trade secrets belonging to plaintiff. The Superior Court of Santa Clara County, California, dismissed the complaint. Plaintiff petitioned for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its order of dismissal and to permit the matter to proceed to trial.\nNot long after filing suit, plaintiff went through bankruptcy proceedings, selling its rights in the alleged trade secrets, while reserving its rights of action for misappropriation commencing before the date of the transfer. Despite the efforts by defendants counsel to conjure up a current ownership rule, the court found no support for such a rule in the text of the California Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civ. Code, § 3426, et seq., cases applying it, or legislative history. Nor did the court find any evidence of such a rule in patent or copyright law, which defendants cited by analogy. Defendants offered no persuasive argument from policy for the courts adoption of such a rule. Although there might be situations where a suit by a former owner raised concerns about the rights of absent parties, or a risk of multiple or inconsistent liabilities on the part of parties before the court, the remedy for such concerns rested in Californias liberal and highly flexible procedures for the permissive or compulsory joinder of parties. Because plaintiffs sale of the trade secrets was not an impediment to its maintenance of its action, the trial court erred by dismissing the complaint.\nThe court issued a peremptory writ of mandate directing the trial court to set aside its order dismissing plaintiffs claims, and to proceed with their adjudication in a manner consistent with the courts opinion.", "Oh; oh:\nTo the left, see him in the trees\nTo the left;\nTo the left, I see him in the trees\nTo the left\nI see him in the trees\nTo the left, to the left\nDid you hear?\nBye-bye Spaceboy\nYoure sleepy now\nYour silhouette\nSo stationary\nYoure released but your custody calls\nAnd I want to be free\nDont you want to be free?\nDo you like girls or boys ...\nIts confusing these days\nMoondust will cover you, cover you\nThis chaos is killing me, oh-oh\nBye-bye love\nBye-bye love\nBye-bye love, oh yeah\nBye-bye love, oh yeah\nThis chaos is killing me\nHallo Spaceboy\nYoure sleepy now\nYour silhouette\nSo stationary\nYoure released but your custody calls\nAnd I want to be free\nDont you want to be free\nDo you like girls or boys ...\nIts confusing these days\nBut moondust will cover you, cover you\nThis chaos is killing me!\nMoondust\nBye-bye love\nBye-bye love, ooooh yea\nBye-bye love, oh no\nBye-bye love, oh no\nTell me\nThis chaos is killing me\nThis chaos is killing me\nBye-bye love\nBye-bye love\nGood time love\nSweet sweet dove\nBye-bye Spaceboy\nOooh yeah\nBye-bye love\nOh-oh\nMoondust will cover you\nMoondust will cover you\nMoondust will cover you\nMoondust will cover you!"]}
