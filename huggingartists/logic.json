now? What advice can you give me?\nGod: What advice can I give humanity?\nAtom: I suppose so\nGod: Live your life. Don’t waste your days on the negative energy of others. Remember that you’re not your salary. You’re not your house. You’re not your car. And no matter how big your bank account is, your grave is six feet under just like everyone else’s. So enjoy the days you have. Worry not about the days that came before you. Nor the ones that will follow you in death. Remember that right here in this moment is all you are guaranteed, and the fact that you are living is what life is all about. So live your life to the fullest, according to your happiness and the betterment of all\nKai: Damn man, we’ve been walking forever\nThomas: Well, Thalias tracking system says we’ll be there in just over an hour\nKai: Shit, at least we got good walking music or is that it?\nThomas: Oh no, man.

way back to about 1990\nShady Grove Hospital in Rockville, Maryland\n7:36 a.m., where a biracial baby was born\nTo a black father and a white mother\nFather that wasn’t there\nAddicted to crack cocaine, alcohol, and various other drugs\nSame as his mom\nSo I’m gonna tell you about that, right?\nAnd I’m gonna tell you about how\nAll this young boy ever wanted was happiness\nAll he ever wanted was positivity\nAll he ever wanted to do was entertain\nAnd this boy went through hell\nYou gotta understand, his mother was racist, which is crazy\nCause how in the fuck is you gonna have\nAll these black babies with black men but you racist\nLike bitch, that don’t make no sense, but it is what it is\nYou know, he grew up, her callin him a nigger\nThe kids at school callin him a cracker\nIdentifying as black, looking as white\nBeing told what you can or can’t be\nThis kid went through everything\nHe went through...\nHe saw narcotics in the household\nViolence, murderers, drug dealers, he was kidnapped\nThere was crazy shit that happened to this kid\nAnd he persevered while the whole world said\nWhat they said?\nSaid you wouldn’t be shit!\nYou ain’t gon be nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin\nNothin, nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin, nothing\nAnd I, and he, he said fuck that, I’ma persevere\nAnd that’s why the message is always peace, love and positivity\nSee, he always saw things from two sides\nHe always saw things from two sides\nHe always knew that the message\nEverybody was born equal\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\nHe knew that because he saw that\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way)\nBecause he was stripped and torn down\nBy his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated\nAnd that did not know\nAnd he was stripped and he was torn down\nBy his white side that did not know\nThese people that are ignorant\nThat cannot see the bigger picture\nThat must fight and kill and murder each other\nBut once again, all he ever wanted to do\nWas spread a message of equality\nFor every man, woman, and child\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nNow imagine this child growing up\nAnd seeing the craziest shit\nBeing a part of the craziest shit\nRunning around with the wrong people\nRunning around with guns and knives\nAnd fighting and stealing and, and all this\nBecause he didn’t know, he didn’t know!\nBut he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn’t right\nAnd he knew that he needed to get away from it\nNow I want you to also imagine, that at 17 years old\nThis child, okay, leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself\nTwo jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings\nAnd then he would then come home\nTo about eight or nine hours of sleep\nBut spend four, five, six hours of that\nWorking on music, persevering\nGrabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror\nAnd pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people\nJust chanting his name\nHoping that it would happen\nBut the, but the, but the world said no!\nMothafucka, little mothafucka no-no, no-no, no-no, no-no\nYa nigga, ya cracka, ya white boy, ya black mothafucka\nNo-no!\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first)\nAnd he said fuck that\nHe said peace, love, and positivity\nHe said equality for all man\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation, yeah\nNow I want you to also imagine\nPeople telling him that he did not live this life\n“You just a white boy\nYou ain’t never experienced that shit\nYou from Gaithersburg, Maryland, nothing happens there\nOh no, no, we know, we weren’t there\nWe didn’t live with you, we didnt live in your Section 8 household\nWe didn’t live with the narcotics and violence in your household\nWe just saw it from the outside, outside, outside, outside\nOutside, outside, outside, outside\nAnd since you white, you gotta have money, right?”\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first black man)\nAnd this young man persevered in spite\nOf what people told him he was, wasn’t, and would never be\n(Take it back, take it way back\nTake it way, way back to the first black)\nAnd that man is here today, proud\nA lover of all human beings\nRegardless of race, religion, color, creed, sexual orientation, yeah, yeah\nAnd he’s here to say:\nEven though we’re all born and created equal\nWe are not treated equally\nThere’s extremists on every side\nAnd you should just do your best to live life\nAnd let other people believe whatever they wanna believe\nAs long as they’re not hurtin anybody\nYou can believe they’re going to hell\nYou can believe it’s not right\nYou can

remember somehow, someway\nI remember somehow, someway\nI remember somehow, someway\nI remember somehow, someway\nIt was December of 2015 in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood\nI stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars\nWhen suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic\nAs my body began to fade\nIn this moment my mind was full of clarity\nBut my body insisted it was in danger\nI looked around and I told myself I was safe, I was fine\nBut I was convinced that something was wrong\nBefore I knew it I felt as though I was going to\nFall and fade away\nMy body grew weak\nAnd soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety\nI refused to believe this story\nI searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me\nI began to feel detached from reality\nI felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass\nI got blood work done\nAnalysis of my mind and body to no avail\nThe doctor said it was anxiety\nBut how could it be anxiety?\nHow could anxiety make me physically feel off balance?\nHow could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death?\nDerealization\nThe sense of being out of one’s body\nI’m not here\nI’m not me\nI’m not real\nNothing is\nNothing but this feeling of panic\nNobody understands\nNobody knows the sufferings\nThis physical feeling\nIt can’t be anxiety\nIt can’t\nOr can it?\nCan it in fact be the mind controlling the body?\nYeah, of course\nI’m so in control of my mind and my body\nBut I’m subconsciously forcing myself into a state\nOf self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind\nI am unhappy\nNot with life\nBut with this feeling\nI am scared, I am human, I am a man\nBut I look in the mirror and I see a child\nI am an adult who recognize grown ups don’t really know shit\nAnd they never did\nAnd it scares me\nCause now I’m just a grown up who doesn’t know shit\nBut one thing is I do know this feeling, this horrible feeling is going to kill me\nNo, no this feeling\nThis anxiety is nothing\nI have anxiety\nJust like you, the person I wrote this for\nAnd together we will overcome this feeling\nWe will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge\nThat we are alive\nAnd any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted\nWe will rejoice in this gift that is life\nWe will rejoice in this day that we have been given\nWe will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves\nStarting with mental health\nWe will accept ourselves as we are\nAnd we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror\nWe will accept ourselves\nAnd live with anxiety32Embed", "Wu Tang Forever Lyrics\nEn

you would, said you could, but you aint got the skill\nYou gotta climb the highest mountain to master the hill\nYou gotta climb over your ego to master your will\nGave up on your dreams for a suit and a pension\nGod damn, I hope youre here for the intervention\nYou say you would if you had the money\nDont make me mention\nIt dont cost nothin but time for you to pay attention\nNow dont get me

success is prone to collision\nAnd every now and then something happens thats unexpected\nLike that newborn in your life cause you was fuckin unprotected\nAnd I swear nobody perfect, hell, I know I aint\nYeah I know this verse is heaven sent but Im far from a saint\nLive a life with no complaints, tryna do just what I can\nLearn from my fathers mistakes and become a better man\nNow plant a seed

Understand, All good? Lets get it then \nOnce they touched down nobody could hear a sound\nTil they opened up the ship door, that rappelled to the ground\nWhat they found, a planet full of life\nA planet full of shit they never seen\nStraight up out a movie scene\nOn some Tarantino meets Christopher Nolan, nah mean?\nWalk around the planet for hours, they was exhausted\nIf it wasnt for the music in they ears, they would have lost it\nThe seventh album by a musician they both revered\nFirst time this planet heard it, lets call it a world premiere\nThomas thinkin about a picture of his girl\nThat he left on the Aquarius Three in his dresser\nWishin he could undress her\nGive her the pipe, no lesser\nKai thinkin nuts like a professor\nWondering if the oxygen on this planet fresher\nNow is it us or is the natural life on this world the aggressor?\nAll the negative shit inside of his head, he need a refresher\nTwo men here to save the world, no pressure40Embed", "Everybody Dies Lyrics\nYeah, fuck that

would have thought that painting pictures ’bout being broke\nWould get me riches like dealing coke?\nLike big brother used to do so we could stay afloat\nI heard them guns outside my window, them gangsters would tote\nThought about the life I wanted, picked up the pen and then wrote\nWhile they was firing, you could hear sirens\nFrom people dialing 911 crying in the phone\nI was in the zone, trying to make a living\nHeading to work in the morning\nEveryday felt like I was mourning, as my dream was deceased\nUntil I quit my job, then my work ethic increased\nElevated to levels I ain’t ever seen\nStacking this cream, living the American dream now\nI’m going crazy, I ain’t slept in days\nDreaming of Michael Jordan money like I slept in J’s\nAlways shouting out my team ’cause I get all the praise\nBut they the ones that motivate me on depressing days\nSee I’m from Maryland where cats draw gats like animation\nFrom the smallest altercation, that can lead to termination\nWith a rapper on every corner, like the rest of the nation\nPassing bars back and forth like legal examinations\nAs a youngin I was running wild\nMe and my homies skipping school, puffing on that loud\nDoing shit just to do it, ’cause we wasn’t allowed\nI thought I understood the world, but I was still a child, yeah\nNow when my mama was at home drinking, thinking ’bout the bills\nI was dreaming ’bout the mills, running round looking for thrills\nI guess this is how it feels when your memory spills onto the page\nAnd paints a picture of another age\nBack in West Deer Park, chilling with shorties after dark\n‘Cause when the sun is down, the police always want us down\n‘Til we get older and hustle, now they try’na gun us down\nWe just trying to make a living off of what we’ve been given\nWassup\nWalk on by\nWalk on by\nWalk on\nThey call me Logic, yeah that’s L-O-G-I-C\nI ain’t wrapped up in them bitches, I just write ’bout shit I see\n‘Cause these lyrics set me free, fuck the world, let me be\nAnd when I feel like I can’t write, that’s when I hit the MPC\nMy talent limitless, but time is limited so listen up\nIf you can’t see the shit I see, you better get your vision up\nI’m the king, watch me reign, born to rule my domain\nAlbum ain’t even in stores, they tryna sue me for my name\nShit insane, so berserk, never complained, I just work\nChasing after my dreams like them high school skirts\nBack as a youngin, spitting game, tryna get the nut in\nLiving life to the fullest ’cause them little things ain’t nothing\nMy flow unkillable when I be murdering syllables\nBut I take my time, slow it down, check the rhyme\nPerfectionist to the dime, from the womb to the tomb\nI be rapping ’til I’m dying, doing everything I love\nThat’s the life of a don, skipping school, sipping liquor\nTryna get this money quicker, bad bitches, good weed\nThat’s the type of shit I need\nLyrics bleed from my mind state\nElevate my mind and watch it rise like the crime rate\n‘Cause sometimes I be high, and sometimes I be low\nAnd sometimes I do shit I thought Id never do before\nMy life is like a movie role that’s starring me, got these women on me\nI hit the club with all my homies, and the drinks is on me\nAt the crib with the shorty that I met at the spot\nPretty eyes, nice lips, Grey Goose what she sips\nBoth my hands on her hips, ’til she put em on her tits\nFreak bitch want the dick, biting on her finger tip\nI only fuck with nice girls, I never do this type of shit\nI’m thinking ’bout hitting it raw, shit I must be wildin out\nBut that pussy wet as hell, I think it’s time to end the drought\nThen again she could be burning, and that’s not what I’m about\nSo I dipped out, to live another day and die another night\n‘Cause when I’m gone that ain’t gon be the song that

changed in the last year\nAt parties with legends like What the fuck I’m doing here?\nWaiting for someone to say What the fuck you doing here?\nUntil I realized I belonged and had nothing to fear\nWho would’ve thought I would mingle with celebrity singles\nIn a room full of Grammy winners discussing they singles\nSome people love you, some people hate you\nSome people need you, some people act like they know you\nBut they can’t even read you\nThe effort I put into music is still the same amount\nCause aint a damn thing changed except the bank account\nI remember the day I got my advance money\nI’m talkin so much bread, this shitll make you dance money\nWhats the first thing I did?\nGot my team out the way and then I got myself a crib\nMy boy Lenny gave me a place to stay for a year\nPut food in my stomach, I had nothing to fear\nAnd once that 365 was up, I told him to quit his job\nAnd gave him a new career\nSo many rappers on that stupid superstar shit\nBut I plan to eat with the people I starved with\nI’ve made money, I’ve lost money, I’ve spent money\nIve slept outside due to lack of the rent money\nI’ve been in love, been happy, been through a lot of pain\nCause what the fuck is sunshine without a little rain?\nAnd love is like leaves in the fall\nCause some people get scared and leave when you fall\nSpeaking of which, I met this girl the other day\nThe type of girl that make the pain fade away\nAnd I have a feeling she gon be my next\nCause she make me forget all about my ex\nI’m talking something that’s deeper than just sex\nBut I don’t want her to be the third letter in the word next\nOld soul in the sea of love\nI’m just not current, none of the above\nAnd man, fuck all that depressing shit\nLet’s get this money and fuck these bitches\nYou know what I’m sayin?\nSike, nah, all of yall just know that I’m playin\nCause all the money you possess ain’t what makes you a man\nBig shot, tough guy, blow 100 grand\nBut you still in the same place, damn\nBut man, the world is so fascinating\nAmbition got these girls gravitating\nAnd honestly, it strokes the ego\nBut beautiful women ain’t good for nothing\nExcept procrastinating\nI got a show in Paris coming up\nFollowed by London, Ima tear it up\nSo many people just don’t care enough\nAnalyzing faces in the crowd staring up\nWhats the difference between me and them?\nHow come I ain’t in the crowd at they show seeing them\nWhat that guy see in me that he ain’t see in him?\nCause honestly I see no difference between me and him\nWe all people, all equal, we all the same?\nLookin for control tryna play the game\nWe all got issues, just different magazines\nWe all sleep but have different dreams\nHowever, once you’re awake and your life ain’t what it seems\nAnd that’s the reason I’m living within my own dream\nHell yeah, fuck em all like I’m runnin from the law\nHaters probably think they phase me, I’m like no, not at all\nI’m too high up, now to fall\nLike a sphere, bitch I ball\nNever asked me where my team at\nCause you know I brought em all\nAnd if you’re looking for a problem then we can get it solved\nI just kill them with kindness, keep it peace and it dissolve\nYou got bitches, I got Bobby Soxer girls that be ride or die\nA shawty on another level, let me catch a vibe\nSuper bad girl, IQ is in the sky\nShe graduated cum laude, your bitch went to DeVry\nGod damn, oh girl, she a go getta\nAt the party takin shots like a Beretta\nDoing anything and everything to feel better\nAnd now she in the crib getting high like a falsetto\nHow you feeling, I be yelling\nWhy these motherfuckers grilling?\nAnd she give me life ‘cause I’m making a killing\nBring it down, do it slow, show me how that really go\nGirl I’m new in town, I don’t really know\nThey be like, when you gonna tell me that you love me?\nI be like, Bitch I gotta hit the studio, ho\nNow she got me on the crib, talkin that she wanna do it\nCondom on the dresser looking at me like aint nothing to it\nThinking should I do it though, I dont even know the ho\nI dont even know the ho, I dont even know the ho\nSayin, Ohh, mama I made it\nOhh, mama, I made it\nYou cannot tell me no\nBut the young

latina\nHer demeanor was unexplainable, you shoulda seen her\nThick thighs, nice ass\nBody like an hourglass\nDidn’t hesitate to break a brother neck\nSecond, she passed I was like, “What’s up?”\nTo which she replied, “How you doin’?”\nI said, De nada momma but your beauty I’m pursuin’\nAnd I said I’m about to win the lottery\nShe asks “How?”\nI said, “Your seven digits right now” and made her

debt\nTo live in freedom without fighting slavery\nTo profiteer\nI have met Southerners who expect and fear a Negro insurrection\nI see no purpose in withholding this from general discussion\nThere may be those within that outcast ten percent of the American people who someday will strike back at their oppressors\nBut to put down that mob, a mob would rise\nId like to ask, please: who will put down that mob?\nIm an overpaid producer with pleasant reasons to rejoice, and I do\nIn the wholesome practicability of the profit system\nBut surely, my right to having more than enough is cancelled\nIf I dont use that more to help those who have less\nI owe the very profit I make to the people I make it from\nIf this is radicalism, it comes automatically to most of us in show business\nIt being generally agreed that any public man owes his position to the public\nThats what I mean when I say Im your obedient servant\nWe must, each day, earn what we own\nA healthy man owes to the sick all that he can do for them\nAn educated man owes to the ignorant all that he can do for them\nA free man owes to the worlds slaves all that he can do for them\nAnd what is to be done is more, much more, than good works\nChristmas baskets, bonuses and tips, and bread and circuses\nThere is only one thing to be done with slaves\nFree them\nIf we cant die in behalf of progress, we can live for it\nProgress, we Americans take to mean, a fuller realization of democracy\nThe measure of progress, as we understand it, is the measure of equality enjoyed by all men\nWe can do something about that\nThe way our fighting brothers and sisters looked at it\nSome of them dead as I speak these words\nThe way they looked at it, were lucky\nAnd theyre right, were lucky to be alive\nBut only if our lives make life itself worth dying for\nWe must be worthy of our luck or we are damned\nOur lives were spared, but this is merely the silliest of accidents\nUnless we put the gift of life to the hard employments of justice\nIf we waste that gift, we wont have anywhere to hide from the indignation of history\nI want to say this\nThe morality of the auction block is out of date\nThere is no room in the American century for Jim Crow\nTomorrows democracy discriminates against discrimination\nIts charter wont include the freedom to end freedom\nRace hate isnt human nature, race hate is the abandonment of human nature\nBut this is true\nThere are alibis for the phenomenal excuses, economic and social\nBut the brutal fact is simply this\nWhere the racist lies acceptable, there is corruption\nThe race haters must be stopped, the lynchings must be stopped\nThe murders must be avenged\nI come in that boys name and in the name of all, who, in this land of ours, have no voice of their own\nI come with a call for action\nThis is the time for it\nI call for action against the cause of riot\nIt wont surprise me if Im accused in some quarters of inciting to riot\nWell, Im very interested in riots, Im very interested in avoiding them\nSo I call for action against the cause of riots\nLaw is the best action, the most decisive\nIts in the peoples power to see to it that what makes lynchings and starts wars is dealt with\nNot by well-wishers, but by policemen, and I mean good policemen\nOver several generations, maybe therell be men who cant be weaned away from the fascist vices of race hate\nBut we should deny such men responsibility in public affairs\nExactly as we deny responsibility to the wretched victims of the drug habit\nThere are laws against peddling dope\nThere can be laws against peddling race hate\nBut every man has the right to his own opinion as an American boasts\nBut race hate is not an opinion, its a phobia\nIt isnt a viewpoint, race hate is a disease\nIn a peoples world, the incurable racist has no rights\nHe must be deprived of influence in a peoples government\nHe must be segregated, as he himself would segregate the colored and semitic peoples\nAnything very big is very simple\nIf theres a big race question, theres a big answer to it\nAnd a big answer is simple, like the word no\nAmerica can write her name across this century, and so she will\nIf we, the people, brown and black and red\nRise now to the great occasion of our brotherhood\nIt will take courage\nIt calls for the doing of great deeds, which means the dreaming of great dreams\nGiving the world back to its inhabitants is too big a job for the merely practical\nNo one of us will live to see a blameless peace\nWe strive and pray and die for what will be here when were gone\nOur childrens children are the ancestors of a free people\nTo the generations: the fight is worth it\nAnd that just about means that my time is up\nWhen my times up, I remain as always, obediently yours\nArjun Ivatury21Embed", "24 Freestyle Lyrics\nFeeling this villainous vibe\nFeeling, feeling this villainous vibe\nUh\nChip on my shoulder, fuck is you sayin ?\nSwear to

certain, nothings burning anymore\n Days of Summer]\nI love her smile, I love her hair, I love her teeth. I love this heart-shaped birthmark she has on her neck. I love the way she sometimes, licks her lips before she talks. I love the sound of her laugh.\nI can feel it now, its coming soon\nIt is my world, my sun and moon\nOnce upon a time, this world was love\nBut now I know this is everything that Ive dreamed of\nSo take it slow, speed it up\nEvery time I see you I just want to beat it up\nMaybe not, but thats a lie\nCmon baby girl, there aint no need to cry\nJust let me go or let me know\nWhy the hell you wanna stick around fo\nArms length, thats all you do\nDont get too close, that is the rule\nI remember when I met her back in high school\nScience class, sitting on the stool\nNow Im feeling—feeling like a fool\nCause I cut that tie months ago, this girl is cruel\nOr maybe not, just very lovely\nNo matter what she says I know she still loves me\nSo can I love?—Ive already asked\nWho wouldve known matters of the heart\nWould be such a task?\n Days of Summer]\nI hate summer, I hate her crooked teeth. I hate her 1960s haircut. I hate her knobby knees. I hate her cockroach-shaped splotch on her neck. I hate the way she smacks her lips before she talks. And I hate the way she sounds when she laughs.\nShe used to be my girl\nBut now she just a girl Im fucking\nShe used to mean the world to me\nBut now that world is nothing\nI wouldve put a ring on that finger but I couldnt afford it\nSo I laced it with ribbon, she adored it\nSometimes I wonder if she thinks of me\nBut my mind tells me to focus on work so instinctively\nHow could the pussy be that good?\nCause my feelings involved\nTil my shorty evolved and her feelings dissolved\nBut thats what happens when you find them young\nTreat them like royalty, and they will run\nSearching the world for perfect love and realize youre the one\nBut they fucked up cause now that shit is done\nThis is a letter to the woman of my dreams\nLove what she brings\nSo listen baby girl cause everything aint what it seems\nYou either know me now or Imma meet you after fame\nBut one things for sure, your life will never be the same\nCause youre gonna be my wife and my mistress\nSo understand now I cant be there for every Christmas\nI love you more than anything, but I could never risk this\nOn stage living life, while youre forced to miss this14Embed", "Just Another Day Lyrics\nYeah\nWill I make it?

It don’t matter, cause you with my ex\nThe name of my ex inked on you, to me homie\nExtinct, like a dinosaur, you can probably find me spooning\nWith a dime looking like Lucy Liu, or something to my

like a bottom bunk\nWhy these thirsty bitches throw me pussy like I got them drunk\nI master the flow these up and comers have only spilt\nI got back from Ireland so you know the show I kilt\nI never truly admire the empire I built\nCause when youre comfortable power shifts and positions tilt\nAt business meetings I go through lyrics within my mind\nCause the ultimate therapy is whenever I rhyme\nFirst time shaking their hand for the fifth time\nBeing introduced to people that used to pay me no mind\nUsed to count my money now I weigh it by the crate\nFar from an up-and-comer, my

lingers\nElevated by my kiss as you melted between my fingers\nBabygirl, sometimes I wish\nThat I could just rewind this shit and take it back\nI had visions but they just faded black\nMy train of thought is on a different track\nWhen you’re in love it’s hard to separate fiction from fact\nYour image in my head, and I’m trynna get rid of that\nBut you’re always on my mind like a fitted hat\nBaby girl, I wanna bring it back to puppy love\nWhen you was sent from up above to care for me\nSaid that you’d always be there for me\nAnd even though you’re gone, it’s like you never left\nCuz you always in my heart and still take away my breath\nCan I love?\nBabygirl, can I love?\nI said mama can I love?\nYeah, can I love?\nI wanna laugh with you\nRun the water and take a bath with

lawsuit\n‘Cause I keep hitting them hard with these lines and they all through\nConnor\nIs it real?\nIs it fake?\nI woke up, suddenly I just woke up\nYeah!\nYeah\nAnother day another dollar from that 9 to 5\nYeah, you living but ask yourself, are you really alive?\nI worked outside, I worked with food, I worked behind the desk\nI’ve even hustled around my block, but hold up, I digress\nI’ve paid my dues, see this life I didn’t choose\nMy face on the ten oclock news, shit I refuse\nI was born in a lower class, where gangsters with dough amass\nAnd police would ask questions, but we never answered when asked \nMomma bitching while my sister baby daddy cooking crack in the kitchen\nGetting rich in the street from slanging prescription\nHe showed me how to cook it, he showed me how to cut it\nBut deep down I always knew that life just wouldn’t cut it\nSo I started writing, it was a dark time\nOnly fifteen, but the shit I seen would blow your mind\nSchool was getting harder due to my life at home\nPrincipal always calling ‘cause I had barely shown\nNo father figure, my mother tried her best to be both\nBut let’s be honest a father really helps with your growth\nBut I was raised by Nas and Jay Z and Big L and Eminem\nAll of them set examples through they lyrics\nListen close so I could hear it, about life and how not to fear it\nHow to grab the wheel and steer it, and so I...\nAnd so I did just that\nWord of advice follow your dreams and never look back\nI said it’s Logic\nIs it real?\nIs it fake?\nI woke up, suddenly I just woke up\nYeah!34Embed", "Love Jones

maybe even start the whole shit off with this is... Im not sorry for making this album, and I made this album from a place in my heart of love... and Im black and Im proud as shit. Thats the shit, thats the thing the whole world said I could never say or be or do. And Im biracial and I love my fans. Swag. Flex. Rattpack\nCmon! Is it going? Alright, whats up guys, This is day one of recording for the, I mean Claps Hey, Whats up guys. Make sure you keep that last part in there of me explaining it because were real all the time. RattPack\nMy studio is being built\nLogic: Tapping on glass\nBobby Campbell: Tapping his foot What are you going to contribute?\n6ix: Claps\nThat was the first song ever created in this room\nYeah, Thats the first beat ever, damn\n: But like, whats it like from, going to whats going to be in here from Charles Hall?\nOh, Nuts. Its gon- Its the come up. Its the glow up. Its what weve always wanted\nUh, Well the message for the music is just equality of man. Straight up. Straight up and down. 6 oclock. When white people find out that Im black, racist white people. They treat me on some like-and Ive heard this, Send your ass back to Africa, or at least the half that doesnt matter. Shit like that, that Ive heard. Its like thats what I am, Im either one or the other to these people. Theres like just a handful, no more than I think like 4 songs, where I am truly discussing being biracial in America. With that being said, Those are the only times I discuss race, and its my race. Not your race or his race or her race, Its just me being biracial and telling my story. And you might not like my story, but its my story\nYou know, and then the entire rest of the album is rapped, you know, from different perspectives of a life that that dude Atom, who is being reincarnated has lived\nTheres a guy who dies in the beginning of this album and his name is Atom. Atom but like the first man right? But spelled A-T-O-M, like the atoms in our body and everything connecting us. He gets hit by a car and wakes up in a white void. And hes talking to this random guy. And the guys like Life, Whats it all about? And hes like What? What the fuck you talkin about? Hes like Where am I? Well, it turns out the random guy is actually God. Have you ever heard of this guy named Neil DeGrasse Tyson? Scientist, scientist, astrophysicist, crazy, super awesome, and I dont know how the hell I did it, but I got him to play the role of God on my album. Which is crazy\nI cant even believe that Neil DeGrasse Tyson is on this album. Like when I think about it, thats like the most gangster feature of all time\nLogic: So what now, what advice can you give me?\nNeil: What advice can I give humanity?\nYou guys know Big Von? Hes like the radio DJ from the bay, on KMEL\nOh Yeah\nSo he plays this guy named Atom\nBig Von: Wait, wait, wait, what? Stop all the hippie shit\nThis guy Atom dies and its a whole conversation between them. And he finds out that he is about to be reincarnated. And then he finds out that not only that is he being reincarnated, but that he is everybody who has ever been reincarnated because there is only one human being. And he has been reincarnated so many times, in fact, that he is every human being that has ever existed. You know he was Jesus and all of his disciples. He was Hitler and everybody that he murdered. You know, every time he extended a hand of kindness to someone, he was doing it to himself. Every time he was extending a hand of hatred or murder to someone, he was only doing it onto himself. And it isnt until he has lived in the shoes of ever man, woman, child, race, religion, color, creed, and sexual orientation that he will know what it is to appreciate life and then be taken to the next plane of existence. So every time Im rapping on the album pretty much, Im rapping from the perspectives of one of the lives he has lived. So its very sci-fi, but its very real at the same time. Its weird man, its a good one\nHip-Hop artists are tasked to not have any imagination, but to actually work in direct correlation to where they are from, who they were, and you know he has a lot of imagination\nI was actually really inspired when I read a short story that was written by a writer by the name of Andy Weir called The Egg. I read it and it inspired me so much, and its essentially the same thing, its just my take on it. You know, its a man who dies and is reincarnated and lives every life ever. And I thought wow, I relate to more than just one sect or one side of humanity or race being biracial. I kind of feel that. I feel kind of what what its like to be two people. To be like a black man in a fair skinned body, if that makes any sense. So its like wow, its almost like living two separate lives to the public. Not to me, but to others. They might view me as different people. I guess wow, thats crazy I never really thought of it like that\nSo bringing who he is into the stories that he wants to tell and having them intertwine with reality and fantasy, sci-fi, Thats the difficult thing to score\nI didnt think I was going to be able to pull it off. I mean how do you pull off that? How do you pull off an album rapping from different perspectives of a life that one man lived, who is actually everyone ever. its just crazy, but I dont know how the hell it came together, but it did\nThis is so much more than just music. Its like a true personal part of my life. So, Im getting my license, Im doing my best to get fit and in shape, and deal with being mentally healthy and physically healthy. And dealing with my music and friends, wife, personal relationship, and dogs and everything. So I just want you guys to see as much of my life as you can see\nSo yesterday, I think i was telling Mike that I had the wildest anxiety ever. In my mind I was like, Im like Im fine, Im fine I dont know why but I was feeling physically weird. Not like ill or anything, just like- faint. You know kind of dizzy, kind of out of it. Very disconnected\nFan: Logic?\nLogic: Sup dude?\nFan: Whats going on man, hows you day?\nLogic: Nice, I got an appointment. Whats your name man?\nFan: Raymond\nLogic: Shakes his hand Nice to meet you Raymond\nRaymond: You have a great day\nLogic: Thanks brother\nYeah, thats a big thing that Ive been dealing with so much, which is like anxiety. A lot of people dont understand it and thats why Im like having you document this right now because I want to invite everybody into my life like never before and I have severe anxiety and its hard and it sucks\nIts just so crazy because Ive always-like Im on my shit you know what I mean? Like Im on my shit and I know what I need to do and how I need to do things But then anxiety can step in and be like you feel up to having this meeting or this conversation or going on stage or performing or this or that, But Im gonna fuck you up. Like its weird, its crazy and so anxiety is so much more than just mental. its a mental thing that can affect you physically and thats why when I had the biggest panic attack I ever had last year, you know just after The Incredible True Story was made, I was convinced I was going through was a physical thing. I was convinced it was something deeper like it was fucking cancer. Like, you know what I mean? Cause my body was so fucked up and um, its not that. Its my mind. Its anxiety\nWhen I went in the booth and I knew all of you guys were all out there listening, and I was learning it there and then on the spot, what he wanted me to sing. Damn, my legs were shaking, I was so nervous, It was the first time I sung it and I guess that’s when you really-like I realized that hes got a vision and I have to trust it because I wanted to practice it and get better at it, he comes back in and I was like I wanna know, I want to capture how you are right now when youre singing this for the first time\nI think thats good, ah!\nThe first time in my life I have done anything like that\nYou never?\nIm not really sure how it goes\nNow listening back i really understand why he wanted to do that cause there was a vulnerability to what was captured that i dont know if that would have been the same if I had learnt it\nYo, making music makes me feel good man. Like when Im here with you guys, like not to sound any type of way, a lot of that,I mean I still be feelin weird, but a lot of it goes away. Its like I have purpose with you guys\nHold on, Im trying to think... one sec. Should it end with the hook? Or maybe-maybe thats not the hook. Maybe I keep going right now and then I bring the hook again... thats what Ill do, I will extend this verse...\nIts always really hard to recreate a vibe, because I was in such a zone the other night. I have to tap back into that same energy. Its gotta be the same\nAlright, NO NO. Can you pause it? I fucking hate technology. Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it... alright can you run it back with the last shit i was doing? My fucking- my phone deleted all the shit. Fucking hate this shit\nI think this is harder than when I did Gang Related.\nLet me hear that... Woo!\nSo I need you to bring it back so it sounds really good, you know? You gotta make it like, you gotta make my vocals pop, period. Like Im going here and this breaks, like you gotta feel it in your soul. As the Engineer you need to know what youre doing. You know what Im saying? Gotta be really good\nI lost my job to Bart Simpson?\nYeah, youre fucking out bro\nI was with No I.D. yesterday, Hadent seen him for a while. And we just had a real good talk. Man to man, shot some pool\nWe shoot pool, and I just want it know I won 3 games today. it doesnt matter... WHEN YOU EDIT THIS JUST KNOW... 3-0\nJust out of nowhere, then I played him my album. And he loved it\nMy thoughts were just by far his best work, for me\nAnd I asked him to rap on it, and he said yeah\nI mean, I can- I can rap\nNo I.D. is going to rap on my album. Which is like, what, thats so unheard of\nI havent really recorded a song in 20 years\nI texted J. Cole and I was like, Yo, Deons rapping on my album, No I.D., and he was like WHAT? How the fuck did you get him to do that? and I thought about it, and I just asked him. Only you could get him to do that\nIve waited for this moment my whole life. Right now, nothing else matters. Just making music here with Deon\nThe concept is how were all and whats going on in the Native American community thats being ignored\nAmerica, so America came together, you all were there. That shit was crazy. I just found these like sample packs or like little things and like vocals and I was pressing them, and I was throwing drums on, and creating the pads\nWhen I create music I hear sounds. Distinct-- Thats why you can hear my shit when you got to festivals or whatever. They sing all the words because its catchy. All the sounds are catchy. First things you hear, Woo... thats the ohhhh  and it goes off\nYoull hear a switch up and then Im just rapping from like a hood motherfucker and thats all he knows. And like, thats a lot of my own experience like with my brothers, and then my boy Lenny is like helping me voice this, youll hear it\nWhen Logic approached me with the contributing to the song America he laid it out. He knew what he wanted so he gave me the inspiration. Told me exactly what he was going for in that part of the song\nWe worked on the first album, and I was the Executive Producer. And some of the first session into the album I pretty much knew he was a producer, not just a rapper. I told him hey, you dont really need me to produce your records, because you have your ideas. You need to you know have access to the personnel and techniques to deliver your thoughts.\nThe first album was 6ix and Logic, the exact same way they did it on the mixtapes. Like nothing has changed from that you know. These two guys, sitting in the house, not the big studio, not even down here, not anywhere special. Just the two of them sitting down with the laptop, a concept, and some kind of inspiration\nWhats crazy too is you know, the same process we were doing back in the day. Like , we didnt have the string players, we didnt have the vocalists with us. Thats whats so crazy about it is, the process is the same, but now we get to involve actual real musicians, rather than me tryna sample a string part from another song because I cant play it. But now I can be like, we have Claire and Tom to actually play the shit\nBig Von, he just gets really entertaining\nGot Neil on the album, you know how crazy that is? Space, Time, all the good things like that. Man, Logic has come up with the crazy story of all stories\nSo I was in Paris, with my wife, at the Louvre\nSo, it all started last summer when I get a call from Bob. And I pick up the phone, and Its three in the morning, and I say Bob, whats up man, what the fuck is this? And hes like Im in Paris man, Im at the Louvre, and I know what our album is going to be.\nEverybody is looking at the Mona Lisa, and Im looking at the Mona Lisa like Wow, Leonardo Da Vinci painted this shit. Woah, this is crazy.\nBut then Im looking at, myself included, everyone is so focused on the Mona Lisa, Im in this insane museum with all this beautiful statues and paintings and all different types of stuff. So I was like Im gonna go look for something else, not just focus on this. And I turn around, and as soon as I turn around I see this\nThis is The Wedding at Cana. It was when Jesus turned water into wine\nIm like Dude, doesnt that have like a hundred people in it? and hes like Yeah, it has like over 100 people. I dont know if we need that many, but like close. I want you to paint all of it. I want all my friends, all my family, everyone who works on this albums, people of all races, colors, creeds, sexual orientations, and genders. I wasnt it to be representative of Everybody.\nEarly into the year I decided I wanted to go to Italy to get inspiration for this. I did my research online, went through Google image search, and I studied countless books about the artist himself, other artists in the period, but theres limits to that. there was something about it where I felt compelled-- I always wanted to go to Italy. if there was ever a chance, why not now?\nI went to every possible church I could, I went to the museum, I saw the Caravaggio, I immersed myself in everything Ive loved and researched and I brought it back and put everything into the cover\nThis is going to be my album cover\nThe album is told from a variety of perspectives, which is something Bob loves to do. Putting himself in someone elses shoes and taking on their struggles and success, trying to see things through their perspective. This album, listening to it, sonically connects you to the art. it just executes that flawlessly\n For the longest time, I just wanted to focus on the music and not talk about race or negative shit going on in the world because I wanted it to be happy and fun, and about lyricism and raw shit. I felt that i needed to make and album like this because me being black & white and feeling discriminated against by my own people, made me feel like I need to talk about everyone else who was discriminated against\nI didnt wanna be like Im biracial, but I look white and blah blah blah, no Im really gonna talk about not only whats on my heart and mind, but whats on the hearts and minds of people all over the world who dont have the voice that I do\nI am here with Patrick Starr in my studio. And I recruited him because hes amazing and awesome and hes a very sweet, kind person, and an amazing business man-- Or business queen. No, but honestly, hes just been so awesome and hes just such a great role model for so many people I wanted to include him as a representative for his culture and just have him on the album and album cover\nThank you! This is dope, so dope\nI appreciate it, Thank you\nI see good people who like to make good music and its just that simple. Like Hey, do you like what Im doing? Do you like what I stand for? Oh you like this message? you wanna come play? You wanna be a part of it? Yes or No?\nSo Im flying this woman out, from the Bahamas, where me and my wife went on our anniversary. Her name is Paula\nHiii, Im Paula McKeva, all the was from , Bahamas. Met Bobby, known as Logic as well, in the Atlantis resort and Casino Hotel\nWe were at the bar having a few drinks and this shit was killing it\nI was singing Uptown Funk, so everyone was on the floor having fun\nI was like up, and I was dancing with like all these older ladies and shit. It was like so fun\nBut like she KILLED it. Her voice was like killing it. She was doing like Whitney Houston songs and shit\nI told him to come on the stage and said Show me what you got. Then he went WILD and crazy. I didnt know who he was\nAfter dinner, and she went to take a little break, I asked her if she wanted to come sing on my album, and she said yeah.\nKev, I love what youre doing, but were gonna mute that sound\n\nI just had this crazy cry because Im happy though. And Im not trying to milk anything, but I thought I should let you know. I just wanted to in this moment-- Let you know I was listening to this song, Anziety and just thinking about how hard it is to live with it. But beyond that, the song, it made me realize how many people are here. How many people are in this house. And how blessed I am to have my wife and my dogs and my friends and music and fans. I cant believe it. Because I didnt have anything growing up, I didnt have anything. And now I have everything I could have ever wanted. And just right now in this moment I am so happy and blessed. Sorry, I just wanted to real quick-- Im not trying to milk it or anything. I just wanted to say that, that i cant believe its all real and happening\n Were at Warner Bros. We are at the soundstage where they do all the scoring for films, and we are doing the album. And Im excited, I feel like I dont belong here\nI just wanted to say this is fucking crazy. Like, Im sorry, this is just crazy and I know were here to work but like I came from nothing-- so to be able to be here today is a very emotional thing. And this album is about the equality of man regardless of race, religion, color, creed and sexual orientation. This is the fight for equality\nYo, Bob, you know whats really crazy? Making a beat on Ableton of FL Studio and then like seeing that shit charted out and noted. Thats amazing, isnt that like crazy\nYeah, were just like Neanderthals\nLike all the sheet music, but like what we sample\nMy name is Bobby Smokey Hall, Im legend. Im the legend of hip-hop go-go. Im here to see my son, Logic, one of the hypest artists out there. Hes just in his own zone. Hes got a string session going on right now. so yeah, I love him\nIts been an amazing experience, and I really appreciate it \nBobby has always been driven, even as a kid. He was a leader, not a follower. He never followed, you know what Im saying? he had his own way that he lived\nI took Bobby in the recording studio when he was like 15 for the first time. And he spit for like 45 minutes, non-stop. The engineer and I, Rock, just laughed and said That boy got bars.\nYou were talking to your mates last night on the sofa and I was just like listening in and trying to learn what you guys were talking about. And you were saying like We work with loads of people, but we FUCK with Logic. And I was like... excuse me? You were like You know what Im saying, we FUCK with Logic. We FUCK with him you know what Im saying? And Im like what are you talking about? I had no idea what that meant\nSo when did that click for you what that meant?\nOh, only like 24 hours later, when I asked what it was. Did I ask one of you guys? I was like What does that mean when you fuck with someone? I thought if youre fucking with someone, youre fucking them up or something\nThis is a classic documentary moment right here\nLucy, I got a better one for you. You ever heard of what a fuckboy is?\nSo yeah, that, Jess said, before she met you, I went out with a couple of fuckboys and I was like is that just some one like, you have sex with?\nShe said that just means like a lame person\nWell, I fuck with Logic\nYeah, we fuck with you Lucy Rose\nI fuck with you all\nWe fuck with you\nIt was a long-ass time ago, Im in the studio with this mo-fucker and he brings this in\nAnd Im like Dillon whats that? And hes like its that P1 bro, for sure. And Im like damn thats crazy, thats so cool, hes like yeah man check it out, doing all this shit and Im like oh my god, I gotta have this\nSo i hopped in the whip, I go, I drop the bread on this shit immediately, and all I get out of it , like used it for. I spent all that money, and got the kick for Like Woah, and its worth every penny\nThis is rapped from the perspective of a rapper that like, the first half, it almost sounds like a sample with the vocals, but its all myself. And hes saying like  I dont want to sleep all day and get up at night like ehs not happy with the life that hes living because hes one of those rappers focussing on money and material possessions\nIts called Ink Blot because one of the line is Im not me, Im who you want me to be. And hes rapping like yeah I got this money and Im not a real rapper its all bullshit, Im making my money, fuck it.\nLike that personification of that rapper like that tone, chain wearing, yeah yeah I rap, but deep down hes not happy, but his raps are like yeah I got this and millions. its just a rapper who isnt happy with himself, but is making a lot of money. So thats the song\nPerpetratin ass, dumb ass mothafuckas, man\nAll on the Gram, all on the Snapchat with the bullshit\nKill yo mothafuckin self, nigga\nKill yo mothafuckin self, nigga\nAnd tell yo bitch I said slob on my knob\nThat’s crazy!\nYo, I’ma keep all this shit for the album\nOh they gon love that, they gon be like, Aw fuck\nSo, were here, on Scotch Wednesday, its a little thing I do with my buddies. Every Wednesday, as grown men, we drink scotch, shoot pool, play some jazz and Sinatra on vinyl over there. \nDid you smoke a Jefferey?\nFreefalllll\nWoah wait, who has some other really good ones you can impersonate? Like Sinatra... OH give me Tonight Show All hand on deck, go\nKeep going\nYoure gonna do great. ... you just totally left me hanging\nOh, sorry\nHello, sir, how are you doing today?\nIm doing good, how are you doing?\nYou brought the whole--\nYeah, we brought the whole team\nOh, excuse me, who is taking the picture?\nIm upset that I did what Im supposed to do. Thats the thing Im telling you man. Its not like a fail. Ive failed before, many times. Its just that when you know you did everything, you know you did it\nWere at the DMV. Bobs taking his driving test for the second shot. And uh, Im a little bit nervous. I know he can drive, but just these instructors take of points for the craziest things\nThank you, 29, I can go in through here. Swag\nGot that license though\nBlack Spiderman I wrote, first and foremost, its about stereotypes, and that people make me believe I should be ashamed of who I am, and Im not\nLike, be you, fuck EVERYBODY else, just be you. And people are goig to hate on you, they hate on me and my message is Peace, Love and Positivity, and people HATE me. Like think about that... Thats CRAZY! When you look at people you see things. You see a black man, you see a middle eastern man, you see,... there are people that are conditioned to look at people of color or people that are brown on an airplane a little weird. and thats so FUCKED up and I hate that. People look at me and I go, Im a rapper, and they go What? or people are conditioned to not accept me in hip-hop because of how i look, or how i speak. Oh, you speak white or you talk white, like the fuck? Ive heard that my whole life Im saying in general for this career. What do you mean talk white? What the fuck does that mean?\nI said fuck that, why cant Spiderman be black? Why cant James Bon be gay? Why not? like fuck it! And thats why I open it up with Black Jesus, Black Jesus. And people are like What? Black Jesus? What the fuck? Like Ive got a Black Santa Clause right now in my house\nIve known Damien for 6-7 years now, maybe even 8 years. And weve just been buddies like through the internet. And we used to do records together. I wasnt shit, I wasnt nobody. I knew I wanted him to be on the album, and he dropped EVERYTHING to come out here. With no promise of placement or anything like that, just to see where he could contribute. And Im sitting down there, and were working, and Im like I think I need some vocals on here. And, like I said, i trust everybody, who knows whats going to happen? You want to go in there, and lets see what you got. He told me before Bobby hit record, that you could hear it in the microphone, his heart pumping\nAnd like, I could just feel the magnitude of this moment. And how pivotal it was\nHe was like this is 6 years in the making that just came out. And...\nI dont know, something just hit me and I started letting loose\nSomething about that, some type of grabbed me and let me soar vocally\nYES! Praise him! Im putting this on the album! GET IN HERE RIGHT NOW . COME HERE!\nYou just earned yourself a feature credit\nIt was like one of those milestones in your career where you know youre just in the right room, and the right mind state. Everything just lined up\nI only work with people that are as good and creative as I am in their field. I like when people make me feel fucking stupid. I like when people are so good at playing strings, or piano, or singing, or whatever that makes me feel talentless. I cant do what they do. Like Im Batman. Im Player 1, Im Super Mario, so are you guys behind the camera, so is 6ix. I dont work with Player 2s, I dont work with Robins. I work with other Batmen, and I know that sounds really weird, but what i mean by that is you, whenever you leave, and you take this camera to do whatever you do, you are a boss. Youre a boss, and you go do boss shit. But when youre with me, youre under my wing, being a boss, helping me paint my boss-ass picture\nWith Logic, time to go to the basement. Its my time to shine. Hopefully I have something that actually like fit on the project\nWhen i first met I could see this \nI mean, hes a superior lyricist. We already know that. He puts together classic albums, we know that. This is beautiful, its rich, its moody, it revs you up and brings you down. Its an ALBUM, and in an age where that may not be important, its refreshing. You know? so, bravo! Ive told him before, I think hes one of the best in the world\nMannnn, come on. Thanks man\nLogics music makes me feel something. I dont listen to a whole lot of hip-hop or rap music. And when I first met Bobby he did ask me  Why do you listen to my music? Like I dont understand. Like you play this sweet folk music and then you listen to my music. but theres something about it I just cant explain, but it makes me really feel something\nIts kind of scary. I cant explain. like when I first started making music I was willing to sacrifice everything because I had nothing to lose. But now, i have everything to lose. That isnt a bad thing. That just means I have a good life\nIt makes me work harder. Because I was working so hard to obtain all of this. But now I have to work even harder to keep it\nOoooo I just gave you some fire!\nWith my last album I went around to radio stations, and I shook hands, and I jerked people off. And I was like Yeah whats up! trying to get radio placements. But not like trying to work for the radio, but like trying to get more people to hear. And this time, Im like fuck that shit. Im not going nowhere, im not doing any press. This album has already done what it was intended to do, and it was to set me free of any shame the public made me feel. It did what it was intended to do because I dont give a shit what anybody else thinks\nAnd Im really not gonna try to get too much into it, but I had a conversation with J. Cole about the public, and being on social media, and all these things. Like I dont need the public to accept me. I dont need anybody to tell me my music is great, or Im amazing. Because I know Im good, I know Im great, and I know Im amazing. Just like you, and them, so fuck anybody else and what they got to say because I know Im good, and thats what this album is about. Knowing that youre beautiful, youre great, and youre special. Knowing that you are something, were something, and will be something\nSo fuck everybody else\n3Embed", "Babel Lyrics\nOkay, so what do you think life was like before the fall? I mean weve seen pictures of open land as far as the eye can see and oceans incomprehensible in size that our grandparents would do their best to describe it. I just cant imagine life anywhere but inside a space station. I mean the simple concept of a sky doesnt even fully register...\nWe do have fields on the Babel station and also—\nYeah, yeah—but thats all synthetic. I mean were heading to this planet right? That we call Paradise, because we hope it can sustain life. Why?\nBecause well eventually run out of resources...\nExactly! I mean what if we got there and its exactly as the data predicted: beautiful, lush—then we destroy it just like we did Earth? Theres only 5 million human beings left in the universe. I mean, its weird to think about the fact that in 2065 the last footprint was left on Earth before ascending to Babel.\nMan, whats your point?\nThe point is, 30 ships have traveled in deep space looking for a planet like this. Damn near all of them return home without any luck! Some of them didnt return at all.I guess my fear isnt that we wont find Paradise: its that well create purgatory...2Embed", "Finding Forever Freestyle Lyrics\nGo go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three\nGo go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three\nGo go, go, go, go, go, go\nOn the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy, now\nGo go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three\nGo go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three\nGo go, go, go, go, go, go\nOn the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy, now\nFeel like Ive been waiting fo ever, for ever ever?\nThrough any endeavour, whatever my hand on the lever ready to go\nReady to go, yeah ready to go, uh, ready to go, ready to\nThis the shit they never know\nIve been dealing with suits and fans talking about Im straying from my raw roots\nWell what if I told you some the music you hearing is actually from years ago\nIm talking long ago\nBut its funny how the public aint perceiving a little\nRumors started and everyone wanna believe that Id just leave it and go\nLeave it and go, leave it and go, leave it and go\nBitch Ive been a beast, Im eating like 10-a-piece\nHomie put your mind to ease, keep enemies on a leash\nShout out to the homie Common, I know Im redoing your shit\nBut you was fucking with the album so Im sure it aint a problem\nA bit under pressure, nothing can measure\nBut all these beautiful women around mes such a pleasure\nShout out to the RattPack\nYall its looking like September, I know it feel like forever but we all gon get that together just\nGo, go, go, go\nIm writing this record on the back of the tour bus\nSeem like every year that pass man theres been more of us\nMe, Lenny, C Dot and 6ix thought it was the four of us\nAnd the homie QuESt, and the homie Jon Bellion\nThats my morte fame, you know we gotta goin on\nOn the roll with the fever yeah Im still on the mic\nDid a show, sick as hell, but Im still alright\nYou know we on that Wu-Tang, resurrect it with the band\nScreaming money aint a thang, Visionary be the gang\nWhen Im done with the verse just send it to Bobby so the mix great\nAnd when it drops, get the Castro mixtape \nGoddamn, you know I feel it\nAll the fans want the album, but you know Ive gotta kill it first\nHella come up with a muthafucking killer verse\nRest in peace, man I wish I had a Dilla verse\nGo, go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three\nGo, go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three\nGo, go, go, go, go, go and on the count of three\nGo, go, go, go, go, go, go\nOn the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy, now\nPeople say the same stuff about rap music\nPeople are just like, “Oh rap music now, oh it sucks.

really paid it no mind\nAnd when he was of age the situation was shitty\nSo he packed up all his stuff and then he moved across the city\nRented a room from his homies mom and dad\nThey saw the situation and they felt so bad\nThey let him live with em, and he was doing good\nWorking at the street fixing cars under their hood\nHe got up with his mentor, that he knew for a while\nHe met him back when he was a youngin, only a child\nA real good guy that gave him some equipment\nAnd then he sent him packing like a UPS shipment\nHe said lay some tracks, and maybe we can get it\nSo then he quit his job and he moved in with his sister\nThey lived together as children so yes he really missed her\nBut then he got another job, still working on music\nTryna find a style and figure out how to use it\nBut one day he got it, yes, hes so excited\nBut then he stopped\nSaid I got a way to go on top, they gon find me\nSuch a long journey like Im walking I-90\nThree thousand miles leaving the

No its just, its just open season, ocean miles, you know\nUh, we used to rap together back in high school\nBattle for respect, I hadnt seen you since I dropped out\nYears later reconnected\nThis citys the worst, Im tryna do more than what has been expected\nIts what you told me\nWhy they had to take your life away?\nWhat makes me shiver is we called you trigger\nFeels like your fate was early delivered\nMy condolences were sent with love\nI pray you found the peace you needed from these gates above\nMeanwhile its getting worse, my cousin just got murked\nOver some girl who set him up\nMy mother cried til her pupils were running dry\nIts do or die\nI feel the pressure setting in\nNever thought desperation would ever be this prevalent\nI hope you know we miss you\nI put you in these verses\nCarry on your name and hope your dream can live through mine since our visions one and the same\nSteady working since the slaying\nI was plotting a couple things\nBut sometimes, this life will force you to change\nYoshi Im glad you survived\nWhen Juan told me you got shot up, I was devastated\nJust had a conversation bout you leaving selling dope, and sticking to a 9-5 man\nYou wanted more for your daughter man\nLooking in your eyes I know you meant it\nAll you ever saw was a way to provide\nIm just glad youre alive\nConscious agreed that even though youre paralyzed, I kept you in my prayers\nFurther convinced me, shit is shifty\nBetter leave while I can man\nI swear man its no love in the city\nAnd this is all I know\nNo love\nAnd this is all I know\nNo love\nAnd this is all I know\nNo love\nAnd this is all I know\nNo love\nNo, no, when everything is not alright\nAnd even when Im positive its hard to see the light\nI pray my spirit brightens up before my soul takes flight\nIve been searching for myself, please God dont let me lose this fight\nTonight, tonight, tonight\nPeople say, you have to have a lot of passion for what youre doing. And its totally true, and the reason is because its so hard, that if you dont any rational person would give up. Its really hard, and you have to do it over a sustained period of time.

First and foremost because the original Growing Pains I & II were on mixtapes and before this album, I did, uh, the mixtape Welcome To Forever and there was no Growing Pains, uh, from any part of the series on that. So I think a lot of people thought that it may have been over and there wasnt going to be another one, and i wanted to give them that feeling of wow! like wow. Growing Pains III and all these people who heard these things on the mixtape like Man, hes still there. Hes still Logic, like Wow. Im a fan, I know what its like, and you kind of dread like Ohh, whats that album gonna sound like? For me, I wanted to give them this\nIt opens up with a skit, and I love Wu-Tang Clan, so I always loved their skits, so its basically about the first time I ever heard gunshots outside of my window as a little boy. And then it opens up, Outside I can hear em bussin, bussin, and the police they rushin, go to my head like concussion And Im about fifteen years old at that time, and the gunshots, I still hear them every now and then throughout my life and Im wondering, I always used to wonder What caused that shootout? Why did I hear his? What was it? So I kind of created the fictitious tale of something that was, in fact, a true event. So that goes in, when you first hear me rapping Im laying in bed at fifteen years old and all the things racing through my mind, from the eviction notice on my door, you know, just being on food stamps and welfare and not knowing whats going to happen tomorrow and just, all the wonders. And then the beat changes up and I actually fall asleep. So this is my inner-most subconscious thoughts that I didnt even realize at the time, at fifteen years old, but now, you know, at twenty-four and looking back, reminiscing, I know that those are the things that are on my mind, because growing up in that situation, no matter what, um, the only time I was special, the only time I was anybody was when I was asleep. When I was asleep I was a famous basketball player, baseball player, I was a rapper/artist, I was a singer, I was an actor, I was dancer, I was an astronaut, but when I woke up I was just a boy from a broken home, and that- that was very hard to swallow\nEven touching upon the lines about the television and feeling like that family, you know growing up on The Cosbys and Family Matters, and you know, that was the closest thing I had to a real family. Once the television program turned off, or our electricity turned off, I snapped back to reality. Um, I didnt end it on a bright note, because theres people out there that feel that same way, so I wanted them to know that Im with them. And Im there, and I was there, and I understand, so...1Embed", "Never LyricsLyrics From Snippet\nAye, pull up in a Whip\nFeeling good\nFinally at the hood\nFinally getting money like a real one

Uh, Kebu from Atlanta originally did the first rendition of this song, um, with the sample that we later replayed, um, thats when I brought in DJ Khalil... and it was kind of just the fun, braggadocios-ness of hip-hop, yet really beginning to tell my story as well - Just in the flow, the cadence, kinda just showing off skill, um, but still telling that story and painting the picture of where the album conceptually was headed\nThen, on the second half, uh, thats where, you know you really get into, uh, just the mental state of a hungry emcee, you know, releasing his first album.

many shorts in my life to contemplate\nScores need to settle so the pressure can escape\nStrange place to be in but its strange to be at all\nIf you wanna take the call gotta learn to take the

And then the next day, you know, he made this beat and um, and I wrote to it and for me this is my inspiration. Me talking about my old inspiration. Of maybe just money and women and cars, the cliche hip-hop thing that I think a lot of people kind of get into hip hop for, just fun stuff, but- um, kind of getting rid of that and going Im going to tell my story, finding the inspiration of wanting to just be myself, and let the world know who I am and just make.... music.

Spoiler alert here, if you- if you don’t understand the concept of Nikki, or you havent heard the song yet, please do listen to that before you continue with this, please. For me, I was always- Im- I’m just a huge fan of music. You know, I wear my heart on my sleeve, my inspirations on my sleeve, and one of them is Kanye West. And I always loved his song Addiction. You know, Whats you addiction? Is it money? Is it cars? Is it ? I got addict- You know, its just like, I wanted to do something as well\nBut like I said, I grew up in a- in a pretty crazy household and I saw, you know, the use of narcotics and alcohol, and how it destroyed my family, so I-I never really went down that, so I-I never really had an addiction except cigarettes... And I thought, Well, thats kinda corny. Like, you know what I mean? Cigarettes is so frowned upon. How can I do it in a way where people can relate to it? And then I-I-I discovered the concept of Nikki, and taking it much more further than just this song: putting her all over the album. And if I talk about Nikki as if she is in fact a woman, then it would- it would- it would allude to that\nAnd um, but its even before then. You know, I mean nine months before the album was even out, I would hashtag Whos Nikki? on Twitter, this or that. Whos Nikki? Whos Nikki? And everybody was wondering, everybody thinks, Is it his mom? Is it an ex-girlfriend? Is it it a this? Is it his sister? Is it-blah And everybody wants to know, everybody wants to know. Then you hear me on the record, on Bounce, In the whip, everyday wit’ Nikki, she be ridin’ wit me. You know? Different things like that, and you’re like, What? Who is this chick? Who is this chick?\nAnd then you get to the song, and I-I-I wrote it, as almost as if it was a break-up song. I love it when youre fresh. I love it when I take your top off and we share the same breath. Like, uhh, matters of making love, or this or that. And when you finally get to the end and its like nicotine, its like that wow moment, you know? I remember watching SAW for the first time and realizing that the killer was in the room the entire time, and I was like, Oh my god! You know what I mean? So, that’s what I wanted to create, and I think I did my best to create a song where its not just nicotine. I could be heroin, it could be alcohol, it could be sex, it could be gambling, it could be whatever your thing is, um... Maybe it isnt even that bad, or maybe its just a man or a woman that youre dealing with. Or... I-I wrote it so surface level that the listener can take it however they want, and then deep down, you would know what the song is aboutEmbed", "Run Lyrics\nSo just come fly son\nAnd dont be shy son\nI see youre hidin\nYoure a man on the run\nAnd if you dont feel like runnin\nI know the sun gone be shinin\nSo stop all the cryin\nOhohoh, Ohohoh, Ohohoh\nBoy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight\nBoy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind\nBoy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight\nBoy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind\nOhoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh\nSo just before your time\nAnd take your time son\nAnd just come fly son\nI see youre tryin but youre just a man on the run\nOhoh oh-oh\nYoure just a man on the run\nOhoh oh-oh\nHol up yes i know it now\nEverybody wanna come around\nFeel like i wanna dumb it down\nFeel like i dont wanna come around\nNow everybody wanna run, run\nNow everybody wanna run around\nI feel like Im runnin runnin\nI feel like Im runnin okay\nMy bobby, this city, this average life i live it\nRespect but I just dont give it\nAnd I really wanna wonder what is it\nI hope that I visit, this paradise what is it\nMy vision is livid and I truly hope that I live it\nYeah\nBoy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight\nBoy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind\nBoy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight\nBoy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind\nOhoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh\nBoy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight\nBoy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind\nBoy you better run, run, run, maybe tonight\nBoy you better run, run, run, run, run, outta my mind\nOhoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-oh, Ohoh oh-ohEmbed", "​eat the rice Lyrics\nFor you...

Like you have a better shot at getting caught shot as a white person by a white cop than a black person does by a white cop, like its just not happening so. Weve come a long way, but weve got a long way to go, people still get away, like I said rapists fall through the cracks, they get weak sentences, that doesnt mean we tolerate rape, we dont live in a rape culture, you want to see a rape culture?

days when I would call girls whores\nBut now I regret it, said I regret it\nNo I dead it\nCause its mind over matter, unless we talking brain matter\nBut the only thing that matters, is my mind gets

a rapper with no talent\nWho has no room for improvement\nIt’s ludicrous how much trash is released but we all consume it so assumin’ it’s not the artists\nI guess it’s now the fans, they the one’s into it\nThey the one’s who viewin’ all this music and givin’ publicity to rappers who ain’t even suited for the game\nAnd overlookin’ all the talent that is rooted from the ground\nI’m comin’ in now,

head out\nI’ma speak from the heart with this final verse\nJust gotta quickly get this shit off my chest\nAnd again man, thank you Bobby Boy for these wonderful beats\n‘Preciate it\nNow let’s get it, yeah\nI sometimes forget how life can be kinda precious\nI guess I never notice from all the days I was reckless\nHip hop is my obsession, I let it get to my head and control my expression\nI guess it’s kinda like an infection\nIt allows me now to write all my confessions\nBack with that Therapy album, I was just sufferin’ from depression\nHad a lot of shit to get off of my chest and I kinda forget the feelin’ that I had up at the time, I was super stressed and\nA couple months later I wrote this personal album\nAnd I dedicated it to someone I thought was down to be by my side for the rest of my life\nBut that didn’t turn out\nBut I still do love her and hope she knows that I always will count her as my number one fan\nThere’s no one else on this earth that can replace what she did\nShe gave me confidence first and that now why I put in work\n‘Cause I know that anything’s possible\nSo just over the summer I released the Bad Guy Chronicles\nAnd it’s sad because I gave you everythin’ that I had\nI think it’s probably one the best albums I wrote, in fact\nI remember writin’ to it\nThinkin’ y’all would love how I rap\nBut literally within a week, it got despised and attacked\nAnd I didn’t know how to handle it, I was sorta confused\nLike I just gave you everythin’ that y’all just wanted me to\nAnd I was mad and I hated it, I didn’t know what to do\nSo I tried to switch up my flow and just give you somethin’ that’s new\nOut comes Unexplored and finally got that positive review\nThat’s all I wanted was people to hear my shit and approve\nLike I ain’t askin’ for much, I know there’s room to improve\nBut I was happy that y’all were happy, that’s all I assumed\nNow I don’t know what is next, I can’t predict what’s the future\nBut I know just for a fact that beggars can never be choosers\nSo whatever’s comin’ in next, I hope it’s comin’ in sooner\n‘Cause who the fuck knows what can happen in a month or two, so honestly man it’s whatever\nConsider this as a letter\n‘Cause all this effort I put in is only makin’ me better\nUntil the floors collapse and bury more of my pressure\nThank you all for the support, sincerely yours, forever\nEmbed",
