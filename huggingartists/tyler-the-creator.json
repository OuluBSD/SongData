Like, is something wrong? Like, like, its like gut-wrenching. Its both beautiful—its very beautiful—but its like, parts that hurt a little bit, you know what I mean?\nTyler: Yeah its—man I was like... Cause for Cherry Bomb I purposely was like, I dont wanna get personal at all. Like Imma just make songs. This is all just, this is a song. And in this one I was like, Alright, let me write down every feeling.\nJ: Oh, you started with emotions?\nT: Just—just, a lot of them was just asking questions. A lot of the songs just have questions, its just like, How am I feeling today? Fuck, what if I go poor again? What if it doesnt work? And then thats how a lot of the songs just happened, just me kind of, just asking these quest—answering these questions, like, so...\nJ: But its speaking to, like, a mood you were in. Like—like you recorded this one, when did you...\nT: Um, mostly 2016—like I started to the end of 2015. A lot of spring, summer 2016, and then a lot of fall\nJ: What were you listening to? Like—\nT: Um...\nJ: Like watching and listening to?\nT: Pop music. I love—I was, like, listening to pop structure. Uh, kinda just what, like, Max Martin was doing and really getting into what, what Pharrell and Justin was doing—\nJ: Yeah...\nT: And, um, just noticing, just hooks. I uh—hanging out with Travis, Taco. I went to the club with him and just seeing what people, how people reacted to certain—\nJ: You never go to clubs!\nT: I hate em. But when I would go I would just study, Oh, that, that bass drop, or, Oh, that girl loves that part. Just like, Okay, I want to have a song that has that feeling. So I kind of was like, okay. I wanna see—challenge myself and try to make a few songs thats not like, Uh, rappity-rappy, or, super distorted, I was like... Last night, I went to—me and Lionel went to like a house party and they, they, all the songs they were playing—Señiorita by Justin, Tell Me by Total, Frontin by P—like, all these house partying songs. And See You Again came on, and its full of black people, that for sure go to clubs, and they were in there, like, singing the lyrics and I was like, Oh shit, Ive always wanted that.\nJ: To just have black people... dance...\nT: I, I did it. Yeah, yeah! I was so hyped, and I was—we were playing Jenga and I was being cool about it but inside I was like, Oh shit—\nJ: You were going crazy—\nT: I finally have something that they could do that to\nJ: Its funny because I guess I wouldnt have, uh, like thought about how much like pop is, you know, influenced in the album because, because of like the subject matter. Like, a lot of it is so heavy. Thats why I was just wondering, were you in like a place of just like...?\nT: Well, uh, you gotta feed, you put the—some people, old people say you put the medicine in like the uh, the candy—\nJ: The applesauce\nT: —Or the applesauce, whatever, so...\nLike, with Mr. Lonely I was like, Aw dude, I want to write the saddest song I could possibly write and see people go crazy, and like dance to it, its that. And at shows, that song is insane, and its the saddest song Ive ever wrote\nJ: Yeah it really is—and you dance—I mean its so hard, its so hard, and like the greatest, like, bridge ever! What was that—what was that? I dont know if we—I mean Im just gonna kind of jump into various songs—but like what, what was like, specifically that like... why that transition? Like, why did you think that was like, needed a transit—like was it, like it for emotional, like were you trying to create different moods?\nT: So, 911 and Mr. Lonely originally was, uh, a different song kind of together. It was this jazz take I had that was super triumphant and just sounded grand, and a lot of those lyrics was uh... was in that song and I just took em, and just placed them on 911 and then took the verse and placed it on Mr. Lonely and added some stuff. And, 911—the version that came out is the 25th version, it had...\nJ: Wait, the 25th version? You did 25 versions of that song?\nT: It was 24. The first version was over an interlude song that Tony Toni Toné had. I looped it, sang over that, liked the hook that I put there, made 30 beats for it. Its—and the versions arent just different type of lyrics, its literally like... different beats, different melodies, all that\nJ: A completely different vibe?\nT: Made that, took the beat from the fashion show I did, reworked that. Took the lyrics from the original Mr. Lonely and like, implementing it in that, and like, so the original Mr. Lonely its like, uh...\nA five car garage\nFull tank of gas\nA call for every day of the week and it go really fast\nBut it means nothing, nothing, nothing\nWithout you, shotgun\nJ: Yeah, yeah...\nT: Right yeah. Thats in the last version of 911...\nFive car garage\nFull tank of the gas\nBut that dont mean nothing, nothing\nNothing, nothing\nSo you kept that based on the previous, you just-\nTyler: Exactly, so I took it from this jazz song, and I was like, nah, I want them to groove to this shit, so I put it on that\nJerrod: I actually always wondered why that bit repeat-\nTyler: Well yeah it just cause it was from it was it was from the bass of the other one but when I put it there and drop the beat people I was like oh people are gonna love saying this. And if you see that shows I dont even say it I just put the mic and the whole -ten thousand people:  nothing, nothing, nothing.\nAnd Im like I figured it out and I-\nJerrod: You figured out—that, that feeling that you want, the feeling of just everybody really connecting with it but wait- specifically the bridge on that- what was like-\nTyler: Oh oh what the chirp chirp part?\nJerrod: I say bird- but like, which is the most one of the most addictive things-\nTyler: I aint made that, I remember I made that and it was just the beat and I remember stopping like I made the bridge that Ive always wanted to make. Lonny came by-or Frank however people know him- and he came by and I played it for him hes like you let me go in there Just try something he just started making phone noises and it worked out so perfectly and we was like alright and-\nJerrod: was it longer?\nTyler: no that part Im just giving niggas eight bars of these chords just so they could want it so they could replay it and left it at that\nJerrod: How did you balance out and this is kind of for the whole album your love of chords with-you always talk about and you always say niggas dont want chords and thats all youre obsessed with. Its just everything is specific and just-\nTyler: I just Want chords and melodies\nJerrod: Yeah. and was it like a battle- cause the whole album has chords\nTyler: Yeah, I fucked up-well I didnt fuck up but Cherry Bomb was an album full of bridges and shit going everywhere, so I was like, let me for this album specifically add all the chords I like but do it in a way that they can digest. So Mr. Lonely has some of the prettiest chords on the album, but I kinda hid it behind the hard drums and the fast paced rap, but if you really listen its really fucking pretty-\nOther: Rolling!\nTyler: Thank you. And I was like Im definitely gonna-just try to hide it in those and stuff. And 911 even the uh, call me some time. I was listening to Gap Band and I was like damn, these are simple chords and I love the melody let me try to implement it in this and make it as simple as possible but it still gives me that feeling. So the part where I was like fuck it Imma go crazy, I right before Steve Lacys part when it goes back to the hook and its like: dun, dun, dun ,dun ,dun and I was like Imma go on my Jill Scott shit and thats my favorite part of that song, just cause it just-\nJerrod: It has all the chords that you love\nTyler: Exactly\nJerrod: Umm, do you wanna...\nTyler: You could cut it now\nJerrod: I cant even lie... Where does the..\nTyler: I can just imagine a nigga in a wife-beater on Valentines Day like in the hood and like-\nJerrod: Is he talking to his friends or in the mirror-\nTyler: I dont know who hes talking to but its a quick shot like I cant even lie Ive been lonely as fuck nigga, just being honest with his homies or something, and I was like man that would be really funny to chant. But its the perfect set up for when that song comes on. It sets you up for like whats bout to happen. Its honest but its right here and they go crazy when they-\nJerrod: Its like so sad its hilarious. Its like there a group of niggas chanting-\nTyler: And thats Rocky. Thats Rocky yelling that. Thats Q, I think thats Wyatt, thats Lionel, thats Jasper-\nOther: Ah, dont talk, the camera..\nJerrod: Alright\nJerrod: Foreword is ah- ok, first of all, that tempo is very weird. Its like a really weird tempo that you found, was it kind of just like a challenge?\nTyler: Well so, thats a loop from this band called Can. Ive always been into krautrock, its like- it was a sound that was very European, like Eastern Europe, and you got like Can, The Silver Apples, even Soft Machine, which was this really proud jazz band that took influence around that time. And its kind of what Portis Head listens to for influence, and its something Ive always liked because its just so weird and just- this weird drum patterns and these haunting bass lines, and thats a song that they had and everytime I played it I would just rap over it. And I was like fuck it Imma loop it, add these-\nJerrod: Is it hard to rap over, just the-\nTyler: Not actually, Its actually just the one ,two, three, four but the pockets that they would use makes its sound like this weird push and pull back thing\nJerrod: Yeah it feels like your on something, you know what I mean? Just kinda pulls. Yeah and its like- that pocket is such- the pace of it, when youre rapping over it is you do a little bit faster than I would expect. Like a little bit more- why, why that song first? Why that mood though first? Where you trying to set a-?\nTyler: I remember making it like this need to be the first song. Just go in, just so you can see where Im at in my head, and I remember writing that verse fully like.... how much shit can I buy, till it gets boring like how many jumps can I do on a bike until Im over it and on to the next thing. And every answer that I had went to the next question, like was it ever enough.\nJerrod: it almost sounded it was so existential and contemplative and it almost sounded suicidal, especially the if Im going and dont come back- do you know what I mean? It was so dark its-\nTyler: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was the end question like damn, what if I died? What happen? And thats kinda what it was and just to set the tone of like thats where Im at. And its not depressed-Im not depressed at all. A lot of people mix up depression with self awareness. Someone was like dude this album is depressing and I was nah, I never said I was depressed. Im lonely, but Im having the most fun of my goddamn life. But that song kinda sets that tone\nJerrod: Ok, I mean if youre considering death, but its not from a depressed, sad state, is it from a state of like alright Ive got something to prove cause it almost seems like you had a thing to prove on this album. I dont know to yourself, or like-\nTyler: Well, a lot of people do stuff for the conversation of when theyre dead. Like hopefully, when I die people can say oh he-this, this and this, I leave a good discography behind, but-\nJerrod: Yeah, I like to start with every project, I like to start from death and work backwards\nTyler: Exactly\nJerrod: Its just like, were all gonna die someday\nTyler: I just knew that if this album wasnt good I would be fucked. Thats how I felt. And some people would disagree, but Im like, man Im nothing right now\nJerrod: You felt like that coming off of Cherry Bomb?\nTyler: Yeah yeah yeah, cause everyone hated it, except for like, real music lovers who care about drums- like I opened a rap album with a rock song. Most niggas was like uh. And then Buffalo comes and you can barely hear what Im saying, and then Pilot comes on and its this 80s music and theyre out cause they want rap. Then Run comes, dun, dun, and then Find Your Wings comes and theyre like this is chill, and then Cherry Bomb comes and just punches them-so theyre out and a lot of people didnt know how to take it so-\nBut Find Your Wings and stuff felt so- I dont even know if I mean lyrically, I mean sonically, going back to your love of chords and stuff like that and you would on Cherry Bomb it seems like you would have chords and distort it, like it was you were always running from it and covering it up, so that-saying its your most personal album, removed from the subject matter, it feels that way, like sonically\nTyler: Yeah, I fully get that yeah. never thought that\nJerrod: It just feels like a real- Okay so the sadness of Foreword that goes into almost the like- Im going to say almost this cockiness of Where This Flower Blooms. Do you feel like you were accepting yourself?\nTyler: So its a lot of things-and I dont wanna take credit-that I was doing that people were like, what is he doing, and then two years later its what everyones doing, whether its the way videos are done or these stupid pop-up things or whatever, and Im not taking credit, but I was doing that and no-one ever puts me on these lists or respects me in the sense that I wanted. So I was just, and thats why that line is like: Aint nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego but dont be too cool because I may freeze, and Im stuck in this egotistical mindset and I never move forward, and thats how niggas freeze to death, but that ice, shit weighs a ton, water your garden, my nigga and stunt. I got a flower chain made, with all these different things, and thats what I was talking about, but I was like, fuck these niggas, keep doing my shit, uh, and tell these black kids they can be who they are-\nJerrod: Thats one of my favorite lyrics, is just tell these black kids they can be who they are\nTyler: Dude, right!\nJerrod: Like its one of my favorite- you had another lyric like that on Cherry Bomb that was just like, the world is yours little nigga like my little nigga, the world is yours. Like I love that- like its a similar thing like, tell these black kids they can be who they are. Where you saying that to you or the people you see...?\nTyler: I was saying that to me to but it uh, its no-one saying that to kids that look like me, or anyone that looks like me. We had this conversation just wanting to snowboard when I was 12, but someone was like oh, thats white people shit. Black people dont do that. No, you dont do that, dont put a damper on me and tell me what I can a cant be just because of the way everyone else was thats my same color. And I just feel like I just wanted to tell them like be you-\nJ: Who you are is such the alternative of the expectations are placed on like a young black guy growing up. Like youre influenced by kind of everything, kinda all cultures, so do you think you accepted that by yourself through your music\nT: I knew who I was at like 12\nJ: I think you rapped maybe 28% on the album. Its like so-\nT: My goal for this album was to shut the fuck up, and let the all feature be the leader. Yes, Rex, here sing for two minutes before I come in with an 8 bar on Boredom and then Ill have another 8 bar but I wanna shut up and just let the string section be 2 minutes at the end.\nJ: Boredom I think-I found out about it this morning- Boredom right now, to me, is like your Billy Jean.\nT: Really?\nJ: It really is kind of a- seeing people connect with that song... That song influenced... I think I called you and said if I dont know this song is creating an emotion for me or if its like the soundtrack to something I already feel. Like thats how powerful I think it is\nT: Well, I wrote that, literally, it was a 5 pm on a Saturday, laying on my back, looking so bored. It was nothing to do, no-one was hitting me back, Jasper was in the other room, bored out of his mind but I didnt see him the whole day, my room was warm as hell because I like the heater on, and there was nothing to eat but dry cereal and Im sitting thinking what the fuck am I going to do? I literally wrote that verse in 10 seconds, cause again, it was these questions and these legit feelings of boredom that I was having. And it was weird to me cause its like... Im in a tax bracket where I can go do whatever. I have all these cars, I can go drive--but I have nowhere to go and Im just bored. And it was just confusing to me cause its like-\nJ: You dont understand how you could possibly--\nT: How the hell I could be bored when its... but there was nothing to do at the moment. So I was like, fuck it, Im gonna write a song about it\nJ: Jasper has to listen to that song and be like fuck you nigga I was right there\nT: I wrote the song over the chords of God Bless the Child by Stevie Wonder. I figured out the chords, looped it, and had it just playing for hours in my room. And I wrote the verse, which was like a 40 bar verse originally, but I cut it in half cause I was like the hook needs to come back. So, at the end of the first verse, its like Im... bored. I did that right when we was editing cause it went to the end of the verse, it was like, originally, Im bored and getting desperate. Phone is not-- It went straight to a different verse and it was a different pocket but I cut it, because I was like I need to put the hook back in here, cause I dont wanna hear myself\nJ: Yeah, cause its a weird chunk, just, Im... bored. Find some time!\nT: Uh huh. So I added that right when we was editing, finishing, I was like, No no no, fuck that, put the hook. Imma change the second verse a little bit and like, so the pocket is easier to rap so everyone could say it. Cause it was too rapitty, you know, and I was like, nobody wanna hear this deep ass voice rap for that long; let me shut the fuck up and do a hook, so all the white girls at Coachella can sing this shit\nT: And, Im not lying, doing festivals, you realize white people love singing along to shit\nT: Thats why, the fucking, Boredom is two minutes of just this like...\nDirector: Roll up!\nJ: When you perform this album live, you start on Where This Flower Blooms, usually. Is it a longer intro?\nT: Yeah yeah yeah, so... I wanted this album to sound like a Disney score. Just like, very magical. My perfect little indie movie, and, fucking...\nJ: Sound like the album cover looks\nT: Yeah, sound like the album cover looks like. But, it turned into, you know, what it turned into. Where This Flower Blooms had this very beautiful longer intro, I shortened it a bit, but, it sound like the beginning of a movie\nJ: Its sweeping and...\nT: Yeah, I start the shows with that because its like bringing them into my world and then it drops and gets crazy but... yeah\nJ: How long did you-- why did you trim it and not just go-\nT: I just wanted to cut the fucking fat. I wanted this album to be no longer that 45 minutes. And I think we hit 45:36 or 46 minutes and I was like, okay, cool. I just want it to be short and get to the point and yeah\nJ: You were talking about questions and how every song is sparked by a... thing. My favourite sequence of this-- of these songs, but... uh, Pothole is inspired by something your mom said to you. Is that like...\nT: A long time ago she was like, yo, some people just arent really as loyal or close to you as you think. And Im always like, shut the fuck up, like, what the fuck are you talking about? Sometimes moms know best and I had to find out on my own, like, oh wow, she wasnt wrong about that person. And I kind of wrote that verse like: My mom told me, blah blah blah. And, uh...\nJ: So you singing that more? You started singing that more\nT: Yeah, and even like, I did it in the car like, I drove back to the points where she told me specifically. Like, when you make three lefts it makes it right. So like, I triple left tryna double back. And the streets are filled with clues that she told me\nJ: And thats great, that some of your best--\nT: But, how I aint notice that. And I see some familiars, I see some people I knew, stuck in the cul-de-sac. I pull up, get out, what up, I wanna help you. But what you want for some people they dont want for themselves. So, do I stay here and try to figure it out, or do I go, and traffic is picking up? And if I dont leave now and get on my path and do what I need to do, Imma be stuck, and", "Listen\nBad ass bitch, big ass titties man\nGot a fucking AK size of a fucking mini-van\nListen \nYall niggas got problems, then yall do it\nI got so much fucking money in my pockets I fucking walk stupid\nHold up \nBad bitch look good in some nice pants\nBut my bitch look good in some nice pants\nNiggas see me they be like shit god damn AK-47 tucked in that nigga nice pants, hold up\nYall got a little nigga started on some G shit\nWho that nigga that looked swagged out?\nTHATS ME BITCH\nDont play with a niggas money or his fucking family \nI got little niggas one named Johnathan and one named Tammy\nYall niggas got a fucking problem say it to my fucking face\nGot little niggas that will sock you in the fucking face\nAnd if you think they wont sock you in the fucking face\nYou a bit- \nPop you right in your fucking face", "Im in the room with 7 titties, thats 4 bitches with one missin\nWith eleven twisted up Sherbinskis, some Bodillaz\nHer 450, cookin dope in a gold skillet\nBumpin old 50, hit my robe with the gold stichin\nIn my gold kitchen, gold bitches with painted toes tippin\nAll these bitches taste like chicken, cant name a hoe different\nProlific, was zip-flippin and kickin door-hinges\nPO done snitched to the boys, he said we all did it\nAugmented my lifestyle, so now we all livin\nGet my dick sucked right now, while in the stall, pissin\nBald bitches with car skimmers splittin cigars with us\nCouldnt carry us like pallbearers with they paws missin\nTargetin pussy niggas, hit em with arsenic\nStarvin, bitch, hit the kitchen, make something marvellous\nPartial splits, I cant get with; bitch, I need all of it\nAUG equipped, get to spittin, hit up your cardigan\nDont make me pull up and do you like room raiders\nThrow your bitch in a cage and line it with newspapers\nDouble up, think I love her, but dont play us like dual Segas\nFore your people search for your body like fuckin Tomb Raider\nUnh, Im Voldemort with the whore, dont wan smell her pussy\nNo conversations with shorty, give her emails to book me\nI break a bitch and make her do 17 like Cookie\nIf Im sentenced, conjugal visits and dope in her coochie\nYeah, uh-huh, okay, okay\nBlack negroes, San Pellegrinos, Gabbana Dolces\nTax 3 Os, beat a nigga like he a court case\nFeel like Max Keeble, Filipino bitches my forte\nUnh, yeah, uh huh, okay, okay\nBlack negroes, San Pellegrinos, Gabbana Dolces\nTax 3 Os, beat a nigga like he a court case\nFeel like Max Keeble, Filipino bitches my forte\nGet behind that bitch like an investment\nThe game more hectic cause I blessed it\nWhen I dont want it no more, I neglect it\nCant even neglect what aint my possession, number one lesson\nThese niggas soft and sweet as big Texas, so get the message\nPillow Pet ass niggas, strap concealed under my shirt\nSo all you see is silhouettes and black figures\nShoot him in his back, nigga, so when they turn him over\nHe easy to recognize like tagged pictures, we blacklist him\nBag him, toe-tag him, and wrap him up like Christmas\nPull all his teeth out like the dentist, now he need dentures\nIm the boy with the frozen soul, I come alive in the winter\nDont eat around me, when Im hungry, Ill take your dinner\nLike, bruh, man, I hate to see niggas guts go splat in public\nWhen I bust it, but fuck it, this snub love it\nPissin out windows when we couldnt afford buckets\nNow a wrist out the window and glist on my bicuspids\nPlay the bitch, you niggas get split like vanilla Dutches\nHe the snitch, throw the chump in the trunk like he the luggage\nGave him tits, you should not wear jewelry, so, nigga, tuck it\nFake niggas dont got our blood in they genes, they step-cousins\nYeah, uh-huh, okay, okay\nBlack negroes, San Pellegrinos, Gabbana Dolces\nTax 3 Os, beat a nigga like he a court case\nFeel like Max Keeble, Filipino bitches my forte\nUnh, yeah, uh-huh, okay, okay\nBlack negroes, San Pellegrinos, Gabbana Dolces\nTax 3 Os, beat a nigga like he a court case\nFeel like Max Keeble, Filipino bitches my forte", "Are you livin?

Seeing Everyone I Care About There Was Crazy. No, Thats Not Even The Part That Got Me Excited. Seeing What Some Stupid Little ideas Can Turn Into Is What Shocks Me.

Not That You Care, But That Fact That I Figured Out How To Get That Thing And Ride It For As Many Times As I Want Without Waiting In Line IS Fucking Amazing\nI Have An Amazing Team With Me. No Matter How Crazy And Offensive Or Weird My Ideas Were, They Put Their Trust In Me And Allowed Me To Move Forward.Like Dude, We Threw A Fucking Carnival In The Middle Of Los Angeles With 10k Plus People. We Didnt Have Any Crazy Sponsors And I Didnt Have To Suck Up to Anyone Or Any Of That Shit, WE Did It. And The Skatepark? Did You See That Skatepark? I Was Up Till 2 Am Painting That Bitch! Growing Up In Hawthorne At The Dirty And Seeing My Old Friends From There Getting Clips Was Prolly The Craziest Shit Ive Seen. How Far Ive Came With Every Little Idea that I Believed In No Matter Who Did Or Didnt. Walking Around Seeing Kids In EXACT Things That I Wear Is Mind Blowing. Something That I Just Naturally Like And Put On, Its Some Kid Out There That Studies Every Article Of Clothing That Was Put On And Emulates That. Thats Crazy To Me. I Used To Do That With P, So Know That Someone IS Looking At Me The Way I Look At Him Is Really Amazing To Me\nI Didnt Think I Would Change So Many Lives. Someone Retweeted An Old Tweet Of Mine From Feb 2012 Yesterday And It Read ’ I Had A Dream That Kanye Invited Me To Perform LATE With Him. I Wish’. Kanye Came To The Carnival And I Performed Late With Him. My Favorite Song By Kanye, AN Album Cut He NEVER Does, Was Performed Not Only With But During My Set And My Carnival! No Matter if You Hate Me Think Im Stupid Untalented Annoying Or Whatever, I FUCKING WIN AND YOU CAN SUCK MY WHOLE SHIT. We Did This, OF Did This, Coming From Actually Jack Shit And Turned That Jack Shit In Something. I’m Just Blabbing Now.

The cockroach climbs to his other hand, and Tyler stares at it intently as he raps.\nIt crawls over his hand, and then onto his other hand again. Tyler brings his hand up and looks down on the cockroach, and we see the word Kill written in sharpie on the back of his hand. We also see an upside-down cross drawn on his middle knuckle.\nThe cockroach climbs to the edge of his hand and it crawls onto his other hand, and Tyler stares at the camera.\nTyler brings the hand with the cockroach down, out of the view of the camera. He brings it back up in between his fingers and puts it in his mouth.\nHe chews, and the camera begins panning out, bringing Tyler in and out of focus. He makes a face of disgust, and stands up from the stool, heaving.\nTyler becomes a silhouette, and he throws up onto the floor. It takes a while, and then he wipes his mouth and spits onto the floor. He sits up on the stool and he comes back into focus.\nHe begins rapping again, pausing to spit on the ground again.

He grabs his face in rage, showing that he is wearing a chain. He then takes his shirt off all the way.\nThe camera zooms in to Tylers face, with the image becoming extremely blurry and then in sharp focus. We see that Tylers eyes are dark black, and then we see only Tylers teeth, then his eyes again. Tyler gives the camera the middle finger.\nTyler begins to move around a lot, agitated, grabbing his chain. He becomes completely out of view at one point, then when he comes back into view, his nose begins to bleed. He wipes the blood off his top lip.\nThe camera zooms out, and a noose falls from the ceiling. Tyler grabs the noose and wraps it around his neck. He stands on the stool, and we only see his feet.\nThe stool falls over, and the legs begin thrashing, as Tyler hangs from the noose . His legs twitch as his legs swing back and forth.\nThe camera moves to see the stool on the ground and Tylers feet dangling. The feet finally stop twitching, and they just sway around in a circle.

I easily coulda hired a lady who sings opera or got one of the female singers who hits runs and coulda, Im runnin Im runnin, just to emulate a string, but, I know Toro would do it perfect, and he does high pitch, like, he can do high, he can do low, he has such a middle thats really good too, so I just stacked all of em and... It came out perfect\nToro y Moi plays the chords to FUCKING YOUNG on his guitar\nThose chords are gorgeous. I cant do without em. The day that I met Tony-\nYo, yo yo yo yo!

Imma use it throughout the song, but thats like the important part.

And I got to see his secret little stuff in his secret little room\nLike, you cant make the same sound\nNo, exactly, and thats what I love, is its totally unpredictable\nIs this the one where you just plug in shit?\nYes\nOh my god\nAnd theres a whole back wall.

Hes my fucking favorite ever, I love him so much. Hes a shermhead\nI produced a song off his first album, I mean, weve been homies ever since, hes one of the only few rappers I fuck with, and I had made this beat, it sounded like, schizophrenic shermhead, whatever you wanna call it, automatically thought that the tone of voice ScHoolboy Q has would just sound ridiculous over it. I hit him up, he came at night, knocked his shit out in an hour. Bam\nNigga that really makes me sad\nTYLER AND SCHOOLBOY Q RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD CA 2015\nScHoolboy Q records his verse on Brown Stains\nWe gotta do it again.

Shout out to Tyler, we got the same car, its tight\nWhen Im not making a song I can drive fast to or wild out on stage, Im tryna figure out the right chords and melodies\nSINGERS\nTiffany Palmer, Onitsha Shaw and Samantha Nelson record their part for Find Your Wings\nI feel like rap has a timestamp on it. You could listen to My Cheri Amor by Stevie Wonder any time frame, ever. A five-year-old could listen to it. A eighty-year-old could listen to it. Its less boundaries with singing songs\nKeeping ALL the fuckups too\nMy boy Austin, whos in a band called Slow Hollows, is really sick with guitar. Hes playing on three songs on the album, and the things that Ive learned from him, just over the years made me more comfortable, with who I am, and the things that I like, and just learning more stuff, and what keeps things fresh is just, new energy, and, not getting complacent and stuck. Working with these three girls was just amazing, they knew exactly what I wanted, and then in unison, they just sounded together, and they were open, and they- they made me feel comfortable\nKALI & TYLER RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD TUESDAY 11 PM\nOh, my names Kali Uchis, usually he already has something ready and hell already have an idea, most of the time he writes everything, or hell have a melody idea. Obviously he produces everything, so he really hones in on making sure everything is exactly how he wants it to be. Cause, when I met him, I had just started singing, I feel like I was still really learning about my voice. He definitely made me a lot more comfortable and experiment more with my range. I think what I admire most about Tyler, how dedicated he is, how much he really wants to make something meaningful thats gonna be lasting, rather than make something that, you know, will get to radio, or, will be, something that people listen to right now, and then maybe goes away later, I dont think hes ever really cared about trends, or, um, he just kind of follows what he wants to do, and, um, he works really hard\nUnreleased song plays \nClem records her part for OKAGA, CA\nOKAGA, CA is my favorite song on that album, and probably, to me personally, in my top five songs in my discography\nI remember hearing Clem a long time ago, and her voice stood out to me so much. It was so high pitched, and like, it almost had this kid-like vibe to it, to where it was just fun, and she was just like- it had no worries in it\nPretend, youre Tido and Jermaine?, to youre Michael Jackson leads, so you youre own backup singers\nYou know, she comes from this rock background, so to have her singing in a soul cadence, was really interesting to me. Its not many people who know how to hit those registers and riffs that I love. Me and Frank talk about it all the time, its few people like Kim Burrell is one that we always bring up, Jasmine Sullivan, um, Alice Smith, I which- uh, shes on the OKAGA, CA song on the album, too\nALICE SINGS\nIm Syd, Ive known Tyler since I think 2008, so that would be 8 years. The biggest thing that Ive learned from working with Tyler is to trust your ideas. I dont agree with all of his ideas, but when somebody, like, trusts themselves that much, makes you question yourself if you dont like it, and thats what I really got from him\nSYD SINGS\nBut working with Charlie Wilson, that was a whole nother story\nFUCKING YOUNG\nI dont think Ive ever been this stressed making a song. Charlie Wilson took what I had in my head and made it come to fruition so perfectly, that I started stressing out on the fact that I could never do anything that good\nCHARLIE RECORDS\nWhat the fuck, I hate this. Laughs I fully, I fully cant take this\nHes a legend, and him taking cues from we was so weird\nCHARLIE SINGS HIS PART FOR FUCKING YOUNG\nFUCKING YOUNG VIDEO SHOOT\nIm so sorry!

I remember playing it for Travis and Lionel, and we was like oh, shit, like, I really got these two niggas on a song\nFuckin fire!\nAnd I knew specifically, I wanted Waynes tone of voice on there\nI kinda- He texted me, just like, Man, I got this joint. Hes like a, perfectionist, so hes one of those guys that you know, you, he want, he know exactly what he want from you. Might fuck around and write your verse for you\nSo, I told him I wanted him over, and he was like, alright, cool. I sent him my parts with his parts out, and then he just laid his shit down, and it was great by then. Went to Ye house, played it for him, he was like, cool. Wayne sent me his shit the day after I played it, I went back the day after Wayne sent it and played it for Ye again, and he heard me and Wayne verse, and he was like shakes his head ripped his paper out of his notebook, balled it up, and started a new, and it was ideas on there, and he was like, Yall niggas really bout to make me rap and go in, like, I aint had niggas makin me want to do that in so long\nFirst of all, Tyler changed the game. Maybe I probably had online, and I knew- I wouldnt say because people might think it was too gross to put in a rap, or it didnt go with the whole vibe", "Yeaaaah bitch\nWolf Gang\nSweatshirt, uh\nHo\nNinety-four rap music, beat a preachers ass to it\nPigeon blood will leave the stool wall shitted up\nShit talk myrtle fuck, get your sister fucked\nShit, i hit the stripper up then go and pick a stick inside the fucking pots where we brew them bitches up\nRip your writtens while my niggas splitting, splitting blunts\nEyes hazed with my middle finger up a strippers cunt\nLights down, lit her up, sherm in my sippy cup\nIce picking cripples till I get my pickle rub\nCatch me popping pimples, telling bitches triple 6s\nStab em with pencils in their temples till my dick erupts\nIts really fucking simple, slut\nWolf Gang, get with us\nEither that or grab a full fist of nuts and lick em up\nTurn it up, fisticuffs, give them bitches dick to suck\nLet them drink the cum out of fucking paper cup\nPours wider than the horse that Im sniffing up\nLeave now if you aint tryna get em titties touched", "I aint scared of you motherfuckers\nIma tell you something straight off the motherfucking press\nI aint coming for no foolishness\nAnd New York goddammit yall motherfucking women look good\nYall like a bacon and egg sandwich, you look good\nAnd I love sex, I love it\nCant do shit no more and Im blessed\nIm big bone-ded, Im heavy structured\nIm hung low\nIf I pull my shit out, this whole room get dark\nKick it\nYuh\nUh, Im jinglin, baby, go head, bitch\nI said Im jinglin, baby, go head, dawg\nI said Im jinglin, baby, go head, bitch\nI said Im jinglin, ayo\nJingle, jingle, thats a one of one \nDiamonds flooded like its Katrina \nPlease do not make me cop that P1 \nTrust me, that is something you dont want, yeah, mm\nGolf le Fleur like I heal, mm\nOrange bottom, no high heels, mm\nLast five months, thats five mils, mm\nStill too scared to cop the P1\nDont you get that heat, one of one, be one \nEB1, and he won, thats how we gun\nHe be one, the B1, the heebie-jeebies \nPlease do not, dont make me cop that P1\nGot the my percent, no \n my chick like Im a , no \nI dont know that shit, none of my shit go \nIm a ten out ten, Im on my tiptoes \nRun, run, run, wait, wait, mm\nIm on , mm\nYou dont know what were coppin, mm\nIm on , the , mm\nUh, Im jinglin, baby, go head, bitch\nI said Im jinglin, baby, go head, dawg\nI said Im jinglin, baby, go head, bitch\nI said Im jinglin, ayo \nJingle, jingle, thats a one of one \nDiamonds flooded like its Katrina \nPlease do not make me cop that P1 \nTrust me, that is something you dont want, yeah, mm \nBoom, guess who stepped in the room\nTomb, make my Rari go vroom\nGot the P1, my Ruger P9\nI slide the east side and do the G side\nThug the B-side, throwin no peace sign\nFuckin three 9s, turn it to three dimes\n, Im chillin with two dimes\n one time, they fuckin me one time, ayy\nGet no blunts out the face, ayy \nLeave them, ghost out the fade , ayy \nPlease do not soak my parade, ayy \n hip-hop horray \nYeah, A$AP Rocky\nA$AP Rocky, A$AP Rocky, A$AP Rocky \nUh, Im jinglin, baby, go head, bitch\nI said Im jinglin, baby, go head, dawg\nI said Im jinglin, baby, go head, bitch\nI said Im jinglin, ayo\nJingle, jingle, thats a one of one \nDiamonds flooded like its Katrina \nPlease do not make me cop that P1 \nTrust me, that is something you dont want, yeah, mm\nNow how it go, with that roll when Im trippin the ten\nI tell her go, when to go, I might send her the top\nYeah, yeah, yeah, ride, ride, ride\nUh, uh, uh, ah, ah, ah\nGot that wood, ride, ride, ride\nFuck that shit, thats a Glock\nNow how that go, with that roll when Im trippin the top\nAnd got that hoe wanna go, Is on my shit in the ten\nHahaha, dun-dun-dun\nYeah, yeah, yeah, that that huh\nUh, uh, uh, ma, ma, ma\nNuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, uh uh\nTell em, baby, you tell em\n champagne \n with a nigga\n Kick it up \n Kick it up \n Kick it up \n Kick it up \nYuh", "Chilling at the house on a couch with the box crayons and a line of cocaine\nMy nose is on fire like a button with propane, its dripping all red of old gangs\nAnd now youve seen your stars and your face numb like a funny bone cupping at ice\nAnd your nose white like your heads covered in lice\nBut we both dazed, and I think I found my wife\nDazed and Amazed and Im dazed and Im blown\nDazed and Amazed and Im dazed and Im gone\nDazed and Amazed and Im dazed and Im home\nChilling at the house on the couch, nose white\nMind is travelling, thoughts is mental\nIm trying to get into your pus just like a pimple\nAnd I wait for the Cat in the Hat to pop through the window\nThe opium is in slow\nThin Though\nPut My Brim Low\nLet the lights dim low", "You on the internet and shit and uh... these motherfuckers be posting videos of songs like: Uh, oh, uh, this the motherfucking blame it on the throne freestyle.

The atmosphere backstage before their Sydney show was beyond hyper - different members of Odd Future would come and go, and everyone was yelling, beating each other up and throwing chairs across the room. It was a little bit intimidating but mostly exciting, and reminded us of those high school drama classes where everyone just wanted to be the centre of attention.Ingrid Kesa: The theme of this issue is Hang Out In Real Life.

Hes one of my best friends, also one of my worst.\nIngrid: There were 14-year-olds smoking cigarettes out the front of the show before - do you think thats cool?\nTyler: No. Thats something Im so against -- smoking. I dont smoke at all. I think that cigarettes are actually retarded. I dont understand why people do that to themselves.\nIngrid: Have you come across any Australian snacks that you really like?\nTyler: Golden Gaytimes! I love the Golden Gaytimes in my mouth!\nEarl: You know what I dont like thats Australian? Vegemite.\nIngrid and Hayley: Boooo!\nTyler: You fucking weirdos. Your breakfast is weird too.

You have fucking slabs of ham steak.\nIngrid: What would you cook a girl for dinner?\nTyler: Waffles, bacon, eggs...\nEarl: A breakfast sandwich.\nIngrid: Whats a breakfast sandwich?\nEarl: Its just where you get eggs, cheese and bacon.

Youre being passive aggressive.\nEarl: if you had to hit your mom in the head or a baby in the head with a baseball bat, which one would you choose?\nIngrid: Hayley -- shed bounce back.\nTyler: Would you rather that she gets stabbed in the face by a mugger named Jonathan or would you spit in a babys mouth and face and throw shit at it?\nIngrid: Id spit in the babys mouth -- birds do that -- and it wouldnt hurt.\nTyler: Damn, she really loves you! She really loves you. Hey, thats love. To spit and throw bricks and shit at a baby.\nIngrid: bricks? No! Whats the next question?\nTyler: You like these questions, because youre in love with her.

IMM ranges in different styles and sounds and I believe thats why I gravitated to it so much. The upright bassline on “Can I Have It Like That” or the buckets on “How Does It Feel”. Off the wall MJ on “Number 1″. I still to this day dont think I can make a song better than “That Girl”. And “I Really Like You Girl” is easily the best song on this album with your best Timberlake impersonation and Stevie harmonica. IMM also includes “Raspy Shit” which is the worst song in your discography I hate that song so much you are so gross for that. But the one that stood out was “You Can Do It Too”. The sade bassline, the string pad with chords that you claim only Q-Tip, you and I like, the Jamie Cullum outro!\nBeing 15 black not really “interested” in what the majority of my peers were into, it made me feel safe. I was optimistic, always daydreaming and setting goals so I felt you were directly speaking to me. I remember clancy telling me how Jimmy Iovine thought this album was a “complete fucking failure it didnt work”. But see, it did, just not on the kids he was looking at. The ones who just existed; used the popular slang; listened to what was thrown at them; dressed in clothing that was trending at the time. Not saying thats bad but of course this wouldnt work on them. But it worked on me and I created Odd Future that same summer. I was actually naive enough to believe you and thought I could do all these amazing things if I really tried.\nWhere I grew up, niggas get stuck and never make it out. Jail, dead, shit jobs, not really growing. It seems like at a certain age, ideas; original thoughts are no longer a thing; I didnt fall into that cycle.

You were the first person I contacted when I pulled off that McLaren dealership!\nThis is getting long so uhhh, hbd IMM.
