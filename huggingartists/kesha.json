For the past ten years, Dr. Luke has sexually, physically, verbally, and emotionally abused Ms. Sebert to the point where Ms. Sebert nearly lost her life. Dr. Luke abused Ms. Sebert in order to destroy her self-confidence, self-image, and self-worth so that he could maintain complete control over her life and career.\n4. Dr. Lukes corporate business entities, Kasz Money, Inc., Prescription Songs, LLC, Kemosabe entertainment, LLC, and Kemosabe Records, LLC, have taken no action against him, have engaged in efforts to cover up his conduct and have continued their business relationships with him despite knowledge of his despicable conduct. Defendants Kasz Money, Inc., Prescription Songs, LLC, Kemosabe Entertainment, LLC, and Kemosabe Records, LLC have ratified Dr. Lukes unlawful conduct.\n5. Defendants conduct has and continues to put Ms. Seberts life at risk.THE PARTIESVENUE AND JURISDICTIONSTATEMENT OF FACTSKESHA ROSE SEBERT FROM NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE16. Plaintiff Kesha Rose Sebert grew up in Nashville, Tennessee. At eighteen years old, she was an intelligent, family-oriented, and joyful young woman. Ms. Sebert was enrolled in the prestigious International Baccalaureate program at her high school, audited classes at the nearby university, and had nearly perfect SAT scores. Ms. Sebert excelled academically and had a bright future ahead of her.\n17. Defedant Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald , a music producer, met Ms. Sebert and immediately recognized her musical talents. He pursued Ms. Sebert and showered her with promises of fame and fortune. He eventually convinced eighteen year-old Ms. Sebert to drop out of high school, leave her life behind, and move to Los Angeles, California in order to pursue what Dr. Luke represented would be a glamorous music career under his auspices. In 2005, shortly after Ms. Sebert had turned eighteen, Dr. Luke signed her to his music production company.DR. LUKES ABUSIVE BEGINNINGS WITH MS. SEBERT18. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Ms. Sebert soon realized that Dr. Luke was not the mentor he represented himself to be and the opportunities were not what he had promised they would be. Dr. Luke was preoccupied with the careers of other artists, those who were more high profile and lucrative. Dr. Luke provided no time, guidance, or support for Ms. Seberts music career, ultimately leaving her career to languish.\n19. A far cry from a mentor, Dr. Luke displayed despicable conduct in front of MS. Sebert. Specifically, Dr. Luke would boast and brag to Ms. Sebert about how he liked to take girls out on a first date, get them as drunk as possible, and fuck them in the ass.\n20. When Dr. Lukes wife became pregnant, he demanded that she get an abortion, and tried to blackmail her into an abortion by not speaking to her for six months and threatening to leave her if she refused an abortion. While his wife was pregnant and he was demanding an abortion, Dr. Luke would go out to parties at nightclubs and engage in explicit sexual activities with other females, including performing digital penetration on women in public at these clubs. Dr. Lukes conduct and statements about his conduct to Ms. Sebert were designed to intimidate and torment the young Ms. Sebert and to desensitize her so that Dr. Luke could eventually engage in the same type of despicable and prurient conduct with Ms. Sebert.\n21. Soon after moving to Los Angeles, Dr. Luke began to violently abuse the young Ms. Sebert, who was now uprooted from her hometown, isolated from her family and friends, and alone in Los Angeles. Dr. Luke continuously made sexual advances towards Ms. Sebert. He forced Ms. Sebert to take drugs and alcohol in order to take advantage of her sexually while she was intoxicated. Ms. Sebert later found out that the Dr. in the pseudonym Dr. Luke stemmed from Dr. Luke dealing drugs to entertainers during his ten-year tenure as a guitarist in the Saturday Night Live band.\n22. Dr. Luke sexually, physically, and verbally abused Ms. Sebert for a decade in order to make her feel completely worthless and maintain complete control over their life. On one occasion, Dr. Luke forced Ms. Sebert to snort an illicit drug before they were scheduled to take a flight. Once on the plane, Dr. Luke continuously forced himself on Ms. Sebert while she was intoxicated and drugged. Ms. Sebert was in such an intoxicated state on the plane that she vomited on herself during the flight.\n23. On another occasion, after forcing Ms. Sebert to drink with him, Dr. Luke instructed Ms. Sebert to take what he described as sober pills in order for her to sober up. Ms. Sebert took the pills and woke up the following afternoon, naked in Dr. Lukes bed, sore and sick, with no memory of how she got there. Ms. Sebert immediately called her mother and made a fresh complaint, telling her that she was naked in Dr. Lukes hotel room, she did not know where her clothes were, that Dr. Luke had raped her, and that she needed to go to the emergency room. Ms. Sebert later learned that the sober pills Dr. Luke had given her were actually a form of gamma-hydroxybutyrate , more commonly known as the date rape drug, allowing him to bring Ms. Sebert back to his hotel room alone and rape her while she was unconscious.\n24. Dr. Luke repeatedly threatened that if she ever told anyone about these abusive incidents, he would destroy both Ms. Sebert and her entire family. Specifically, after he drugged and raped Ms. Sebert, Dr. Luke took her down to the beach alone to have a talk with her. He threatened that if she ever mentioned the rape to anyone, he would shut her career down, take away all her publishing and recording rights, and otherwise destroy not only her life but her entire familys lives as well. He also threatened her and her familys physical safety. Ms. Sebert wholly believed that Dr. Luke had the power and money to carry out his threats; she therefore never dared talk about, let alone report, what Dr. Luke had done to her.\n25. Ms. Sebert endured years of unrelenting abuse at the hands of Dr. Luke. After a while, Dr. Luke made her feel that she deserved to be treated this way and it was her fault for forcing him to behave like he did. The constant abuse became the norm in Ms. Sebert life.MS. SEBERT BEGINS HER RECORDING CAREER26. In late 2008, Ms. Sebert believed that she was finally getting her big break. Dr. Luke needed a female vocalist for the song Right Round which he was working on with the recording artist Flo Rida. He enlisted Ms. Sebert for the female vocals and Right Round became an international hit, as well as number on eon the Billboards charts in the United States in 2009. Despite Ms. Sebert contribution to the song, Dr. Luke left her uncredited on the song. Ms. Sebert has never been compensated for her contribution to Right Round.\n27. In 2010, Ms. Seberts debut album, Animal, was released. the album was a huge success, and in the same year, it was ceritifed platinum for having sold over a million copies within the United States. Her debut single, Tik Tok, received multi-platinum certification in over a dozen countries. Having gained international recognition, Ms. Sebert, or rather Ke$ha, soon became a household name.DR. LUKES CONTINUED ABUSE AND CONTROL OVER MS. SEBERT28. Despite Ms. Seberts hard work and success, Dr. Luke continued to drill into her how worthless she was and how inferior she was compared to the other recording artists he works with. He constantly insulted her songwriting, vocals, clothing, body, and appearance, as being far below his standards, as well as Hollywood standards.\n29. Nevertheless, due to Ms. Seberts growing success, Dr. Luke recognized that he could continue to use her not only for his sexual interests, but also for substantial financial gain. He would tell Ms. Sebert that she was nothing but his pawn, and if she did not obey his orders, that he would end her career.\n30. Dr. Luke constantly made false promises to Ms. Sebert, such as promises to renegotiate her contract after her first album was released. Dr. Luke was well-aware that it is customary in the music industry to renegotiate the terms of a new artist agreement when that artist becomes a success, especially when an artist gained the platinum level success that Ms. Sebert had on her first album. Yet, despite promising to do so for over one and a half years, Dr. Luke always refused to sign the renegotiated contract at the last minute, blaming it on Ms. Sebert or her familys actions for his unwillingness to sign. Dr. Lukes failure to carry out his promises to renegotiate and improve the terms of Ms. Seberts contract is inconsistent with the industry standard and was done merely to exert his control over Ms. Sebert, manipulate her, and undermine her self-esteem. To date, Dr. Luke has not provided Ms. Sebert the benefit of the improved terms he promised for her second album, Warrior, such as increased artist advances and royalties customary for a platinum-selling artist.\n31. Dr. Luke sought to shatter Ms. Seberts self-confidence so that she would remain under his control. Dr. Luke consistently bombarded Ms. Sebert with insults such as:\n You are not that pretty, you are not that talented, you are just lucky to have me.\n I dont give a shit if you dont want to sing it, get in there and do it.\n Did you go party last night because you sound like shit.\n Go finish the song so I can buy a yacht.\n There are a million other girls out there like you.\n You are nothing without me.\n32. Dr. Luke cruelly and incessantly criticized Ms. Seberts weight, including blatantly doing so in front of other people purely to humiliate Ms. Sebert. He repeatedly instructed her to stop eating and lose weight. Dr. Luke would call Ms. Sebert a fat fucking refrigerator.\n33. Dr. Luke fully controlled the content of Ms. Seberts albums. Dr. Luke refused to include any lyrics, songs, or content he disapproved of, irrespective of Ms. Seberts feelings on the matter. In the same token, he forced Ms. Sebert to sing lyrics and songs that she did not wish to include in her albums. He told her that regardless of what she did, he would just edit the songs in a way that would make it appear as though Ms. Sebert had sung the lyrics herself. He unilaterally released Ms. Seberts songs form her albums as singles on the radio without her knowledge, consent, or input. In addition to holding exclusive control of her music publishing company, Prescription Songs, LLC, to exclusively control her services as a songwriter. Dr. Luke would threaten Ms. Sebert that he would take away her publishing rights to her own songs if she refused to follow his orders. Ms. Sebert had no say and no control over any aspect of her life where Dr. Luke was involved.\n34. Dr. Luke also constantly made threats regarding Ms. Seberts family in order to torture her as part of his emotional abuse. He would force her to obey his orders, or else threaten to take Ms. Seberts songwriting partner, her mother, off of Ms. Seberts songs and albums. Dr. Luke also forced himself into an executive role on Ms. Seberts reality television series, which was created by Ms. Seberts brother. Dr. Luke extorted money from the show and from Ms. Seberts brother by threatening to block the rights to and/or to remove the show from the air if he was not paid the amounts he desired. Dr. Luke even threatened to put down Ms. Seberts dog if the dog came near him during a recording session.\n35. At one point, during a meeting at his Malibu house, Dr. Luke attacked Ms. Sebert with these threats, screaming and violently thrashing his arms at her. He physically backed Ms. Sebert into a corner, where she curled up into a ball, crying and fearing for her life. In a frightened and frantic attempt to escape, Ms. Sebert fled Dr. Lukes house barefoot, ran down Pacific Coast Highway over rocks and broken glass on the ground, climbed up the nearby mountains, and hid there so that Dr. Luke would not be able to find her.\n36. Dr. Luke warned Ms. Sebert that strike one was that she hired a manager other than the one he had picked out for her, and that strike two was when Ms. Sebert held out from recording her second album so that Dr. Luke would carry out his promise to sign the renegotiated contract. Ms. Sebert was terrified that revealing the truth about Dr. Luke would be her final strike.\n37. Not only did Dr. Luke commit heinous acts against Ms. Sebert for a decade, but Dr. Luke repeatedly threatened that if she ever told anyone about these incidents, he would shut her career down, take away all her publishing and recording rights, an otherwise destroy not only her life but her entire familys lives as well. He threatened to harm Ms. Sebert and her entire familys careers as well as their physical safety. Ms. Sebert wholly believed that Dr. Luke had the power and money to carry out his threats and she felt she was unable to protect herself or her family. Broken, damaged, and traumatized by the constant abuse and the threats of financial ruin and physical harm to her and family, Ms. Sebert never dared talk about, let alone report, Dr. Lukes abusive and illegal acts.\n38. As a result, Ms. Sebert lived in constant fear of Dr. Luke. She lived in a prison of his abuse and was terrified of speaking, messaging, tweeting, or doing anything at all that he might disapprove of in the event that he would later use it against her to torture her and her family, as he had done so many times before. Dr. Luke used the suffocating control he had over Ms. Sebert to trap her into long-term contracts which were one-sided, extortive, and devastating to her health, sanity, and carer.MS. SEBERTS CURRENT LIFE-THREATENING STATE39. The continuous and ongoing years of sexually, physical, verbal, ad emotional abuse and harassment at the hands of Dr. Luke took their toll on Ms. Sebert, who was forced to seek emergency medical help. In January 2014, Ms. Sebert entered a rehabilitation treatment center in Illinois to save her life.\n40. Beyond the physical and emotional wounds, Dr. Lukes abuse had caused Ms. Sebert to suffer from bulimia nervosa, an eating disorder which causes a person to binge eat a large amount of food, only to later vomit the food or perform excessive exercise in an attempt to avoid gaining weight. Doctors at the facility told Ms. Sebert and her family that he blood pressure and sodium levels were similar to levels found in patients following a heart attack or stroke. Doctors found that Ms. Sebert suffered from psychological effects caused by Dr. Lukes abuse, including severe depression, post-traumatic stress, social isolation, and panic attacks. The psychological effects of the repeated abuse suffered were continuous and ongoing as Ms. Sebert was constantly reminded of the abuse by having to continue to be around Dr. Luke and his unrelenting emotional and psychological abuse.\n41. The doctors concluded that Dr. Luke had physically and psychologically damaged Ms. Sebert to the point where continuing such contact would be life threatening to Ms. Sebert. After spending over two months in the rehab center, Ms. Sebert was released to her family in March 2014.\n42. Ms. Sebert continues to be under Dr. Lukes physical and contractual control and remains obligated to collaborate with him despite the present, and clinically diagnosed, threat he poses to her life. Despite her recording success, she is unable to receive any meaningful profit form her work due to Dr. Lukes exploitation of her over the last decade. Ms. Sebert is terrified to even attempt to take control of her intellectual property and her recording career, due to years of working under Dr. Lukes physical and psychological abuse and threats. She is terrified that Dr. Luke will continue to exploit her physically and professionally.\n43. Dr. Luke used Kasz Money, Inc., Prescription Songs, LLC, Kemosabe Entertainment, LLC, and Kemosabe Records, LLC as vehicles for his continued torture and abuse of his recording artists, including Ms. Sebert. Defendants consciously took no action against Dr. Luke and instead, they acted to conceal Dr. Lukes conduct from those at Kasz Money, Inc., Prescription Songs, LLC, Kemosabe Entertainment LLC, and Kemosabe Records, LLC, as well as the public.

Defendants knew, or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that Dr. Luke was incompetent and unfit to perform the duties for which he was employed, and that undue risks to persons such as Ms. Sebert would result by way of Dr. Lukes abuse of the leadership privileges and authority hew was granted. Dr. Lukes conduct occurred in his capacity as head of Defendants Kasz Money, Inc. Prescription Songs, LLC, Kemosabe Entertainment, LLC, and Kemosabe Records, LLC, and was done for the benefit of these corporate defendants.\n114. Defendants were negligent by breaching the duty of care by retaining and failing to supervise Dr. Luke, who had known propensities for unlawful behavior including illegal drug use, violence, abuse, harassment, and misconduct towards females and recording artists that he worked with. Dr. Lukes conduct towards Plaintiff was foreseeable because Defendants were aware of his past misconduct towards Plaintiff, females, and other recording artists. Defendants breached their duty of care by failing to implement measures to protect third persons form foreseeable risks, unreasonable risks of harm, and the recurrence of employee behavior of which they had prior notice. Defendants failed to terminate Dr. Luke or take any disciplinary action against him; instead, they retained him and allowed him to continue victimizing Ms. Sebert.\n115. Defendants failure to train, supervise, and terminate Dr. Luke was the direct and proximate cause of Plaintiffs injuries. Plaintiff has suffered past and future special damages and past and future general damages in an amount according to proof at trial. Plaintiff has been damages physically, emotionally, and financially, including but not limited to suffering from pain, anxiety, depression, emotional distress, and ridicule, as well as loss of health, income, employment, and career benefits.PRAYERWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants as follows:\n1. For general and special damages in an amount to be determined at trial;\n2. For pre- and post-judgment interest according to proof;\n3. For injunctive and declaratory relief as to all causes of action, and specifically:\n to void Plaintiffs current recording agreements with Kasz Money, Inc. and Kemosabe Record, LLC, and her publishing agreement with Prescription Songs LLC, in order to prevent Defendants from further engaging in abuse, violence, harassment, and exploitation.\n to allow Plaintiff to freely entre into contracts with other recording and publishing companies without interference or harassment from Defendants.\n4. For punitive and exemplary damages;\n5. For costs of suit including reasonable attorneys fees and statutory fees, as allowed by law; and\n6. For all other relief as this court may deem just and proper.\nDATED: October 13, 2014\nGERAGOS & GERAGOS, APC\nBy:_______\nMARK J.

Im so excited to be here.\nRyan: I was reading some of the facts about your single Tik Tok. Youre breaking records with this. Did you know that?\nKe$ha: Ive heard rumors.\nRyan: Yeah. Right on top. Right up against that Susan Boyle.\nKe$ha: Oh yeah!\nRyan: Very, very opposite styles. Wouldnt you say?\nEllen K: Yes!\nKe$ha: I think were very similar.\nRyan: So you are from here?\nKe$ha: Well yeah, I was born in the valley, but then I grew up in Nashville.\nRyan: How did you end up in Nashville?\nKe$ha: That was -- My mom was kind of like a punk rocker, and as a joke she wrote a country song that ended up being recorded by Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, and Merle Haggard.\nRyan: Wow.\nKe$ha: Yeah.\nRyan: And how did you end up back in LA?\nKe$ha: And then when I was seventeen, I got a phone call from this dude, and he was like, Oh, I think Im your dad! And I was like, Ok!\nRyan: I think Im your dad?\nEllen K: I think Im your dad? He thought he was--\nKe$ha: Yeah, cause I dont know who my dad is. And my mom was like, Hm, possibility. And so...\nRyan: Did she have any recollection?\nKe$ha: Oh yeah! She was like, Yeah, definite possibility. But at the time she just wanted a baby.\nRyan: Your mother sound like shes kind of like that, Hey! Let me just write a song and move on. Ah! Im just gonna have a baby and see what happens. So it turns out the guy was your dad?\nKe$ha: No! Not my dad. The guy had a video game chair, like in 40-Year-Old Virgin. So I was like, Nope. Youre not my dad. So after I figured that out, it was about the same time I hooked up with Dr. Luke and Max Martin, and then just started recording like crazy.\nRyan: At what point were you living in the Hills and in this Trans Am I read about?\nKe$ha: Oh! No, I actually wasnt living in the Trans Am. I was livig in my grandpas Lincoln Town and Country car.\nEllen K: Oh, those big.\nKe$ha: Yeah, it was very roomy.\nRyan: Nice! Much more space.\nKe$ha: Its like a boat, actually. But that was for in between the period of time when I met this dude how was definitely not my dad, cause it was off the airplane, move in with this dude, Youre not my dad... Im gonna go..., and Im like, Where do I go? A car!\nRyan: Have you found your dad?\nKe$ha: No.\nEllen K: Do you want to?\nKe$ha: No!\nRyan: If youre her dad, 1-800-520-1027.\nEllen K: Now people are just going to say theyre your dad, again.\nKe$ha: I dont know.

You need to tell everybody why you said that.\nKe$ha: Ok. So, one morning I woke up feeling like a pimp, cause I was-- well, I woke up surrounded by a bunch of babes!\nRyan: A bunch of chicks?\nKe$ha: Yeah. So it was kind of like Babefest09. Cause I really dont like to sleep alone, but in a totally slumber-party kind of way.\nRyan: Right. So they crashed with you?\nKe$ha: So they crashed with me. Cause I was pretty sure my house was haunted.\nRyan: You were afraid.\nKe$ha: So I was terrified. So they crashed.\nRyan:\nKe$ha: Yes. Obviously.\nRyan: I wanna wake up in the morning and feel like Ke$ha! And are any of these your partners?\nKe$ha: No!\nRyan: Just all platonic?\nKe$ha: Just babe friends.\nRyan: Theres a track called Stephen. Was Stephen in there?\nKe$ha: No! Stephens a loser!\nRyan: Well, tell me about Stephen. Tell me about this song. Why is Stephen a loser?\nKe$ha: Well, he wont call me! So obviously there must be something wrong with him.\nRyan: Right! Why wouldnt he call you? I get it. So you wrote a song about how he wont call you and you dont get it.\nKe$ha: Right. You obsess about the one guy who will not call you. And he was that one for me for like five years. Well, seven.\nRyan: You were twelve.\nKe$ha: I used to just drive by his house and the whole crazy bit. Yeah, I kind of stalked him a little bit, actually.\nRyan: Did you find out why he never called you?\nKe$ha: Cause hes a loser.\nRyan: So this morning Ke$ha up early -- Ellen, could you describe in the best fashionista detail what Ke$has got on today?

She writes on herself...\nRyan: Yeah, thats what I was really interested in.\nEllen: A red bra -- she just showed me, red lace. And big old shades.\nRyan: But you have dollar signs written all over your forearm, and then also some lyrics or words or something on your body.\nKe$ha: My hotel -- the name of my hotel.\nRyan: You have short-term memory loss?\nKe$ha: Kind of.\nRyan: You know where you are?\nKe$ha: I think. Im on air with Ryan Seacrest.\nRyan: Why the dollar sign in your name, Ke$ha?\nKe$ha: Ok, that? Honestly, I was trying to be ironic. Because -- let me explain this to you. Its not cause Im like, Yeah, I got lots of money. Money! Woo! Its more like, I dont have any money. So... Im money. Cause I dont have any. This was at a point where I was on the track with Flo Rida, and I was hearing it everywhere, while Im shopping at the the dollar store for canned vegetables.\nRyan: It is ironic. You couldnt get away from this. And this is Ke$ha on here, the female voice here. But you couldnt get away from this song. However, you couldnt get fresh tomato. Explain this; I dont understand. And I think a lot of people might think, What youve made, youre on a hit record, at least you get paid something. How do you have nothing, yet youre ubiquitous?\nKe$ha: To be totally honest, I kind of walked into that situation accidentally. I walked into the studio and Flo Rida just thought I looked crazy. Lets put you on a record. And then he just kept it. And he liked it so much, I was actually on another song on his record called Touch Me, which a lot of people dont know. But anyways, he just tried to find other people to be the vocal, and nobody else cut it. So we kept mine. So I was just kind of like, You know what? Take it. Whatever.\nRyan: Did you also try to sneak into Princes house?\nKe$ha: Oh, I didnt try.\nRyan: You did?\n\nRyan: Lets talk about Prince. So you snuck into his place?\nKe$ha: It sounded so much less psychotic in my mind. When I got his address, I was just like, Oh! Obviously Ill just go to his house and give him my CD. No big deal. Ill just wrap a CD in a bow, and there we go. So I snuck under his fence, but then I got stuck.\nRyan: Youre talking about this big mansion up here?\nKe$ha: Yeah, yeah, yeah. In Hollywood -- hes moved since.\nRyan: I wonder why! It didnt sound so crazy in your head; I think in ours it sounds a little crazy.\nKe$ha: And my butt wouldnt Uh!\nRyan: Did he get the CD?\nKe$ha: Yeah! No, I snuck under, paid the gardener five bucks, went in the house, the door was unlocked, ended up in his practice space, and gave him the CD. I did-- I did have to let myself out, per the security. But, I didnt get arrested. Horray!\nRyan: Right. And look at you now.\nKe$ha: Look at me now.\nRyan: A five-year-old knows your song. Ryan plays Tik Tok\n\nRyan: Ke$ha is with us. Ben, go ahead, youre on Kiss FM.\nBen: Hey Kaysha, I saw that on the music video -- do you like guys like that? And is that Dirt Nasty?\nKe$ha: That is Dirt Nasty! Hes actually a friend of mine. We did some songs together. But I do like guys with preferrably a trashy mustache and/or mullet -- either-or.\nRyan: Can you give an example of a guys that looks like that?\nKe$ha: Like Joe Dirt. Did anybody see that movie? Hes like my fantasy. For real.\nRyan: So you do like dudes.\nKe$ha: Oh yes. I like dudes? Oh yeah, I like dudes!\nBen: You dont like clean-cut guys like Ryan and me?\nKe$ha: And you? Well, I cant see you, but I like all dudes. Really. But I prefer a mullet and/or beard and/or... I kind of like fat guys, and guys who cant see super well cause then they cant see other girls.\nBen: I gotta change what I eat.\nRyan: Ben, thanks for listening to us.

Diddy...\nP. DIDDY: Hey, what up, girl?\nMs. SEBERT: ...got my glasses, Im out the door. Im gonna hit this city. Before I leave, brush my teeth with a bottle of Jack, cause when I leave for the night I aint coming back.\nSCOTT SIMON, host:\nThe pop world has a new sensation.\nMs. SEBERT: Dont stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up, tonight, Im a fight, til we see the sunlight. Tick tock on the clock, but the party dont stop, no, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Dont stop...\nSIMON: Thats Ke$ha, with her hit song Tik Tok. Rolling Stone has called her music repulsive, obnoxious and ridiculously catchy.\nMs. SEBERT: The party dont start til I walk in.\nSIMON: Whatever it is, its number one on the charts - Ke$ha has replaced Susan Boyle. Tik Tok is taken from her debut album, Animal, that sold over 150,000 copies. Shes been called the first breakout star of 2010. Ke$ha Sebert joins us from our studios in New York. Thanks so much for being with us.\nMs. SEBERT: Thanks so much for having me.\nSIMON: First, how do you like a description like Rolling Stones? Let me read again - repulsive, obnoxious and ridiculously catchy.\nMs. SEBERT: I think its funny. I think that I have then captured myself pretty accurately because I can be obnoxious. I dont think Im necessarily repulsive, except for I havent showered in a few days. But ridiculously catchy? Im way into that part.\nSIMON: Well, I cant tell that you havent showered in a few days so...\nSIMON: You kind of grew up in the music business. The creative part, if you please, the behind-the-sheet-of-music part, as opposed to the performing part. What led you to the stage, finally?\nMs. SEBERT: One of my first memories was, I was kind of like, looking up at my mom as she was performing.\nSIMON: This is Pebe Sebert, your mother...\nMs. SEBERT: Um-hum. My mom.\nSIMON: ...who wrote Old Flames Cant Hold Candle to You.\nMs. SEBERT: Yeah, that was recorded by - I dont know if you know this; you probably do - but Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton and Merle Haggard. So shes just an incredible writer - and person. And when I would go to high school, Id come home and for fun, we would write songs together. So...\nSIMON: This is in Nashville?\nMs. SEBERT: Um-hmm.\nSIMON: Yeah.\nMs. SEBERT: And I always knew it was what I wanted to do. I never really thought about having a...\nMs. SEBERT: Im sorry.\nSIMON: Is that your cell phone?\nMs. SEBERT: I thought I turned it off. Let me turn it off.\nSIMON: How funny. There you are, a now-famous musician, thats your ringtone?\nMs. SEBERT: Yeah. I am such a space cadet...\nSIMON: I mean, people are probably downloading some of your songs as their ringtone and youve got that little, you know, otherworldly Martian bleep.\nMs. SEBERT: I want to get a beeper. Im sick of this technology.\nSIMON: I dont know if you can get them anymore.\nMs. SEBERT: No. I want to look into it cause then nobody can bother me; they can just page me. Call them back. But anyways, Im sorry about that. No. What I was just saying is music - Ive never really believed in having a fallback plan, so just kind of - I always knew this was what I was going to do.\nSIMON: Tell us about the song Stephen that was co-written by your mother.\nMs. SEBERT: I love that song.\nSIMON: Well, why dont we listen to a little of it.\nMs. SEBERT: All right. Yeah.\nMs. SEBERT: Stephen, why wont you call me? Stephen, why wont you call me? I saw you in your tight ass rocker pants. You saw me, too. I laughed, cause I was completely trashed. And I watched your ugly girlfriend sneer across the room, as if I really care that shes here with you...\nSIMON: This song winds up being unexpectedly touching. Ill tell our audience, OK, who are obviously going to notice a couple of other properties before they take my word that its touching. But it is.\nMs. SEBERT: Well, the song is really vulnerable. Its about a guy that I was completely obsessed with - and he would just not give me the time of day - and being so frustrated over it. The chorus is Stephen, why wont you call me? I cant take rejection. Why wont you call me?\nMs. SEBERT: Stephen, why wont you call me? Im sitting here waiting. Why wont you call me? Stephen, Im feeling pathetic. I cant take rejection. Why wont you call me?\nSIMON: Is his name actually Stephen?\nMs. SEBERT: Oh, yes.\nSIMON: Ooh, my word.\nMs. SEBERT: I really think its the best revenge.\nSIMON: Boy, a best-selling album. So we can hope that Stephen is like, stacking the toilet tissue at Wal-Mart now, right?\nMs. SEBERT: Well, I mean, hes such a loser.\nSIMON: Which is an honest job, dont get me wrong. And respectable, but yeah.\nMs. SEBERT: No. Hes just such a loser. Like, looking back on my obsession, its kind of like just so silly. Its just, he wouldnt call.\nSIMON: Because this records doing so well, do you have an investment, even at the age of 22, at continuing to do teenage music?\nMs. SEBERT: I think that with this record, I just want to make people happy. I realize that Im getting a lot of slack because Im a chick, and I brush my teeth with Jack. And thats so shocking but...\nSIMON: You mean Jack Daniels?\nMs. SEBERT: That would be the one.\nSIMON: Yeah. I just thought Id ask. Okay. Were non-commercial here but if I may, Crest might be more effective.\nMs. SEBERT: I dont think its as, like...\nSIMON: Im not sure Jack...\nMs. SEBERT: ...as anti-bacterial.\nSIMON: ...Im not sure Jack cuts down on tartar, if you get my drift.\nMs. SEBERT: I dont know about that, but I think it is an anti-bacterial, right?\nSIMON: You know, I guess it is.\nMs. SEBERT: There you go.\nSIMON: Right.\nMs. SEBERT: Better than nothing.\nSIMON: Well, you know, a lot of people listening to us now just might be on the verge of brushing their teeth so, you know...\nMs. SEBERT: Make the right choice.\nSIMON: Yeah. Turn away from the medicine cabinet and go into the pantry. See if you can find a - well, I guess I have to say Im kidding. In any event, let me just add that for the record.\nOh, talking about living like an animal, lets listen to Backstabber, if we could.\nMs. SEBERT: Bored, stoned, sitting in your basement, all alone, cause your little conversations got around, and look at what we all found out. Look at what we found. Lookie here, we all found out that you have got a set of loose lips, twisting stories all because youre jealous. Now I know exactly what youre all about. And this is what youre all about. Girl, youre such a backstabber...\nSIMON: This is an angry song.\nMs. SEBERT: Well, its not angry. Its more about chicks need to watch each others backs. I feel like I treat my friends with so much respect, and theyre like family. And when Im wronged by somebody that is like, part of my family, its rough. So I had to write a song about it.\nMs. SEBERT: Im sick and tired of hearing all of my life from other people with all of your lies, wrapped up so tight, so maybe you should shut your mouth, shut your mouth, you never shut your mouth...\nSIMON: Im told you had just about perfect SAT scores.\nMs. SEBERT: It was close - 1,500. I was like, very studious. I was actually in the international baccalaureate program, in AP; I, like, loved physics and math, and I was in the marching band. And then after that practice, I would drive to Belmont - its a college in Nashville - and just for fun, listen in on Cold War history classes, just cause - I just think its so interesting.\nAnd I was so curious kind of about all of that, I ended up taking my first solo trip to Cuba. So point being: I was very studious and really curious about a lot of things that are much deeper than, you know, partying and dancing.\nSIMON: Youve described this album, I gather, as celebrating - Im going to read this now - boys, boots, beer, boobs.\nMs. SEBERT: It is a celebration. I think the whole records kind of a celebration of fun and youth and life. I wrote every song on the record, and Ive also written for other people as well. And so Im really proud of this record. I wrote maybe over 200 songs.\nSIMON: Were going to get some email saying: I dont listen to NPR to hear that kind of music.\nI like you, and I like your music.\nMs. SEBERT: Thanks, and I like that. Because you know what? I just stand for fun. Its pop music; its not rocket science. Its not brain surgery. And Im going to stand by the fact that Im proud of this record, and Im not a moron. So there.\nMs. SEBERT: I am in love with what we are, not what we should be...\nSIMON: Ke$ha, awfully nice talking to you.\nMs. SEBERT: Deal. Nice to talk to you, man. Thank you so much.\nSIMON: Our pleasure. Ke$ha in New York. Her debut album, Animal, out now and selling - well, like an animal.\nMs. SEBERT: Thanks.\nMs. SEBERT: So if its just tonight, the animal inside, let it live and die.

I was like, Man, they dont know Im in on the joke! But then I saw Eastbound & Down, and I knew Kenny Powers would totally get me. Were both oblivious, missing social cues about whats appropriate. We both have a really dark and obscene sense of humor, which my publicists tell me I have to tone down. But Kenny doesnt tone it down. He owns that shit. I am proud to be his female embodiment.\nI really dont have a proper gauge on entertainment in society these days. I literally only watch Eastbound & Down and The Golden Girls. Kenny is mostly a mix between Blanche and Sophia. But we all have a little Rose in us, too. The beauty is in the combination, which is what Kenny has.\nI always wanted to guest on Eastbound – just be some trashy girl on the Jet Ski with my shirt off. Ill miss Kenny. I love that man.
