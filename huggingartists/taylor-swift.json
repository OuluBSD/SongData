to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we dont know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.\nThis is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.\nThe point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. Ive been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, Ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing.\nWhen this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because its 2017 and if you didnt see a picture of it, it couldnt have happened right?\nLet me say it again, louder for those in the back...\nWe think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.\nThere will be no further explanation.\nThere will be just reputation.",

Bro. Listen to the kids. Jeremy, I need, I gotta put it down for a second. It’s beautiful. Jeremy Scotts design.\nFirst of all, thank you Taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award, this evening thank you. And I can think back to the first day I met you, also. You know. I think about, when I’m in the grocery store with my daughter, and I have a really great conversation about fresh juice and, you know. And at the end they say, Oh, you’re not that bad after all. And like, I think about it sometimes. Like, it crosses my mind a bit like when I go to a baseball game. And um, sixty thousand people boo me. Crosses my mind a little bit. And I think if I had to do it all again what would I have done?\nWould I have worn a leather shirt? Would I have drank a half a bottle of Hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience Y’all know y’all drink that bottle too. If I had a daughter at that time, would I have went on stage and grab the mic from someone elses? You know, this arena tomorrow, it’s gonna be a completely different set up, some concert something like that. This stage will be gone, after that night, the stage is gone, but the effect that it had on people remain.\nThe, the problem was, the contradiction, the contradiction is, I do fight for artists, but in that fight I somehow, was disrespectful to artists. I-I didn’t know how to say the right thing. The perfect thing. I just, I sat at the Grammy’s and saw Justin Timberlake and Cee-Lo lose. Gnarls Barkley and the Future-Love... SexyBack album, and bro….Justin I ain’t tryna put you on blast but I saw that man in tears, bro. You know, and I was thinking like, He deserve to win Album of the Year.\nAnd this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening. How could you explain that? Sometimes I feel like, you know, all this shit they run about beef and that, sometimes I feel like I died for an artists opinion, for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful. I’m not no politician bro. And look at that, you know how many times MTV ran that footage again, cause it got them more ratings? You know how many times they announced Taylor was gonna give me the award, cause it got them more ratings? Listen to the kids bro!\nI still don’t understand award shows, I don’t understand how they get five people who work their entire life, won, sold records, sold concert tickets, to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser. I don’t understand it bro. I don’t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video, I still don’t understand it, I been conflicted bro, I just wanted people to like me more. But fuck that bro!\nTwo thousand and fifteen. I will die for the art for what I believe in and the art aint always gonna be polite. Y’all might be thinking right now, I wonder, did he smoke something before he came up here? The answer is yes, I rolled up a little something, I knocked the edge off. I don’t know what’s gonna happen tonight, I don’t know whats going to happen tomorrow bro.\nBut all I can say to my artists, my fellow artists, just worry how you feel at the time man, just worry about how you feel and don’t never, you know what I’m saying, I’m confident, I believe in myself. We the millennials bro, this is a new, this is a new mentality. We not gonna control our kids with brands. We’re not gonna teach low self-esteem and hate to our kids, we’re gonna teach our kids that they can be something. We gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves. We gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves. If my grandfather was here right now, he would not let me back down.\nI don’t know what I’m finna lose after this. It don’t matter though, it ain’t about me, it’s about ideas. People with new ideas. People who believe in truth.\nAnd yes, as you probably could have guessed by this moment, I have decided in 2020, to run for President.", "Theres something bout the way\nThe street looks when its just rained\nTheres a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car\nAnd you know I wanna ask you to dance right there\nIn the middle of the parking lot, yeah\nOh, yeah\nWere driving down the road, I wonder if you know\nIm trying so hard not to get caught up now\nBut youre just so cool, run your hands through your hair\nAbsent-mindedly making me want you\nAnd I dont know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first, fearless\nAnd I dont know why but with you Id dance\nIn a storm in my best dress, fеarless\nSo, baby, drive slow til we run out of road in this onе-horse town\nI wanna stay right here, in this passengers seat\nYou put your eyes on me\nIn this moment now, capture it, remember it\nCause I dont know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first, fearless\nAnd I dont know why but with you Id dance\nIn a storm in my best dress, fearless\nOh, oh\nWell, you stood there with me in the doorway\nMy hands shake, Im not usually this way but\nYou pull me in and Im a little more brave\nIts the first kiss, its flawless, really something\nIts fearless\nOh, yeah\nCause I dont know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first, fearless\nAnd I dont know why but with you Id dance\nIn a storm in my best dress, fearless\nCause I dont know how it gets better than this\nYou take my hand and drag me head first, fearless\nAnd I dont know why but with you Id dance\nIn a storm in my best dress, fearless\nOh, oh\nOh-oh, yeah", "Tall, dark, and superman\nHe puts papers in his briefcase and drives away\nTo save the world or go to work\nIts the same thing to me\nHes got his mothers eyes, his fathers ambition\nI wonder if he knows how much that I miss him\nI hang on every word you say, yay\nAnd you smile and say, How are you?”\nI say, Just fine\nI always forget to tell you, I love you\nI love you forever\nI watch superman fly away\nYouve got a busy day today\nGo save the world, Ill be around\nI watch superman fly away\nCome back, Ill be with you someday\nIll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\nTall, dark and beautiful\nHes complicated, hes irrational\nBut I hope someday youll take me away and save the day, yeah\nSomething in his deep brown eyes has me sayin\nHes not all bad like his reputation\nAnd I cant hear one single word they say\nAnd youll leave, got places to be and Ill be okay\nI always forget to tell you I love you\nI loved you from the very first day\nI watch superman fly away\nYouve got a busy day today\nGo save the world, Ill be around\nI watch superman fly away\nCome back, Ill be with you someday\nIll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\nAnd I watch you fly around the world\nAnd I hope you dont save some other girl\nDont forget, dont forget about me\nIm far away, but I never let you go\nIm love-struck and looking out the window\nDont forget, dont forget where Ill be\nRight here, wishing the flowers were from you\nWishing the card was from you\nWishing the call was from you\nCause I loved you from the very first day\nI watch superman fly away\nYouve got a busy day today\nGo save the world, Ill be around\nForever and ever here\nI watch superman fly away\nI swear, Ill be with you someday\nIll be right here on the ground\nWhen you come back down\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nLa, la, la, la, la, la\nWhen you come back down", "So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end. How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and thats why Im still so in love with song writing. So what Ive done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways. So Ill explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together\nI sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because Id always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time. So I always wanna be prepared. I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said I cant stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else. So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called I Know Places. So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song\nOkay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:\nUh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i\nOh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i\nNa na na na waiting at the back door\nTheyre around and the vultures come around\nAnd you know that they wont, they wont us\nSay what they want bout, say what they want bout us\nAnd you come and sing and listen\nI would not think about it but Im not done\nEvery know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I\nCause they got the cages, they got the boxes\nAnd guns\nThey are the hunters we are the foxes\nAnd we run\nBaby, I know some places we wont be found\nAnd theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down\nCause I, I know places we can hide\nI know places, I know places\nUh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places\nOr whatever. I dont know, but thats basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and its about, like, everybodys, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and its like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus. So I hope you like it, it wouldnt be a piano thing. It would be, like, . Like, very, like, beat. Now Im just making weird sounds. Hope you like it!", "Friday night beneath the stars\nIn a field behind your yard\nYou and I are painting pictures in the sky\nAnd sometimes we dont say a thing\nJust listen to the crickets sing\nEverything I need is right here by my side\nAnd I know everything about you\nI dont wanna live without you\nIm only up when youre not down\nDont wanna fly if youre still on the ground\nIts like no matter what I do\nWell, you drive me crazy half the time\nThe other half, Im only tryna\nLet you know that what I feel is true\nAnd Im only me when Im with you\nJust a small-town boy and girl\nLiving in a crazy world\nTryna figure out what is and isnt true\nAnd I dont try to hide my tears\nMy secrets or my deepest fears\nThrough it all nobody gets me like you do\nAnd you know everything about me\nYou say that you cant live without me\nIm only up when youre not down\nDont wanna fly if youre still on the ground\nIts like no matter what I do\nWell, you drive me crazy half the time\nThe other half, Im only tryna\nLet you know that what I feel is true\nAnd Im only me when Im with you\nWhen Im with anybody else\nIts so hard to be myself\nAnd only you can tell\nThat Im only up when youre not down\nDont wanna fly if youre still on the ground\nIts like no matter what I do\nWell, you drive me crazy half the time\nThe other half, Im only tryna\nLet you know that what I feel is true\nAnd Im only me, who I wanna be\nWell, Im only me when Im with you\nWith you\nUh-huh, yeah", "Coreys eyes are like a jungle\nHe smiles, its like the radio\nHe whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows\nThese pretty girls on every corner\nThey watch him as hes walking home, saying, Does he know?\nWill you ever know?\nYoure beautiful\nEvery little piece, love\nAnd dont you know\nYoure really gonna be someone\nAsk anyone\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\nI hope your life will lead you back to my door\nOh, but if it dont\nStay beautiful\nCorey finds another way to be the highlight of my day\nIm taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day\nIts hard to make a conversation when hes taking my breath away\nI should say\nHey, by the way\nYoure beautiful\nEvery little piece, love\nAnd dont you know\nYoure really gonna be someone\nAsk anyone\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\nI hope your life will lead you back to my door\nOh, but if it dont\nStay beautiful\nIf you and I are a story\nThat never gets told\nIf what you are is a daydream\nIll never get to hold\nAt least youll know\nYoure beautiful\nEvery little piece, love\nAnd dont you know\nYoure really gonna be someone\nAsk anyone\nAnd when you find everything you looked for\nI hope your life will lead you back to my front door\nOh, but if it dont\nWill you stay\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful?\nBeautiful, beautiful, beautiful?\nLa la la\nOh, oh, oh, oh\nOh, but if it dont\nStay beautiful\nStay beautiful\nNa, na, na, na, na", "So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin and Johan Shellback and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything were doing when were putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we want to go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying. Um, so I brought in this idea called Blank Space, and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and theyre shouting out these production ideas like, you know the Oh! at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song. So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called Blank Space.\nNice to meet you, where you been?\nI could show you incredible things\nDiamonds, seasides, all those things\n this song that \nLike, oh my God, listen in\nListen in, I do too\n honest \nWe can all sing this and cry\n thinking, all this time\nOh my God, listening\nJust forget what youve heard about me\nDont believe what you hear about me, hear about me\nCause its gonna be forever, or gonna go -\nYeah! Hey, hey!\nGonna go down in flames\nYou can tell me when its over -\nThis is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track\nLong list of ex-love -\nGot a long list of ex-lovers, theyll tell you Im insane\nBut Ive got a blank space, baby\nClick Ill write your name\nIve got a blank space, baby\nClick Ill write your name\nThats awesome! I love it\nOh my god, everyones gonna kill you\nYeah!", "PrologueThese songs were once about my life. They are now about yours.\nI was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989.\nIn the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately Ive been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn...\nThe debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I dont make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isnt it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?\nFor the last few years, Ive woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than Id ever told you before.\nI wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no riding off into the sunset, like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they cant make me lose my mind. Ive learned how to shake things off.\nIve told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive.\nI hope you know that youve given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back dont define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for.\nFrom the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...\nLove, Taylor1.

It says love is so short, forgetting is so long. Its a line Ive related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when were trying to move on the moments we always go back to arent the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that werent really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened, and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope, extreme joy, intense passion, wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown. And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red.\nMy experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And theres something to be learned from waiting all day for a train thats never coming. And theres something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and doesnt fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of.

Its a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyones heart race, and a moment Ive always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what theyd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.\nReal life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what Ive begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.\nI think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didnt speak up. When we didnt say I love you. When we shouldve said Im sorry. When we didnt stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.\nThese songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.\nWords can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.\nWhat you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.\nSo say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’\nThere is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it.\nI dont think you should wait. I think you should speak now.\nLove, Taylor\nPS: To all the boys who inspired this album, you shouldve known. ;)1. Mine\nHidden message: Toby\n2. Sparks Fly\nHidden message: Portland, Oregon\n3.

This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff, and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes I made this amazing track the other day. Its so cool, I love these guitar sounds. And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me. And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called I Wish You Would, because Jack wrote back and said I love that. So this is another way of writing, its writing to track:\nOkay so this is an idea called I Wish You Would. Its kind of about this guy whos like, hes driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriends house and its like, he thinks she hate him, but shes still in love with him, very dramatic.

still dont know what I never said\nI wish you would come back\nWish I never hung up the phone like I did\nI wish you knew that\nId never forget you as long as I live, and I\nWish you were right here,

"Taylors Letter\nThis album is called Fearless, and I guess Id like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, Fearless is not the absence of fear. Its not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though youve been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time youe tried before, youve lost. Its fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you cant breathe without them. I think its fearless to fall for your best friend, even though hes in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things theyll never stop doing, I think its fearless to stop believing them. Its fearless to say youre NOT sorry, and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...Thats fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. Thats why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless\n1.

You still got the Nashville number?\nTaylor: I still have the Nashville area code but I had to change it\nKanye: For all my south side niggas that know me best, I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex.\nTaylor: Im, like, this close to overexposure.\nKanye: Oh well this one is, uh — I think this is a really cool thing to have.\nTaylor: I know! I mean its like a compliment kind of.\nKanye: What I give a fuck about is just you as a person, and as a friend.\nTaylor: Thats sweet.\nKanye: I want things that make you feel good. I dont wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.\nTaylor: Um, yea. I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. Its obviously very tongue in cheek either way.\nTaylor: And I really appreciate you telling me about it, thats really nice!\nKanye: Yea. I just felt I had a responsibility to you as a friend. I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.\nTaylor: Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it. Like, the heads up is so nice!\nTaylor: …things without like even asking or seeing if Id be OK with it. And I just really appreciate it.\nTaylor: Id never expect you to tell me about a line in your song.\nTaylor: And then the flowers that you sent me, I Instagrammed a picture of them and its the most Instagram likes Ive ever gotten.\nKanye: Relationships are more important than punchlines, you know.\nTaylor: Yea. I mean, I dont think anybody would listen to that and be like, Oh, thats a real diss. Like, she must be crying about…\nTaylor: You gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it. Like you honestly didnt know who I was before that.\nTaylor: It doesnt matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didnt know who I was before that.\nTaylor: … that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. And, like, Im always gonna respect you.\nTaylor: And Im really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend, about the song. Its just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you.\nKanye: Thank you too.\nTaylor: And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, jokes on you guys, were fine.\nTaylor: You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out Im gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and theyre gonna ask me about it and Im gonna be like, he called me.\nTaylor: …awesome that youre so outspoken and its gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous! Its more provocative to say, Might still have sex.\nTaylor: …its not. It doesnt matter to me. theres not one\nthat hurts my feelings and one that doesnt.2020 LeakKanye: —old school s—, yeah. I’m doing great. I feel so awesome about the music. The album’s coming out Feb. 11. I’m doing the fashion show Feb. 11 at Madison Square Garden and dropping the album Feb. 12, that morning. It’s like …. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Aw thank you so, so much. Thank you. It feels like, real. I don’t know, just ‘Ye, Apple, Steve Jobs-type music. Like, so my next single, I wanted you to tweet it … so that’s why I’m calling you. I wanted you to put the song out.\nTaylor: What would people … I guess it would just be, people would be like, “Why is this happening?” And I had something to do with it, probably.\nKanye: The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.\nTaylor: What does it say? \nKanye: It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I’ve thought about this line for eight months, I’ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it’s the most controversial, so it’s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?\nTaylor: Yeah…\nKanye: Okay, alright. It says—wait a second, you sound sad.\nTaylor: Well, is it gonna be mean?\nKanye: No, I don’t think it’s mean.\nTaylor: Okay, then let me hear it.\nKanye: Okay, um … and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like “Huh? What? That’s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.” And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, “Oh God, this is the craziest sh—! This is why I love Kanye,” that kind of thing. It’s like my wife’s favorite f—ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?\nTaylor: Okay.\nKanye: So it says, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.” \nTaylor: That’s not mean.\nKanye: Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I’m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it’s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, ‘Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that’s why I think it’s super genius to have you be the one that says, ‘Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it’s like, I got like s— on my album where I’m like, “I bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain’t love the same bitch.”\nTaylor: Oh my . I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I’m glad it’s not mean though. It doesn’t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. I thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it’s not. Um, so I don’t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I’m asked about, of course I’m gonna be like, “Yeah, I’m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it’s hilarious,” but um, I’ll think about it.\nKanye: Yeah, you don’t have to do—you don’t have to do the launch and retweet. That’s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that’s cool, then that’s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.\nTaylor: You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they’re gonna be like, “Wow,” like this thing—like they’ll just turn it into something that … I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it’ll be less cool ‘cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, ‘cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it’s like almost … I dont know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?\nKanye: Yeah.\nTaylor: I try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I’m like this close to overexposure.\nKanye: Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.\nTaylor: I know, it’s like a compliment, kind of .\nKanye: I had this line where I said—and my wife really didn’t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and my wife was really not with that one. She was way more into “She owes you sex,” but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s— that I was like, “Ahhh.”\nTaylor: That’s the part that I’m kind of—I mean, they’re both really edgy, but that’s the only thing about that line is that it’s like gonna … Its just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don’t give a fuck, so…\nKanye: Yeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make—\nTaylor: That’s sweet.\nKanye: —you feel good. I don’t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I’m mad at Nike, so people think like, “Oh, he’s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor. He’s bullying Nike now, this $50 billion company.”\nTaylor: Why are people saying you’re bullying Nike?\nKanye: Because on “Facts” I said like, “Yeezy, Nike out here bad, they can’t give shit away.”\nTaylor: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that’s just what you do though.\nKanye: \nTaylor: I mean, I wouldn’t say that it’s like possible to bully a company like Nike where—I mean, um, yeah, I mean …", "When I found old diaries from my childhood and my teens, they were covered in dust. Im not just saying that for poetic effect, they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes I used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments. Id practice my autograph and tape my guitar picks to the pages. In the entries, I daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous I was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game. I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence and trust. I vented, described memories in detail, jotted down new song ideas and questioned why I would ever try to shoot for a career I had such a small chance of ever attaining.\nBut what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies of the soccer field on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldn’t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were.\nIn life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love.\nIve decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things Im afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but theyre not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clergies voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... didnt. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, its someone who deserves you. If thats the case, I hope you treat them with care.\nThis album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it \nIn honor of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands, false gods and blind faith, memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool, creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light, finally finding a friend, and opening the curtains to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night.\nWe are what we love.\nThis is Lover.", "So first of all, Im obsessed with, like, pretty much all of these tracks, and it was really hard to figure out like what I wanted to write first because I had thoughts for all of them, so, unbelievable archives, I cant believe you have this just, like, laying around, thats ... ridiculous, these are unbelievable. But anyway, the first one that I... I was working something up for is the Maple one?

Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. \nAnd to kiss in cars and downtown bars\nWas all we needed\nYou drew stars around my scars\nNow Im bleedin\nIm bleedin\nWell work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, theres all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait til then, and then, I start singing again. I dont think its right now, but... there it is. The ending. \nCause I knew you\nSteppin on the last train\nMarked me like a bloodstain, I\nI knew you\nTried to change the ending\nPeter leaving Wendy, I\nI knew you\nDancing in your Levis\nDrunk under a streetlight, I\nI knew you\nThat when you are young, they assume you know nothing\nBut I knew youd linger like a stolen kiss\nI knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs\nThe smell of smoke would hang around this long\nCause I knew everything when I was young\nI knew Id curse you for the longest time\nI knew Id wish you wouldve changed your mind\nI knew youd miss me once the moment died\nI knew to love would be to lose my mind\nAnd then, I dont know.

Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity\nStars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate\nPretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people Ive never met, people Ive known, or those I wish I hadnt. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out\nA tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold\nIn isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. Ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve\nNow its up to you to pass them down", "", "I’m getting older and less sure of what you like about me anyway\nHow can a person know everything at 18 and nothing at 22?\nAnd will you still want me when I’m nothing new?", "Cold Open \nThe Betrayal \nSmashed Car \nWelvin Da Great at the Office\nLucky Fiori, Also at the Office \nFuturistic Tanning Bed \nArmor Prep \nBursting through Walls \nA Scene from the Movie Tron \nWelvin in a Plastic Car \nTarget Practice\nCrimson Curse Cackle \nInclement Weather Training\nBoxing \nRoman Candle\nCatastrophes Crew \nDestructa X finally shootsFinal Face OffPosters and CharactersCara Delevingne starring as Mother Chucker\nCindy Crawford starring as Headmistress\nEllen Pompeo starring as Luna\nEllie Goulding starring as Destructa X\nGigi Hadid starring as Slay-Z\nHailee Steinfeld starring as the Trinity\nHayley Williams starring as the Crimson Curse\nJessica Alba starring as Domino\nKarlie Kloss starring as Knockout\nKendrick Lamar starring as Welvin da Great\nLena Dunham starring as Lucky Fiori\nLily Aldridge starring as Frostbyte\nMariska Hargitay starring as Justice\nMartha Hunt starring as HomeSlice\nSelena Gomez starring as Arsyn\nSerayah McNeill starring as Dilemma\nTaylor Swift starring as Catastrophe\nZendaya starring as Cut-ThroatCatastrophe Vs.

Its weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. Ive heard people say that your thirties are the most fun! So Ill definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought Id share some lessons Ive learned before reaching 30, because its 2019 and sharing is caring.\nLesson 1\nI learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren’t, how you’re failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I’m showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I’m training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I’m also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to “go die in a hole ho” while I’m having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it’s healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once.\nLesson 2\nBeing sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life’s worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you. Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you.\nLesson 3\nTrying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal. It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture . BUT THAT SAID, it’s good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It’s especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That’s GOOD. We’ll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That’s not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you’ll learn from it. Then you’ll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it’s fine; do you, you’re searching.\nLesson 4\nI learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy. I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day.\nLesson 5\nBanish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn’t cruel. It’s just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it.\nLesson 6\nI’ve learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren’t allowed to age. It’s an impossible standard to meet, and I’ve been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we’re supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn’t even remotely required of men.\nLesson 7\nMy biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn’t know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe. My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I’ve ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I’ve witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.\nLesson 8\nI learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was “couples goals” based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn’t real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want.\nLesson 9\nI learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm’s cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016.\nLesson 10\nI’ve always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I’ll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten’s Real Meatballs and Spaghetti , Nigella Lawson’s Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver’s Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce. Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. \nLesson 11\nRecently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I’d hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape.\nLesson 12\nApologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it’s so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say “I’m sorry, but...” and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.\nLesson 13\nIt’s my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim. Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying “This happened to me.” It’s something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don’t.\nLesson 14\nWhen tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you’ve never dealt with before, it’s okay to say that you don’t know what to say. Sometimes just saying you’re so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It’s okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don’t have all the answers. However, it’s not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they’re at their lowest point. Even if you can’t really help the situation, it’s nice for them to know that you would if you could.\nLesson 15\nVitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy.\nLesson 16\nBefore you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don’t know...get to know someone! All that glitters isn’t gold, and first impressions actually aren’t everything. It’s impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them , but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them? Do they still love you after they’ve seen you broken? Or after they’ve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they’re people? These are things a first impression could never convey.\nLesson 17\nAfter my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner , I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin. I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can’t I be soft during all the seasons?!\nLesson 18\nRealizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone. It’s important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.\nLesson 19\nPlaying mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you’re shooting yourself in the foot if you don’t tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess.\nLesson 20\nLearning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about “we’re in our young twenties!” hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family. And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they’ll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It’s sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you’ll always keep the memories.\nLesson 21\nFashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don’t look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you’re doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.\nLesson 22\nHow to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you’re not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren’t trying to hurt you. If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there’s a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who “won” the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say “Hey, same team.” Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don’t give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers.\nLesson 23\nI learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don’t care if I’m #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they’re here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I’ll never forget the ones who stuck around.\nLesson 24\nI’ve had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It’s taught me that there are real problems and then there’s everything else. My mom’s cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.\nLesson 25\nI remember people asking me, “What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?” There’s a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I’m really grateful to have learned this isn’t true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.\nLesson 26\nI make countdowns for things I’m excited about. When I’ve gone through dark, low times, I’ve always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app and adding things I’m looking forward to. Even if they’re not big holidays or anything, it’s good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it’s good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things.\nLesson 27\nI learned that disarming someone’s petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I’ve come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously. A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I’ve ever felt in my life, but I can’t tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans. It’s the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll’s hateful Instagram comment with “lol.” It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I’ll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it.\nLesson 28\nI’m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I’m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.\nLesson 29\nI learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It’s the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they’ve left me. Please pray for their safe return.\nLesson 30\nMy mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I’d lock myself in my room and couldn’t forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I’ve made a mistake, whether it’s self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I’ve come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone.

we just couldnt stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in and my collaborators and I are proud to announce that my 9th studio album and folklores sister record is here. Its called evermore.\nIve never done this before. In the past Ive always treated albums as one-off еras and moved onto planning the next onе as soon as an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found. So I just kept writing them. And I loved creating these songs with Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, WB, and Justin Vernon. Weve also welcomed some new friends to our musical kitchen table this time around...\nBefore I knew it there were 17 tales, some of which are mirrored or intersecting with one another. The one about two young con artists who fall in love while hanging out at fancy resorts trying to score rich romantic beneficiaries. The one where longtime college sweethearts had very different plans for the same night, one to end it and one who brought a ring. Dorothea, the girl who left her small town to chase down Hollywood dreams - and what happens when she comes back for the holidays and rediscovers an old flame. The unhappily ever after anthology of marriages gone bad that includes infidelity, ambivalent toleration, and even murder. The most righteous motive, to avenge the fallen. The realization that maybe the only path to healing is to wish happiness on the one who took it away from you. One starring my grandmother, Marjorie, who still visits me sometimes...if only in my dreams.\nI wanted to surprise you with this the week of my 31st birthday. Youve all been so caring, supportive and thoughtful on my birthdays and so this time I wanted to give you something! I also know this holiday season will be a lonely one for most of us and of there are any of you out there who turn to music to cope with missing loved ones the way I do, this is for you.\nI have no idea what will come next. I have no idea about a lot of things these days and so Ive clung to the one thing that keeps me connected to you all. That thing always has and always will be music.\nAnd may it continue, evermore.", "A heart is drawn around your name\nIn someones handwriting, not mine", "I walk in the room theres a beautiful

that youre reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…its just coming alive\nThere are many people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace. Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently\nIn recent years, youve probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it\nMusic is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. Its my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an albums price point is. I hope they dont underestimate themselves or undervalue their art\nArrows Through the Heart\nIn mentioning album sales, Id like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now theyre buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really arent alone in feeling so alone. It isnt as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us\nThere are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in peoples lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling . Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past\nHowever, some artists will be like finding the one. We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon\nI think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say shock; I said surprise. I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why cant this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?\nIn the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generations artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be\nThere are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I havent been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento kids these days want is a selfie. Its part of the new currency, which seems to be how many followers you have on Instagram.\nFan Power\nA friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around\nAnother theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, thats incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool\nThis moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all\nCelebrity Spotlight\nI predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones. Artists who were at their commercial peak in the 70s, 80s and 90s tell me, It was never this crazy for us back then! And I suspect Ill be saying that same thing to younger artists someday . There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to\nAnd as for me? Ill just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism\nAnd Id also like a nice garden", "Here we go

you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind\nHead on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin in\nAs if you were a mythical thing\nLike you were a trophy or a champion ring\nAnd there was one prize Id cheat to win\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nLife was a willow, and it bent right to your wind\nThey count me out time and time again\nLife was a willow, and it bent right to your wind\nBut I come back stronger than a 90s trend\nWait for the signal, and Ill meet you after dark\nShow me the places where the others gave you scars\nNow this is an open-shut case\nI guess I shouldve known from the look on your face\nEvery bait-and-switch was a work of art\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nYou know that my train could

But I was happy that it wasnt, like, there werent too sketchy things. Those were really good things that stand up. Rain Man is still great to watch, Faith is still a fantastic album.\nLike a Prayer by Madonna came out in 1989, one of the most influential pop songs and music videos of all time.\nYou were born.\nI was in 1989 for two weeks.\nYeah, thats okay. Thats okay.\nBut it still happened in that year.\nIt happened in 1989. Youve only released a studio album four times previous to this, so this is something that doesnt happen to you all that often. So, the title of it -\nIts really important.\nThe theme of it is really important, right? When was the moment you decided it was gonna be 1989?\nActually, no one... this is why I like talking to you, because no one has ever come at it from this angle and actually asked me that specific question. Its actually a really interesting moment. I remember exactly when I decided that I was gonna call it 1989. It was the night of the Grammys this year. After the Grammys I didnt go to any afterparties or anything, I kind of wanted to go home and eat In-N-Out Burger with my friends. I remember going home and playing a lot of the new music I had recorded for some of my backup singers and one of my best friends. We were all sitting in the kitchen and I was playing them all this music, and they were just saying, ‘you know, this is very eighties. It’s very clear to us that this is so eighties.’ We were just talking and talking about how it’s kind of a rebirth in a new genre, how that’s a big bold step, how, kind of, starting a part of your career over. When they left that night, I just had this very clear moment of, ‘it’s gotta be called 1989. Its gotta be called that. Were talking about creative rebirth, my birth year, the album is eighties-influenced. I didnt know I was doing that but I was doing that.\nYou didnt know you were doing that?\nI didnt mean to do it, I just was doing it. And so, then, after that, I really was able to focus on the, kind of, eighties sonic concept. And then it really came together as a very sonically cohesive project.\nWere you still writing songs in the traditional way, with a guitar?\nYes and no, I mean, some of them I wrote on piano, some of them I wrote on guitar. Some of them I would think of some synth line in my head and sing it into my phone and send it to my co-writers and say, ‘do you think this would sound cool?’\nLike, without words, just singing the, kind of, synth line?\nYeah! Or singing a drum beat over top of it, and I would send it to them and Id go, ‘I don’t have the right keyboard to make this sound in my house. I just have a piano and a guitar, but let me play it for you on piano and let you know what I think the bassline should be, and we can start there.’ Or it would be a first line of a first verse, or it would be, sort of, an image that I wanted to create a feeling around. We would just start with this image I had, or a story. It was a lot different than making any of my other albums.\nIt was?\nYeah.\nBiggest difference was what?\nThe biggest difference was that I didnt have any, I didnt have any boundaries around me production-wise. You know, one of my favorite things about country music is that it taught me how to tell stories. Coming up in the Nashville songwriting community was the greatest thing that couldve ever happened to me because it taught me how to weave a story together with very, um, very detailed, personal details but also some, kind of, like, poetic, purple imagery. I love, kind of, I love how it all came about with my career, but at this point, it felt like I wanted to go and run in a direction that I had never run in before, which was, I wanna be able to use whatever instruments I want, whatever drum sounds I want, whatever vocal stylings I want. I want to build and layer things, and I dont want someone to say, well, this isnt country. You know? And for me to be trying to prove that it was. So the reason this felt like a much more free experience was because I was able to write songs without the worry people would say it wasnt in the genre it was supposed to be in. So in labelling it pop and just calling it what it was, you know, when you make a pop album nobodys gonna look at it and say, well, thats not pop. So I didnt have any restraints on me.\nJason Aldean recently said something about how youre not gonna hear him writing a song about being a Wall Street stock broker because he doesnt even know where Wall Streets at, and that was the -\nHes gotta know where that is.\nI think he-\nIts in New York.\nThats where he keeps his money.\nHes gotta know. He knows where its at.\nI think he was trying to say, just why -\nI get what hes trying to say, though. Sorry, I was just, like, my dad is a stock broker who wouldve just been, like, his brain would be, like, \nI understand that thats his life and talking about, this is where I grew up, what I grew up knowing. What you grew up knowing is much different. Its international.\nYeah.\nIts the world. Youve been traveling the world for a long time.\nI completely understand what he was saying there, because, I mean, with me, its the same thing. Its like, as my life has changed, I need to continue to write about it, and I need to continue to write about even the things that change, like moving to New York and, you know, focusing more on my girlfriends rather than boyfriends. Like, these are things that are, kind of, the focal point of this new album. And as much of when I was in high school, I would sing about what my life was, which was, you know, sneaking out at night, and driving in trucks with your first boyfriend, and falling in love, and that, kind of, innocent summer romance thing, small towns, dirt roads. That was actually my life in high school. Its not anymore. So if I were to continue to write songs about that, I feel like it would be very disingenuous, and as a songwriter, thats the exact opposite of the goal Im trying to accomplish.\nIn listening to the songs Ive heard already, theyre still, theyre very much story songs. You tell a story in each one. Theres a beginning, a middle, and an end, and thats something that you focus on.\nDefinitely. I mean, I think thats kind of engrained in me, and thats the one part of my songwriting that I dont think should change as everything else does. I think that my fans have gotten used to receiving my diary entries every two years, and getting that album and going, oh, this is what shes been through the last two years.\nI meet a bunch of people who are in the public eye, but not quite like, theres nobody in the public eye like you. Theres a few on the planet, and theres nothing that could prepare you for that. Am I right? Theres nothing in life that could prepare you for that.\nI feel really lucky because I dont feel like I was shot out of a cannon, you know? A lot of people have their first single come out and it is everywhere, and all of a sudden they have a triple-platinum single, and theres all this anticipation about their album and then, all of a sudden, people start to tear them down, and it all happens over the course of six months to a year. My career build, I mean, were going on, its about nine years now since I put out my first album?\nThe record label was signed in 2005, right? The record deal rather, sorry.\nWere going on almost ten years, so its been a really, really gradual arc, and that doesnt mean that sometimes it doesnt feel that its at a crazy fever pitch that no one could ever prepare you for, but as much as you could possibly be prepared for it, I feel like time has kind of prepared me for it. I mean, some days I wake up and am absolutely overwhelmed by how abnormal my life is. Its not normal to have security with you wherever you go. Its not normal to have assistants. Its not normal to have hair and makeup every day. Its not normal -\nTo give you people heat for holding a cat a certain way on the streets of New York.\nThat cat loves being held like that!\nI know! No, I know! But you cant do anything without somebody at some point on some website, well, the cat doesnt, this isnt right for the cat to be out like that.\nThe cat loves it. The cat, heres the thing -\nIs that Olivia?\nYeah, thats Olivia. Yeah, youre right, exactly. And when everything that you do is debated upon, scrutinized, questioned, everybody feels entitled to ask you why you did everything. There are days where I feel really, really okay with that, honestly, but then there are days where I just, am kind of overwhelmed by all of it, and I think that thats okay. I try to encourage my fans that they dont have to feel confident every day, they dont have to feel happy every day, they dont have to feel pretty every day, they dont have to wanted every day. That they shouldnt put added, extra pressure on themselves to feel happy when theyre not, you know? I think being honest with yourself emotionally is really important.\nWhen you signed that record deal in 2005, is there any advice you would go back and give to that girl that was signing that day? Or because the slow and gradual build it kind of worked out? I mean, its obviously all worked out okay. What advice are you gonna give to somebody like that?\nI dont think Id wanna give her too much advice, I would... oh, I think I would tell her to laugh more. Just, you know, if you laugh at yourself first its less funny when other people make fun of you. I would also explain to her the actual definition of feminism, because I didnt know it when I was younger. I think those are two important things for girls to know, going into this business or going into life itself. But all the other things, all the really intense, times I felt serious pain or rejection or humiliation or embarrassment, those have all produced the songs Im the most proud of. There was this crazy circumstance that happened where I wrote this song Mean about the harshest criticisms Ive ever gotten. It was brutal. And that song ended up winning two Grammys.\nSpectacular, yeah. In hindsight you dont , but if you knew something was coming, if someone said to you, theres something coming around the corner, its brutal, youre gonna want to, you know, hoodie for three weeks, youre never gonna want to deal with it. But the result will be Album of the Year.\nOh my God, youd do anything for that!\nFair enough. Like I said earlier, this is one of the things you dont get to do all the time. You get to go on stage a lot, you get to be interviewed a lot, all of these things happen to you, but album releases dont happen a lot.\nThey dont.\nThey dont happen a lot.\nIm really soaking it in.\nYeah? Do you still get as excited? I know you were saying youre more proud of this than any of them.\nYeah. Im so excited, I mean, honestly. Because having spent the last year and a half, just kind of living my life on my own terms and not, not dating, not focusing on really anything else other than figuring out the album I wanted to make, theres such an incentive for me, like, Im so proud of it. And Ive always been proud of my albums, but theres something about this one, where I feel like I actually did something different this time. I actually made something that is cohesive and fits together and has its own sound and something I was so focused on. And I can be focused on my fans, and I can, you know, like, Im not tired right now during this interview. Like, Im not distracted, Im just, kind of, Im just, really taking it in.\nThe highs that you get on stage, almost nobody gets to experience, what you experience on stage. Which, again on the planet. You have one of those jobs thats very rare. Whats second to that? Whats the thing that comes the closest to the electricity that you feel when youre on stage?\nI would say its different all the time, but right now its, like, seasonal stuff. Like, I get as excited about being on stage as I get about cozy things. Because just the idea of seasons changing. This is the time of year where Im so out-of-control excited about the fact that its fall. Guess whats next? Winter.\nYes, so youre gonna have a hard time getting anybody here excited about that.\nIts two seasons that I love, and I can bake stuff all the time, and then I can give it to people. I can try out new recipes, I can wear sweaters, I can wear knee socks. I could even buy sweaters for my cats to wear.\nOkay.\nI could do any of that, because its that kind of season!\nBut thats almost as exciting as being on stage in front of forty thousand people?\nYou have to understand that if youre choosing your first place as being something like, ahhhhhhh, the second place has to be something that evens that out, which is, like, baking day with your friends.\nBut your answer really is, I dont need another high like that, because thats the one I get by going on stage.\nI think that is actually my revised answer.\nYou mentioned feminism. You have, almost by happy accident, become a real icon for girls and women, and you said earlier that that would be one of the things you might make sure you would change if you were to go back and talk to younger you, is to, kind of, narrow down that definition, or define the definition of feminism. Do you realize, kind of, how great that it is for young girls to see what youre doing? I mean, you get to experience that , right? When you talk to parents of young girls, right?\nThats awesome. Its interesting because I think that feminism is such an important conversation to be having. Especially right now, because with girls out there in the world living their lives, knowing what it means is so important, because all it means is that they feel they should be treated exactly the same way as guys. They should be given equal opportunities and rights. And I think the more people like Lena talk about it, like, Lorde and Emma Watson talk about it, and the fact that its becoming, sort of, a conversation that is top-of-mind in the media. I think its so incredible. Ive always made music so I could feel camaraderie with my fans, not in a way that was trying to cater to, kind of, any male fantasy, and that wasnt on purpose, thats just been what has felt natural to me. When asked early on about feminism in my career, I just, I think I was probably fifteen the first time I was asked about it. And so I would just say, I dont talk about politics, I dont really understand that stuff yet, so I guess Im just gonna say Im not. And I wish that when I was younger I wouldve known that its simply hoping for gender equality.\nProbably not so fair of the interviewer to ask a fifteen-year-old about that.\nYou know, thats an interesting point to make. But I think that, in the media, its very interesting to witness, on a daily basis. You know, you go online, and we all see these gossip blogs every single time we log on, because were curious and thats the society we live in. But youll see these polls, like, vote on who has a better butt! This woman or this woman? And you never see who has a better butt: this man or this man? It just never happens. Whos the hotter mama: this woman or this woman? Its not, like, whos the sexiest dad: this man or this man? You just dont see it. And people are allowed to pit women against each other and vote, and they think its an innocent thing, when really its kind of warping your mind that, you know. And if a young girl logs on and votes, its like shes going, oh my God, if that girl in my class is pretty and smart, then maybe everyones comparing me to her, and maybe I should hate her. And thats just, its feeding this negativity and I really think that with girls, kind of, banding together, in music, in culture, in movies, whatever. I think its nice to see people actually cheer each other on and girls be friends with each other, because hopefully that will kind of bleed into the classroom, and the playground, and the campus, and all that.\nI know it seems like disposable entertainment for adults, but its not only adults who are seeing this stuff.\nIts mostly not adults.\nIts mostly not adults.\nIts mostly very impressionable kids and young girls who are still forming their ideas of who they actually are. And to warp their opinions of other girls, that just adds anxiety to their life that they dont need.\nThis kind of brings me to talking about your legacy, and I know, I think five albums in its appropriate to start talking a little bit about that. Im guessing that you try very hard to make sure that the music you make, you release the things you take part in enough, that theyll all be able to stand up. Not just to the test of time, say, sonically or whatever, but that you can continue to be proud of this, is that right?\nYeah, its completely right, its dead-on. Ive always had this thing where I think about what, if Im lucky enough to have grandkids someday, what they would say. If they looked back on pictures, and videos, and things like that, and Id sure theyd laugh at me and make fun of my awkwardness and things like that. But I would never want to embarrass them. Its interesting because its like the whole role model question, like, are you a role model? Do you think about the little kids in the front row when youre doing all the things youre doing in this life? I think thats an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself, but its easier when you make it about your own life, your own legacy, when you, kind of, bring it in house, and youre, like, what if I have a five-year-old someday? And what if someday my ten-year-old goes online for the first time? Like, what do I want her to see about me?\nThats a pretty good way to look at it.\nIts something that happens very naturally where if youre, kind of, just taking accountability and responsibility for your own actions, its kind of a natural thing that happens, where, you know, all of a sudden you have parents coming up and thanking you, and youre just, sort of, like, hm, well, youre welcome. Where you were just, kind of, trying to live a good life, because I think, you know, you dont want to feel like youre the national president of the babysitters club, but you do wanna try to do good things, and make ripples, and good echoes in society, and culture, and all that.\nBut you are doing that, and in the music that Ive heard already, man, are people gonna get a kick out of hearing this, and experiencing it live. Its great, congratulations on this.\nGood. Thank you!\nIts epic. The albums out.\nThank you! Its great to talk to you, as always.\nAs always. Thanks, Taylor.\nAwesome.\nNice job.\nThanks! Youre so good!\nThank you, thank you for doing this.\nI always end up telling you stuff that Ive never thought to say in interviews.", "bad days, tell me, Ill \n look so sad?

um, up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift, and have you heard this song yet?\nI have heard this song\nTim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?\nIt was awesome. Uh, except for, I didnt know if I should, I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old?\nAh, ha ha ha\nI didnt know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more, I dont know if its true or not, but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that Im old, I dont know if thats true, but thats what I choose to think.\nWhy dont we find out. Taylor is a compliment, or uh, hes old?\nOh its definitely a compliment. Yeah. \nTim McGraw, meet Taylor Swift.\nNice-\nNice to meet you.\nNice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?\nIm doing great. How are you doing?\nIm doing good. Congratulations on your record. Its doing great.\nThank you so much. Im just so excited. Thank you for, uh, having good... music and everything. I swear Im not a stalker \nWell-\nThe funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer, some of the songs that you write like four hours, youll do them writing a song and itll be good and everything but I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes. And ya know, I really didnt think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so I kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But, um, my label heard it and was like, were putting that out.\nWell, Im glad ya did, cause, um, its doing well for ya.\nSo I-, so I understand that you two guys have not talked.\nNo.\nYou havent met.\nNo.\nNo, weve never talked or met or anything.\nI sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly\nOr something like that. Oh, I dont remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message, so, I dont know if she got it or not.\nOh my God. They never gave that to me.\nThey didnt? Okay, well, there ya go. I did. \nSo I-I.\nWeve just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.\nNot at all.\nSo I thought, I think its pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?\nIt was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know, I didnt say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking, ya know, he wouldnt take it too bad.\nWell, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad\nIm sure theres plenty that couldve been said. Tell me-\nCould you tell Faith that I said hello?\nI sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.\nOh my gosh, shes awesome.\nI agree.\nThis, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um, did this, did this really happen?\nWell, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing\nSession on Im gonna write a song called Tim McGraw\nUm, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um... .\nI actually this this is kinda strange, but I actually came up with the\nmelody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year\nof high school.\nNow I feel old.\nAnd um, I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself. And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know? That my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.\nAww, thank you.\nAnd uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first. And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano. And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes, Well, thats your first single. \nAnd Im like, well.\nWell, you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor \nThats awesome. Theres a part two coming out next month.\nAlright, great \nWell, congratulations cause its your first single. First top ten hit and thats pretty exciting. And I know youre off to the races here.\nYoure just doing great and, uh, congratulations, very exciting for you!\nAwesome, its been so exciting, Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?\nUm, I dont know. I dont know. Well have to look into that. \nWell, Ill, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.\nYa do? What would-\nYeah.\nWhat would their name be?\nUh, um, I think Taylor something.\nSomething like that, yeah\nBut.\nWell, Ill, Ill be more than happy to have you out with me.\nJust consider it.\nAh, well thats very good! Youre pretty fearless, Taylor Swift. Ill tell ya that.\nRight shes, shes gonna be forward this time.\nI think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.\nAbsolutely.\nHey Taylor, I know youre on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.\nIt was awesome and thank you.

Im Taylor, good evening. I wanna first thank Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for -\nWhoa, this is going great so far. Excellent, okay. I wanna say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their Woman of the Decade. So, what does it mean to be the Woman of this Decade? Well, it means Ive seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16. And then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless, and I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs Love Story and You Belong With Me to number one for the first time.\nAnd I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there. Whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success. Or whether it was a savvy record label; it wasnt. I saw that people love to explain away a womans success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors. Whatever they decided I couldnt do is exactly what I did.\nHuh, Ill take it, thanks! Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems, and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like Mean, Shake It Off, and Blank Space. Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist to ever win the award, with that win, came criticism and backlash in 2010 that Id never experienced before as a young, new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy? All of a sudden, they werent sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room.\nAt that time, I couldnt understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was A Swift Backlash, which is clever, you gotta give it to them. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond peoples comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, comes some sort of pushback, but I didnt know that then.\nSo then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now, and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show. I decided I would be what they said I couldnt be. I didnt know then that, soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasnt quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on, and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics.\nTheyre saying Im dating too much in my twenties? Okay, Ill stop. Ill just be single... for years. Now theyre saying my album Red is filled with too many break-up songs? Okay, Ill make one about moving to New York, and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, theyre saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music? Alright, okay, heres an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989.\nOh, you heard it? Sick! Now its that Im showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that, too. Now Im actually a calculated, manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman? Okay, Ill disappear from public view... for years. Now Im being cast as a villain to you? Okay, heres an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere.\nIn the last ten years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized, and measured up to each other, and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or, have you ever heard someone say, about a male artist, I really like his songs, but I dont know what it is, theres just something about him I dont like. No! That criticism is reserved for us. But, you know, Ive learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this: who lets that scrutiny break them, and who just keeps making art. Ive watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthly criticized -\nYes! Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career, and then slowly but surely, she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, theyve been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music. And this year, her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward, is forward motion. That we shouldnt let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us.\nAnd I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalía, Tayla Parx, Hayley Kiyoko, King Princess, Camila Cabello, Halsey, Megan Thee Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, H.E.R., Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa, Ella Mai, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now.\nFemale artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, onstage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that couldve crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didnt kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios, behind the mixing board, in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room.\nWe now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasnt around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, were always walking hand-in-hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now were able to just drop a song that we made yesterday. Ive spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators, and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still dont think that record contracts or producers agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Dont you?\nLately, theres been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up: And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in, and buying up our music, as if it is real estate. As if its an app, or a shoe line. This just happened to me without my approval, consultation, or consent. After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright, my entire catalogue was sold to Scooter Brauns Ithaca Holdings in a deal that Im told was funded by the Soros family, 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group.\nYet, to this day, none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly, to perform their due diligence on their investment, on their investment in me, to ask how I might feel about the new owner of my art. The music I wrote, the videos I created, photos of me, my handwriting, my album designs. And of course, Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale, or even when it was announced.\nIm fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though, and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, But hes always been nice to me! when Im raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music. And of course hes nice to you. If youre in this room, you have something he needs. The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media post, that he could buy me, but Im obviously not going willingly.\nYet, the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times, and I will never, ever forget it. Like, ever.\nBut to conclude, I will say that in ten years, Ive seen forward steps in our industry. In our awareness, our inclusion, our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct. Ive seen the advent of social media, the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists. And Ive seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before. Ive leaned on that support, and it has kept me in a place where, no matter what, I always wanted to keep making music for them.\nI was up on a stage in New York City in 2014, accepting Billboard Woman of the Year, and I was talking about the future of streaming. How we needed to make sure that the female artists, writers, and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly. This was before my record deal with Universal, last year, that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their Spotify shares, unrecupable. So, thank you for that.\nThis speech Im referring to was on my 25th birthday. Im about to turn thirty tonight, woo! But my exact quote during this speech was, I really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians. Because somewhere, right now, your future Woman of the Year is probably sitting in a piano lesson, or in a girls choir. And today, right now, we need to take care of her. Ive since learned that, at that exact moment, an 11-year old girl in California really was taking piano lessons, and really was in a girls choir. And this year, she has been named Woman of the Year at the age of seventeen. Her name is Billie.\nAnd those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry. The ones where peoples dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people. The ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier, makes their night more fun, makes their love feel more sacred, or their heartache feel less isolating. The ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love: music. And no matter what else enters the conversation, we will bring it back to music.\nAnd as for me, lately Ive been focusing less on doing what they say I cant do and more on doing whatever the hell I want. Thank you for a magnificent, happy, free, confused, sometimes lonely, but mostly golden decade. Im honored to be here tonight, I feel very lucky to be with you, thank you so much.", "Ooooooo-oooh\nOoooooo-oooh\nIm sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls\nHoping youll call\nIts just a cruel existence\nLike theres no point hoping at all\nBaby, baby, I feel crazy\nUp all night, all night and every day\nGive me something, oh\nBut you say nothing\nWhat is happening to me?\nAnd I dont wanna live forever\nCause I know Ill be living in vain\nAnd I dont wanna fit wherever\nI just wanna keep calling your name\nUntil you come back home \nI just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home \nI just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home\nIm sitting eyes wide open\nAnd I got one thing stuck on my mind\nWondering if I dodged a bullet\nOr just lost the love of my life, woah\nBaby, baby, I feel crazy\nUp all night, all night and every day\nI give you something, oh\nBut you give me nothing\nWhat is happening to me?\nAnd I dont wanna live forever\nCause I know Ill be living in vain\nAnd I dont wanna fit wherever\nI just wanna keep calling your name\nUntil you come back home \nI just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home \nI just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home\nIve been looking sad in all the nicest places\nI see you around in all these empty faces\nIve been looking sad in all the nicest places\nNow Im in a cab, I show him where your place is\nWhat is happening to me?\nAnd I dont wanna live forever\nCause I know Ill be living in vain\nAnd I dont wanna fit wherever \nI just wanna keep calling your name\nUntil you come back home \nI just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home \nI just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home \nI just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home \nI said I just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home \nI just wanna keep calling your name \nUntil you come back home \nUntil you come back home", "Ok, here’s the Westerly one, written in Westerly\nIm like the water when your ship rolled in that night\nRough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife\nAnd if it was an open-shut case\nI never wouldve known from the look on your face\nDrown in your current like a priceless wine\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nLife was a willow and it bent right to your wind\nHеad on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin in\nAs if you werе a mythical thing\nLike you were a trophy or a champion ring\nAnd it was only one game Id die to win\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nBegging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nAnd then I was thinking like a choral section like ...\nWait for the signal, and Ill meet you after dark\nShow me the places where the others gave you scars\nNow this is an open-shut case\nI guess I shouldve known from the look on your face\nEvery bait-and-switch was a work of art\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nBegging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nThe more that you say, the less I know\nWherever you stray, I follow\nBegging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nYou know that my train could take you home\nAnywhere else is hollow\nBegging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man\nHey, thats my man\nYeah, thats my man\nYeah, thats my man\nEvery bait-and-switch was a work of art\nThats my man\nHey, thats my man\nIm begging for you to take my hand\nWreck my plans, thats my man", "City of Lover♡\n1.

They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the characters does. It’s something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment.\nIm highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear Cowboy Take Me Away by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. Im clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house. When I hear I Write Sins Not Tragedies by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics. When I hear How to Save a Life by The Fray, Breathe  by Anna Nalick, or The Story by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When Id get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs . Im convinced that You Learn by Alanis Morissette, Put Your Records On by Corinne Bailey Rae and Why by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs.\nI love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when Im writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever.\nThe fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. Youd think that as pop writers, were supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so youd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. .\nIn modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like Kiki, do you love me and Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level. This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana.\nI think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, this is what I went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. Its this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time.

mahogany. The space is warm and cozy and vaguely literary—later, when we pass through her bedroom en route to her garden, 10 percent of my brain will believe her wardrobe might open up to Narnia. Barefoot in a wine-colored floral top and matching flowy pants, Swift is typing passwords into a laptop to show me the video for “You Need to Calm Down,” eight days before she unleashes it on the world.\nI have a sliver of an idea what to expect. A few weeks earlier, I spent a day at the video shoot, in a dusty field-slash-junkyard north of Los Angeles. Swift had made it a sort of Big Gay Candy Mountain trailer park, a Technicolor happy place. The cast and crew wore heart-shaped sunglasses—living, breathing lovey-eyes emoji—and a mailbox warned, LOVE LETTERS ONLY.\nSwift and a stream of costars filmed six scenes over about a dozen hours. The singer-songwriter Hayley Kiyoko, known to her fans as “Lesbian Jesus,” shot arrows at a bull’s-eye. The YouTube comedian-chef Hannah Hart danced alongside Dexter Mayfield, the plus-size male model and self-described “big boy in heels.” The Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon served up icy red snow cones. Swift and her close friend Todrick Hall, of Kinky Boots and RuPaul’s Drag Race, sipped tea with the cast of Queer Eye.\nThe mood was joyous and laid-back. But by the end of the day, I wasn’t sure what the vignettes would add up to. There were shoot days and cameos I wouldn’t observe. For security reasons, the song was never played aloud. Even the hero shot, in which Swift and Hall sauntered arm in arm through the dreamscape at golden hour, was filmed in near-total silence.\nFor weeks afterward, I tried to sleuth out a theory. I started casually. There was a “5” on the bull’s-eye, so I did a quick search to figure out what that number might mean. Immediately I was in over my head.\nSwift has a thing for symbols. I knew she had been embedding secret messages in liner notes and deploying metaphors as refrains since her self-titled debut in 2006—long before her megafame made her into a symbol of pop supremacy. But I hadn’t understood how coded and byzantine her body of work has become; I hadn’t learned, as Swift’s fans have, to see hidden meanings everywhere. For instance: In the 2017 video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” a headstone in a graveyard scene reads NILS SJOBERG, the pseudonym Swift used as her writing credit on Rihanna’s hit “This Is What You Came For,” a Swedish-sounding nod to that country’s pop wizards.\nAfter an excessive amount of ad hoc scholarship—a friend joked that I could have learned Mandarin in the time I spent trying to unpack Swift’s oeuvre—I was no closer to a theory. Pop music has become so layered and meta, but the Taylor Swift Universe stands apart. Apprehending it is like grasping quantum physics.\nMy first indication of what her new album, Lover, would be about came just after midnight on June 1, the beginning of Pride Month, when Swift introduced a petition in support of the federal Equality Act. This legislation would amend the Civil Rights Act to outlaw discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. Swift also posted a letter to Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, asking him to vote yes. The request, on her personal letterhead , denounced President Trump for not supporting the Equality Act. “I personally reject the president’s stance,” Swift wrote.\nBack in the kitchen, Swift hits play. “The first verse is about trolls and cancel culture,” she says. “The second verse is about homophobes and the people picketing outside our concerts. The third verse is about successful women being pitted against each other.”\nThe video is, for erudite Swifties, a rich text. I had followed enough clues to correctly guess some of the other cameos—Ellen DeGeneres, RuPaul, Katy Perry. I felt the satisfaction of a gamer who successfully levels up—achievement unlocked! The video’s final frame sends viewers to Swift’s change.org petition in support of the Equality Act, which has acquired more than 400,000 signatures—including those of Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke, and Kirsten Gillibrand—or four times the number required to elicit an official response from the White House.\n“Maybe a year or two ago, Todrick and I are in the car, and he asked me, What would you do if your son was gay?”\nWe are upstairs in Swift’s secret garden, comfortably ensconced in a human-scale basket that is sort of shaped like a cocoon. Swift has brought up an ornate charcuterie board and is happily slathering triple-cream Brie onto sea-salt crackers. “The fact that he had to ask me . . . shocked me and made me realize that I had not made my position clear enough or loud enough,” she says. “If my son was gay, he’d be gay. I don’t understand the question.”\nI have pressed Swift on this topic, and her answers have been direct, not performative or scripted. I do sense that she enjoys talking to me about as much as she’d enjoy a root canal—but she’s unfailingly polite, and when we turn to music, her face will light up and she will add little melodic phrases to her speech, clearly her preferred language.\nIf he was thinking that, I can’t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ community might be thinking,” she goes on. “It was kind of devastating to realize that I hadn’t been publicly clear about that.”\nI understand why she was surprised; she has been sending pro-LGBTQ signals since at least 2011. Many have been subtle, but none insignificant—especially for a young country star coming out of Nashville.\nIn the video for her single “Mean” , we see a boy in a school locker room wearing a lavender sweater and bow tie, surrounded by football players. In “Welcome to New York,” the first track on 1989, she sings, “And you can want who you want. Boys and boys and girls and girls.” Two years later, she donated to a fund for the newly created Stonewall National Monument and presented Ruby Rose with a GLAAD Media Award. Every night of last year’s Reputation tour, she dedicated the song “Dress” to Loie Fuller, the openly gay pioneer of modern dance and theatrical lighting who captured the imagination of fin-de-siècle Paris.\nSwift, who has been criticized for keeping her politics to herself, first took an explicit stance a month before the 2018 midterms. On Instagram, she endorsed Democrats for the Tennessee Legislature and called out the Republican running for Senate, Marsha Blackburn. “She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples,” Swift wrote. “She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.”\nSwift says the post was partly to help young fans understand that if they wanted to vote, they had to register. To tell them, as she puts it, “Hey, just so you know, you can’t just roll up.” Some 65,000 new voters registered in the first 24 hours after her post, according to Vote.org.\nTrump came to Blackburn’s defense the following day. “She’s a tremendous woman,” he told reporters. “I’m sure Taylor Swift doesn’t know anything about her. Let’s say I like Taylor’s music about 25 percent less now, OK?”\nIn April, spurred by a raft of anti-LGBTQ bills in Tennessee, Swift donated $113,000 to the Tennessee Equality Project, which advocates for LGBTQ rights. “Horrendous,” she says of the legislation. “They don’t call it ‘Slate of Hate’ for nothing.” Swift especially liked that the Tennessee Equality Project had organized a petition of faith leaders in opposition. “I loved how smart it was to come at it from a religious perspective.”\nMeanwhile, the “Calm Down” video provoked a Colorado pastor to call Swift “a sinner in desperate need of a savior” and warn that “God will cut her down.” It also revived heated debate within LGBTQ communities about the politics of allyship and corporatization of Pride. Some critics argued Swift’s pro-LGBTQ imagery and lyrics were overdue and out of the blue—a reaction the new Swift scholar in me found bewildering. Had they not been paying attention?\nNor did it strike me as out of character for Swift to leverage her power for a cause. She pulled her catalog from Spotify in 2014 over questions of artist compensation. She stared down Apple in 2015, when the company said it would not pay artists during the launch of its music service. As a condition of her record deal with Universal Music Group last year, the company promised that it would distribute proceeds from any sale of its Spotify shares to all of its artists. And this summer, Swift furiously called out Scott Borchetta, founder of Big Machine Label Group, for selling her master recordings to the music manager Scooter Braun. \nSwift’s blunt testimony during her 2017 sexual-assault case against a radio DJ—months before the #MeToo reckoning blew open—felt deeply political to me and, I imagine, many other women. Swift accused the DJ, David Mueller, of groping her under her skirt at a photo session in 2013. Her camp reported the incident to his employer, who fired him. Mueller denied the allegation, sued Swift for $3 million, and his case was thrown out. Swift countersued for a symbolic $1 and won.\nIn a Colorado courtroom, Swift described the incident: “He stayed latched onto my bare ass cheek” as photos were being snapped. Asked why photos of the front of her skirt didn’t show this, she said, “Because my ass is located at the back of my body.” Asked if she felt bad about the DJ’s losing his job, she said, “I’m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions—not mine.”\nWhen Time included Swift on the cover of its “Silence Breakers” issue that year, the magazine asked how she felt during the testimony. “I was angry,” she said. “In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened...I’m told it was the most amount of times the word ass has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.”\nMueller has since paid Swift the dollar—with a Sacagawea coin. “He was trolling me, implying that I was self-righteous and hell-bent on angry, vengeful feminism. That’s what I’m inferring from him giving me a Sacagawea coin,” Swift says. “Hey, maybe he was trying to do it in honor of a powerful Native American woman. I didn’t ask.” Where is the coin now? “My lawyer has it.”\nI ask her, why get louder about LGBTQ rights now? “Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male,” she says. “I didn’t realize until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of. It’s hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. Because my mistakes are very loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world. It’s clickbait, and it’s a part of my life story, and it’s a part of my career arc.”\nI’d argue that no heterosexual woman can listen to “You Need to Calm Down” and hear only a gay anthem. “Calm down” is what controlling men tell women who are angry, contrary, or “hysterical,” or, let’s say, fearing for their physical safety. It is what Panic! at the Disco singer Brendon Urie says to Swift in the beginning of the “ME!” music video, prompting her to scream, “Je suis calme!”\nI cannot believe it is a coincidence that Swift, a numbers geek with an affinity for dates, dropped the single—whose slow, incessant bass is likely to be bumping in stadiums across the world in 2020 if she goes on tour—on June 14, a certain president’s birthday.\nIt’s enlightening to read 13 years of Taylor Swift coverage—all the big reviews, all the big profiles—in one sitting. You notice things.\nHow quickly Swift went from a “prodigy” and a “songwriting savant” to a tabloid fixture, for instance. Or how suspect her ambition is made to seem once she acquires real power.\nOther plot points simply look different in the light of #MeToo. It is hard to imagine that Swift’s songs about her exes would be reviewed as sensationally today. I wonder if, in 2019, any man would dare grab the microphone out of a young woman’s hands at an awards show. I stared into space for a good long while when I was reminded that Pitchfork did not review Taylor Swift’s 1989 but did review Ryan Adams’s cover album of Taylor Swift’s 1989.\nI ask Swift if she had always been aware of sexism. “I think about this a lot,” she says. “When I was a teenager, I would hear people talk about sexism in the music industry, and I’d be like, I don’t see it. I don’t understand. Then I realized that was because I was a kid. Men in the industry saw me as a kid. I was a lanky, scrawny, overexcited young girl who reminded them more of their little niece or their daughter than a successful woman in business or a colleague. The second I became a woman, in people’s perception, was when I started seeing it.\n“It’s fine to infantilize a girl’s success and say, How cute that she’s having some hit songs,” she goes on. “How cute that she’s writing songs. But the second it becomes formidable? As soon as I started playing stadiums—when I started to look like a woman—that wasn’t as cool anymore. It was when I started to have songs from Red come out and cross over, like ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ and ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.’ ”\nThose songs are also more assertive than the ones that came before, I say. “Yeah, the angle was different when I started saying, I knew you were trouble when you walked in. Basically, you emotionally manipulated me and I didn’t love it. That wasn’t fun for me.”\nI have to wonder if having her songwriting overlooked as her hits were picked apart and scrutinized wasn’t the biggest bummer of all. Swift: “I wanted to say to people, You realize writing songs is an art and a craft and not, like, an easy thing to do? Or to do well? People would act like it was a weapon I was using. Like a cheap dirty trick. Be careful, bro, she’ll write a song about you. Don’t stand near her. First of all, that’s not how it works. Second of all, find me a time when they say that about a male artist: Be careful, girl, he’ll use his experience with you to get—God forbid—inspiration to make art.”\nWithout question the tenor of the Taylor Swift Narrative changed most dramatically in July 2016, when Kim Kardashian West called her a “snake” on Twitter, and released video clips of Swift and Kanye West discussing the lyrics to his song “Famous.” The posts sparked several hashtags, including #TaylorSwiftIsASnake and #TaylorSwiftIsCanceled, which quickly escalated into a months-long campaign to “cancel” Swift.\nTo this day Swift doesn’t think people grasp the repercussions of that term. “A mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote canceled, is a very isolating experience,” she says. “I don’t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it’s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly.” She adds: “When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself.”\nAn overhaul was in order. “I realized I needed to restructure my life because it felt completely out of control,” Swift says. “I knew immediately I needed to make music about it because I knew it was the only way I could survive it. It was the only way I could preserve my mental health and also tell the story of what it’s like to go through something so humiliating.”\nI get a sense of the whiplash Swift experienced when I notice that, a few months into this ordeal, while she was writing the songs that an interpolation of a ’90s camp classic, Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy.”) Nonetheless, most critics read it as a grenade lobbed in the general direction of Calabasas.\nOne longtime Nashville critic, Brian Mansfield, had a more plausible take: She was writing sarcastically as the “Taylor Swift” portrayed in the media in a bid for privacy. “Yeah, this is the character you created for me, let me just hide behind it,” she says now of the persona she created. “I always used this metaphor when I was younger. I’d say that with every reinvention, I never wanted to tear down my house. ’Cause I built this house. This house being, metaphorically, my body of work, my songwriting, my music, my catalog, my library. I just wanted to redecorate. I think a lot of people, with Reputation, would have perceived that I had torn down the house. Actually, I just built a bunker around it.”\nIn March, the snakes started to morph into butterflies, the vampire color palette into Easter pastels. When a superbloom of wildflowers lured a mesmerizing deluge of Painted Lady butterflies to Los Angeles, Swift marked it with an Instagram post. She attended the iHeartRadio Music Awards that night in a sequin romper and stilettos with shimmery wings attached.\nSwift announced the single “ME!” a month later, with a large butterfly mural in Nashville. In the music video for the bubblegum song, a hissing pastel-pink snake explodes into a kaleidoscope of butterflies. One flutters by the window of an apartment, where Swift is arguing in French with Urie. A record player is playing in the background. “It’s an old-timey, 1940s-sounding instrumental version of ‘You Need to Calm Down,’ ’’ Swift says. Later, in the “Calm Down” video, Swift wears a back tattoo of a snake swarmed by butterflies.\nWe are only two songs in, people. Lover, to be released on August 23, will have a total of 18 songs. “I was compiling ideas for a very long time,” Swift says. “When I started writing, I couldn’t stop.” \nSwift thinks Lover might be her favorite album yet. “There are so many ways in which this album feels like a new beginning,” she says. “This album is really a love letter to love, in all of its maddening, passionate, exciting, enchanting, horrific, tragic, wonderful glory.”\nI have to ask Swift, given how genuinely at peace she seems, if part of her isn’t thankful, if not for the Great Cancellation of 2016, then for the person she now is—knowing who her friends are, knowing what’s what. “When you’re going through loss or embarrassment or shame, it’s a grieving process with so many micro emotions in a day. One of the reasons why I didn’t do interviews for Reputation was that I couldn’t figure out how I felt hour to hour. Sometimes I felt like: All these things taught me something that I never could have learned in a way that didn’t hurt as much. Five minutes later, I’d feel like: That was horrible. Why did that have to happen? What am I supposed to take from this other than mass amounts of humiliation? And then five minutes later I’d think: I think I might be happier than I’ve ever been.”\nShe goes on: “It’s so strange trying to be self-aware when you’ve been cast as this always smiling, always happy ‘America’s sweetheart’ thing, and then having that taken away and realizing that it’s actually a great thing that it was taken away, because that’s extremely limiting.” Swift leans back in the cocoon and smiles: “We’re not going to go straight to gratitude with it. Ever. But we’re going to find positive aspects to it. We’re never going to write a thank-you note.”\nThough people will take the Perry-Swift burger-and-fries embrace in the “You Need to Calm Down” video as a press release that the two have mended fences, Swift says it’s actually a comment on how the media pits female pop stars against one another. After Perry sent Swift an olive branch last year, Swift asked her to be in the video: “She wrote back, This makes me so emotional. I’m so up for this. I want us to be that example. But let’s spend some time together. Because I want it to be real. So she came over and we talked for hours.\n“We decided the metaphor for what happens in the media,” Swift explains, “is they pick two people and it’s like they’re pouring gasoline all over the floor. All that needs to happen is one false move, one false word, one misunderstanding, and a match is lit and dropped. That’s what happened with us. It was: Who’s better? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? The tension is so high that it becomes impossible for you to not think that the other person has something against you.\nMeanwhile, the protesters in the video reference a real-life religious group that pickets outside Swift’s concerts, not the white working class in general, as some have assumed. “So many artists have them at their shows, and it’s such a confounding, confusing, infuriating thing to have outside of joyful concerts,” she tells me. “Obviously I don’t want to mention the actual entity, because they would get excited about that. Giving them press is not on my list of priorities.”\nAt one point, Swift asks if I would like to hear two other songs off the new album. First she plays “Lover,” the title track, coproduced by Jack Antonoff. “This has one of my favorite bridges,” she says. “I love a bridge, and I was really able to go to Bridge City.” It’s a romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget: classic Swift. “My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue,” she sings. “All’s well that ends well to end up with you.”\nNext, Swift cues up a track that “plays with the idea of perception.” She has often wondered how she would be written and spoken about if she were a man, “so I wrote a song called ‘The Man.’ ” It’s a thought experiment of sorts: “If I had made all the same choices, all the same mistakes, all the same accomplishments, how would it read?” Seconds later, Swift’s earpods are pumping a synth-pop earworm into my head: “I’d be a fearless leader. I’d be an alpha type. When everyone believes ya: What’s that like?”\nSwift wrote the first two singles with Joel Little, best known as one of Lorde’s go-to producers. The album is likely to include more marquee names. A portrait of the Dixie Chicks in the background of the “ME!” video almost certainly portends a collaboration. If fans are correctly reading a button affixed to her denim jacket in a recent magazine cover, we can expect one with Drake, too.\nSpeaking of: Inquiring fans will want to know if Swift dropped any more clues about how to decode Lover during this interview. For you I reviewed the audio again, and there were a few things that made my newly acquired Swifty sense tingle.\nAt one point she compared superstardom in the digital age to life in a dollhouse, one where voyeurs “can ‘ship’ you with who they want to ‘ship’ you with, and they can ‘favorite’ friends that you have, and they can know where you are all the time.” The metaphor was precise and vivid and, well, a little too intricately rendered to be off the cuff. \nThen there was the balloon—a giant gold balloon in the shape of a numeral seven that happened to float by while we were on her roof, on this, the occasion of her seventh album. “Is it an L’?” I say. “No, because look, the string is hanging from the bottom,” she says.\nIt might seem an obvious symbolic gesture, deployed for this interview, except for how impossible that seems. Swift let me control the timing of nearly everything. Moreover, the gold seven wasn’t floating up from the sidewalk below. It was already high in the sky, drifting slowly toward us from down the street. She would have had to control the wind, or at least to have studied it. Would Taylor Swift really go to such elaborate lengths for her fans? This much I know: Yes, she would.", "Knew he was a killer\nFirst time that I saw him\nWonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted\nBut if hes a ghost then I can be a phantom\nHoldin him for

This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs.\nThese are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.\nI realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out.\nThree months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.\nBut I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.\nTaylor", "I stay up too late\nGot nothing in my brain\nThats what people say \nThats what people say \nI go on too many

all, set against a pastel blue backdrop with superimposed stars. It appeared that a new Taylor Swift era was upon us — that the old happy-go-lucky Taylor was not, in fact, dead. Or did it? It was only an Instagram photo, just one more picture in an infinite content scroll. But it also came from a pop star known for prodigious hint-dropping, whose fans turn every piece of info into an online archaeological dig.\nAs expected, the summery post sent Swifties sifting through each detail with a fine-tooth comb. What did the trees symbolize? An overdue vacation? A recently purchased beach house? A secret palm-frond collection? Or maybe, as many surmised, it was new music. One Twitter user predicted that the number of stars in the background of the photo hinted at a single drop: “There’s about 60/61 ️. There’s 61 days until April 26, FRIDAY, a SINGLE RELEASE day!” Another said it was the unofficial announcement of her next LP: “Okay so in this picture there are 4 palm trees on the left . There are two palm trees on the right . There is one large palm tree in the middle. This represents her new album.” These may sound like ludicrous conspiracy theories — for the record, they were mostly correct — but they fit firmly within the Taylor Swift Musical Universe .\n“I posted that the day that I finished the seventh album,” says Swift about the photo. “I couldn’t expect to know that. I figured they’d figure it out later, but a lot of their theories were actually correct. Those Easter eggs were just trying to establish that tone, which I foreshadowed ages ago in a Spotify vertical video for ‘Delicate’ by painting my nails those colors.”\nIt’s now April, and the 29-year-old pop star is in a Los Angeles photo studio, giving her first sit-down magazine interview in three years. She wants to discuss the art of placing hints inside her work, as well as the upcoming record, which she recorded as soon as she finished the Reputation Tour. She’s also keen on detailing her own obsessions, talking up the TV shows, books, and songs that help shape her outlook on life.\nOver the past 13 years, Swift has perfected the pop culture feedback loop: She shares updates about her life and drops hints about new music, which fans then gobble up and re-promote with their own theories, which Swift then re-shares on her Tumblr or incorporates into future clues. It’s like a T-Swift-built Escher staircase of personal memories and moments that tease what’s next. “I’ve trained them to be that way,” she says of her fans’ astute detective work. Swift is a pop culture fanatic herself and has an innate understanding of the lengths her audience will go to be a part of the original creation. “I love that they like the cryptic hint-dropping. Because as long as they like it, I’ll keep doing it. It’s fun. It feels mischievous and playful.”\nThrough this approach, Swift has designed the ultimate artistic scavenger hunt — and it’s easy to get swept up in its drama, even if you don’t listen to her music. Her moments aren’t always hidden, either. Sometimes Swift highlights aspects of her world just so fans feel like they’re on the journey with her. Like the time in March 2018 when pop singer Hayley Kiyoko was accused of shading Swift after mentioning her name during an interview. On Tumblr, Swift re-shared a fan’s post, adding commentary that defended Kiyoko, which immediately dispelled any conflicts between the two artists; Swift’s post subsequently received more than 29,000 notes. Four months later, she invited Kiyoko on stage during the Reputation Tour to sing her hit “Curious.” Kiyoko returned the favor when she had Swift join her that December at a benefit on behalf of the LGBTQ organization the Ally Coalition to perform “Delicate.” Fans of both artists were elated by the mutual support.\nThe feedback loop also extends outside of music. In October 2018, Swift broke her silence about politics by publicly endorsing two candidates for office in her adopted state of Tennessee, while encouraging her followers to register to vote. She kept up the civic momentum through Election Day when she asked fans to post selfies after voting; Swift then eagerly re-promoted her favorites on Instagram stories.\nThis practice of sharing and re-sharing and sharing again is why listeners consider Swift one of the world’s most accessible pop stars, someone willing to not only interact with her audience but invite them to secret listening sessions, or make the occasional surprise visit to their wedding or prom. It’s a symbiotic relationship, one that, as Swift tells EW, helped her dig out of the darker era of reputation. “It’s definitely the fans that made that tonal shift in the way I was feeling,” she says. “Songwriters need to communicate, and part of communicating correctly is when you put out a message that is understood the way you meant it. reputation was interesting because I’d never before had an album that wasn’t fully understood until it was seen live. When it first came out everyone thought it was just going to be angry; upon listening to the whole thing they realized it’s actually about love and friendship, and finding out what your priorities are.”\nThen, during the Reputation Tour, she had an epiphany: that despite the caricature that she thought had been created of her, there were many people who saw what others had simply refused to. “I would look out into the audience and I’d see these amazing, thoughtful, caring, wonderful, empathetic people,” she says. “So often with our takedown culture, talking s— about a celebrity is basically the same as talking s— about the new iPhone. So when I go and I meet fans, I see that they actually see me as a flesh-and-blood human being. That — as contrived as it may sound — changed completely, assigning humanity to my life.”\nAt tour’s end, she channeled that positive energy into the studio, recording the new album in just under three months. But the fast pace won’t mean a short LP. Swift confirmed that her seventh record will include more songs than any of her previous releases. “I try not to go into making an album with any expectation,” she says. “I started to write so much that I knew immediately it would probably be bigger.”\nThe project will also feature a mix of old and new collaborators , but she is unsurprisingly coy about doling out much more information, as if doing so would break the carefully honed T-Swiftian feedback loop. “There’s a lot of a lot on this album,” she says. “I’m trying to convey an emotional spectrum. I definitely don’t wanna have too much of one thing…. You get some joyful songs and you get the bops, as they say.” There’s also, she adds, some “really, really, really, really sad songs,” but “not enough to where you need to worry about me.”\nShe gives us one more clue: The true distinction between TS7 and reputation is in the delivery. “This time around I feel more comfortable being brave enough to be vulnerable, because my fans are brave enough to be vulnerable with me. Once people delve into the album, it’ll become pretty clear that that’s more of the fingerprint of this — that it’s much more of a singer-songwriter, personal journey than the last one.”\nThe past month has seen a deluge of Swift activity, from the release of the new single to dropping more hints in interviews about the record and its title, which is apparently hidden somewhere inside the “ME!” music video . But if the Easter eggs from the pop star seem like a business-as-usual routine, she says this album does indeed mark a new era of her life, where she’s been better able to prioritize what’s important to her.\n“Our priorities can get messed up existing in a society that puts a currency on curating the way people see your life,” she says. “Social media has given people a way to express their art. I use it to connect with fans. But on the downside you feel like there are 3 trillion new invisible hoops that you have to jump through, and you feel like you’ll never be able to jump through them all correctly. I — along with a lot of my friends and fans — am trying to figure out how to navigate living my life and not just curating what I want people to think living my life is. I’m not always able to maintain a balance, and I think that’s important for everyone to know about. We’re always learning, and that’s something that I also had to learn — that I’ve got to be brave enough to learn. Learning in public is so humiliating sometimes…. Do I feel more balanced in my life than I ever have before? Um, probably yeah. But is that permanent? No. And I think being okay with that has put me in a bit of a better position.” Strong words to live by, to quote, to re-share, to tweet back to her, and see if she’ll respond.", "I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.\nI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.\nSo many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info.

It’s all in keeping with the pastel aesthetic of her new album, Lover; black-leather combat-Taylor from her previous album cycle has handed back the phone. Around the black-granite kitchen island, all is calm and normal, as Swift’s mom, dad, and younger brother pass through. Her mom’s two dogs, one very small, one very large, pounce upon visitors with slurping glee. It could be any 29-year-old’s weekend visit with her parents, if not for the madness looming a few feet down the hall.\nIn an airy terrace, 113 giddy, weepy, shaky, still-in-disbelief fans are waiting for the start of one of Swift’s secret sessions, sacred rituals in Swift-dom. She’s about to play them her seventh album, as-yet unreleased on this Sunday afternoon in early August, and offer copious commentary. Also, she made cookies. Just before the session, Swift sits down in her mom’s study to chat for a few minutes. The black-walled room is decorated with black-and-white classic-rock photos, including shots of Bruce Springsteen and, unsurprisingly, James Taylor; there are also more recent shots of Swift posing with Kris Kristofferson and playing with Def Leppard, her mom’s favorite band.\nIn a corner is an acoustic guitar Swift played as a teenager. She almost certainly wrote some well-known songs on it, but can’t recall which ones. “It would be kind of weird to finish a song and be like, ‘And this moment, I shall remember,’” she says, laughing. “‘This guitar hath been anointed with my sacred tuneage!”\nThe secret session itself is, as the name suggests, deeply off-the-record; it can be confirmed that she drank some white wine, since her glass pops up in some Instagram pictures. She stays until 5 a.m., chatting and taking photos with every one of the fans. Five hours later, we continue our talk at length in Swift’s Nashville condo, in almost exactly the same spot where we did one of our interviews for her 2012 Rolling Stone cover story. She’s hardly changed its whimsical decor in the past seven years , so it’s an old-Taylor time capsule. There’s still a huge bunny made of moss in one corner, and a human-size birdcage in the living room, though the view from the latter is now of generic new condo buildings instead of just distant green hills. Swift is barefoot now, in pale-blue jeans and a blue button-down tied at the waist; her hair is pulled back, her makeup minimal.\nHow to sum up the past three years of Taylor Swift? In July 2016, after Swift expressed discontent with Kanye West’s “Famous,” Kim Kardashian did her best to destroy her, unleashing clandestine recordings of a phone conversation between Swift and West. In the piecemeal audio, Swift can be heard agreeing to the line “…me and Taylor might still have sex.” We don’t hear her learning about the next lyric, the one she says bothered her — “I made that bitch famous” — and as she’ll explain, there’s more to her side of the story. The backlash was, well, swift, and overwhelming. It still hasn’t altogether subsided. Later that year, Swift chose not to make an endorsement in the 2016 election, which definitely didn’t help. In the face of it all, she made Reputation — fierce, witty, almost-industrial pop offset by love songs of crystalline beauty — and had a wildly successful stadium tour. Somewhere in there, she met her current boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, and judging by certain songs on Lover, the relationship is serious indeed.\nLover is Swift’s most adult album, a rebalancing of sound and persona that opens doors to the next decade of her career; it’s also a welcome return to the sonic diversity of 2012’s Red, with tracks ranging from the St. Vincent-assisted über-bop “Cruel Summer” to the unbearably poignant country-fied “Soon You’ll Get Better” and the “Shake It Off”-worthy pep of “Paper Rings.”\nShe wants to talk about the music, of course, but she is also ready to explain the past three years of her life, in depth, for the first time. The conversation is often not a light one. She’s built up more armor in the past few years, but still has the opposite of a poker face — you can see every micro-emotion wash over her as she ponders a question, her nose wrinkling in semi-ironic offense at the term “old-school pop stars,” her preposterously blue eyes glistening as she turns to darker subjects. In her worst moments, she says, “You feel like you’re being completely pulled into a riptide. So what are you going to do? Splash a lot? Or hold your breath and hope you somehow resurface? And that’s what I did. And it took three years. Sitting here doing an interview — the fact that we’ve done an interview before is the only reason I’m not in a full body sweat.”\nWhen we talked seven years ago, everything was going so well for you, and you were very worried that something would go wrong.\nYeah, I kind of knew it would. I felt like I was walking along the sidewalk, knowing eventually the pavement was going to crumble and I was gonna fall through. You can’t keep winning and have people like it. People love “new” so much — they raise you up the flagpole, and you’re waving at the top of the flagpole for a while. And then they’re like, “Wait, this new flag is what we actually love.” They decide something you’re doing is incorrect, that you’re not standing for what you should stand for. You’re a bad example. Then if you keep making music and you survive, and you keep connecting with people, eventually they raise you a little bit up the flagpole again, and then they take you back down, and back up again. And it happens to women more than it happens to men in music.\nIt also happened to you a few times on a smaller scale, didn’t it?\nI’ve had several upheavals in my career. When I was 18, they were like, “She doesn’t really write those songs.” So my third album I wrote by myself as a reaction to that. Then they decided I was a serial dater — a boy-crazy man-eater — when I was 22. And so I didn’t date anyone for, like, two years. And then they decided in 2016 that absolutely everything about me was wrong. If I did something good, it was for the wrong reasons. If I did something brave, I didn’t do it correctly. If I stood up for myself, I was throwing a tantrum. And so I found myself in this endless mockery echo chamber. It’s just like — I have a brother who’s two and a half years younger, and we spent the first half of our lives trying to kill each other and the second half as best friends. You know that game kids play? I’d be like, “Mom, can I have some water?” And Austin would be like, “Mom, can I have some water?” And I’m like, “He’s copying me.” And he’d be like, “He’s copying me.” Always in a really obnoxious voice that sounds all twisted. That’s what it felt like in 2016. So I decided to just say nothing. It wasn’t really a decision. It was completely involuntary.\nBut you also had good things happen in your life at the same time — that’s part of Reputation.\nThe moments of my true story on that album are songs like “Delicate,” “New Year’s Day,” “Call It What You Want,” “Dress.” The one-two punch, bait-and-switch of Reputation is that it was actually a love story. It was a love story in amongst chaos. All the weaponized sort of metallic battle anthems were what was going on outside. That was the battle raging on that I could see from the windows, and then there was what was happening inside my world — my newly quiet, cozy world that was happening on my own terms for the first time. . . . It’s weird, because in some of the worst times of my career, and reputation, dare I say, I had some of the most beautiful times — in my quiet life that I chose to have. And I had some of the most incredible memories with the friends I now knew cared about me, even if everyone hated me. The bad stuff was really significant and damaging. But the good stuff will endure. The good lessons — you realize that you can’t just show your life to people.\nMeaning?\nI used to be like a golden retriever, just walking up to everybody, like, wagging my tail. “Sure, yeah, of course! What do you want to know? What do you need?” Now, I guess, I have to be a little bit more like a fox.\nDo your regrets on that extend to the way the “girl squad” thing was perceived?\nYeah, I never would have imagined that people would have thought, “This is a clique that wouldn’t have accepted me if I wanted to be in it.” Holy shit, that hit me like a ton of bricks. I was like, “Oh, this did not go the way that I thought it was going to go.” I thought it was going to be we can still stick together, just like men are allowed to do. The patriarchy allows men to have bro packs. If you’re a male artist, there’s an understanding that you have respect for your counterparts.\nWhereas women are expected to be feuding with each other?\nIt’s assumed that we hate each other. Even if we’re smiling and photographed together with our arms around each other, it’s assumed there’s a knife in our pocket.\nHow much of a danger was there of falling into that thought pattern yourself?\nThe messaging is dangerous, yes. Nobody is immune, because we’re a product of what society and peer groups and now the internet tells us, unless we learn differently from experience.\nYou once sang about a star who “took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.” In 2016, you wrote in your journal, “This summer is the apocalypse.” How close did you come to quitting altogether?\nI definitely thought about that a lot. I thought about how words are my only way of making sense of the world and expressing myself — and now any words I say or write are being twisted against me. People love a hate frenzy. It’s like piranhas. People had so much fun hating me, and they didn’t really need very many reasons to do it. I felt like the situation was pretty hopeless. I wrote a lot of really aggressively bitter poems constantly. I wrote a lot of think pieces that I knew I’d never publish, about what it’s like to feel like you’re in a shame spiral. And I couldn’t figure out how to learn from it. Because I wasn’t sure exactly what I did that was so wrong. That was really hard for me, because I cannot stand it when people can’t take criticism. So I try to self-examine, and even though that’s really hard and hurts a lot sometimes, I really try to understand where people are coming from when they don’t like me. And I completely get why people wouldn’t like me. Because, you know, I’ve had my insecurities say those things — and things 1,000 times worse.\nBut some of your former critics have become your friends, right?\nSome of my best friendships came from people publicly criticizing me and then it opening up a conversation. Hayley Kiyoko was doing an interview and she made an example about how I get away with singing about straight relationships and people don’t give me shit the way they give her shit for singing about girls — and it’s totally valid. Like, Ella — Lorde — the first thing she ever said about me publicly was a criticism of my image or whatever. But I can’t really respond to someone saying, “You, as a human being, are fake.” And if they say you’re playing the victim, that completely undermines your ability to ever verbalize how you feel unless it’s positive. So, OK, should I just smile all the time and never say anything hurts me? Because that’s really fake. Or should I be real about how I’m feeling and have valid, legitimate responses to things that happened to me in my life? But wait, would that be playing the victim?\nHow do you escape that mental trap?\nSince I was 15 years old, if people criticized me for something, I changed it. So you realize you might be this amalgamation of criticisms that were hurled at you, and not an actual person who’s made any of these choices themselves. And so I decided I needed to live a quiet life, because a quiet personal life invites no discussion, dissection, and debate. I didn’t realize I was inviting people to feel they had the right to sort of play my life like a video game.\n“The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Because she’s dead!” was funny — but how seriously should we take it?\nThere’s a part of me that definitely is always going to be different. I needed to grow up in many ways. I needed to make boundaries, to figure out what was mine and what was the public’s. That old version of me that shares unfailingly and unblinkingly with a world that is probably not fit to be shared with? I think that’s gone. But it was definitely just, like, a fun moment in the studio with me and Jack where I wanted to play on the idea of a phone call — because that’s how all of this started, a stupid phone call I shouldn’t have picked up.\nIt would have been much easier if that’s what you’d just said.\nIt would have been so, so great if I would have just said that .\nSome of the Lover iconography does suggest old Taylor’s return, though.\nI don’t think I’ve ever leaned into the old version of myself more creatively than I have on this album, where it’s very, very autobiographical. But also moments of extreme catchiness and moments of extreme personal confession.\nDid you do anything wrong from your perspective in dealing with that phone call? Is there anything you regret?\nThe world didn’t understand the context and the events that led up to it. Because nothing ever just happens like that without some lead-up. Some events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a bitch. That was not just a singular event. Basically, I got really sick of the dynamic between he and I. And that wasn’t just based on what happened on that phone call and with that song — it was kind of a chain reaction of things.\nI started to feel like we reconnected, which felt great for me — because all I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me. When someone doesn’t respect you so loudly and says you literally don’t deserve to be here — I just so badly wanted that respect from him, and I hate that about myself, that I was like, “This guy who’s antagonizing me, I just want his approval.” But that’s where I was. And so we’d go to dinner and stuff. And I was so happy, because he would say really nice things about my music. It just felt like I was healing some childhood rejection or something from when I was 19. But the 2015 VMAs come around. He’s getting the Vanguard Award. He called me up beforehand — I didn’t illegally record it, so I can’t play it for you. But he called me up, maybe a week or so before the event, and we had maybe over an hourlong conversation, and he’s like, “I really, really would like for you to present this Vanguard Award to me, this would mean so much to me,” and went into all the reasons why it means so much, because he can be so sweet. He can be the sweetest. And I was so stoked that he asked me that. And so I wrote this speech up, and then we get to the VMAs and I make this speech and he screams, “MTV got Taylor Swift up here to present me this award for ratings!” And I’m standing in the audience with my arm around his wife, and this chill ran through my body. I realized he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk shit. And I was so upset. He wanted me to come talk to him after the event in his dressing room. I wouldn’t go. So then he sent this big, big thing of flowers the next day to apologize. And I was like, “You know what? I really don’t want us to be on bad terms again. So whatever, I’m just going to move past this.” So when he gets on the phone with me, and I was so touched that he would be respectful and, like, tell me about this one line in the song.\nThe line being “. . . me and Taylor might still have sex”?\n And I was like, “OK, good. We’re back on good terms.” And then when I heard the song, I was like, “I’m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let’s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.” And then he literally did the same thing to Drake. He gravely affected the trajectory of Drake’s family and their lives. It’s the same thing. Getting close to you, earning your trust, detonating you. I really don’t want to talk about it anymore because I get worked up, and I don’t want to just talk about negative shit all day, but it’s the same thing. Go watch Drake talk about what happened. \nWhen did you get to the place that’s described on the opening track of Lover, “I Forgot That You Existed”?\nIt was sometime on the Reputation tour, which was the most transformative emotional experience of my career. That tour put me in the healthiest, most balanced place I’ve ever been. After that tour, bad stuff can happen to me, but it doesn’t level me anymore. The stuff that happened a couple of months ago with Scott would have leveled me three years ago and silenced me. I would have been too afraid to speak up. Something about that tour made me disengage from some part of public perception I used to hang my entire identity on, which I now know is incredibly unhealthy.\nWhat was the actual revelation?\nIt’s almost like I feel more clear about the fact that my job is to be an entertainer. It’s not like this massive thing that sometimes my brain makes it into, and sometimes the media makes it into, where we’re all on this battlefield and everyone’s gonna die except one person, who wins. It’s like, “No, do you know what? Katy is going to be legendary. Gaga is going to be legendary. Beyoncé is going to be legendary. Rihanna is going to be legendary. Because the work that they made completely overshadows the myopia of this 24-hour news cycle of clickbait.” And somehow I realized that on tour, as I was looking at people’s faces. We’re just entertaining people, and it’s supposed to be fun.\nIt’s interesting to look at these albums as a trilogy. 1989 was really a reset button.\nOh, in every way. I’ve been very vocal about the fact that that decision was mine and mine alone, and it was definitely met with a lot of resistance. Internally.\nAfter realizing that things were not all smiles with your former label boss, Scott Borchetta, it’s hard not to wonder how much additional conflict there was over things like that.\nA lot of the best things I ever did creatively were things that I had to really fight — and I mean aggressively fight — to have happen. But, you know, I’m not like him, making crazy, petty accusations about the past. . . . When you have a business relationship with someone for 15 years, there are going to be a lot of ups and a lot of downs. But I truly, legitimately thought he looked at me as the daughter he never had. And so even though we had a lot of really bad times and creative differences, I was going to hang my hat on the good stuff. I wanted to be friends with him. I thought I knew what betrayal felt like, but this stuff that happened with him was a redefinition of betrayal for me, just because it felt like it was family. To go from feeling like you’re being looked at as a daughter to this grotesque feeling of “Oh, I was actually his prized calf that he was fattening up to sell to the slaughterhouse that would pay the most.”\nHe accused you of declining the Parkland march and Manchester benefit show.\nUnbelievable. Here’s the thing: Everyone in my team knew if Scooter Braun brings us something, do not bring it to me. The fact that those two are in business together after the things he said about Scooter Braun — it’s really hard to shock me. And this was utterly shocking. These are two very rich, very powerful men, using $300 million of other people’s money to purchase, like, the most feminine body of work. And then they’re standing in a wood-panel bar doing a tacky photo shoot, raising a glass of scotch to themselves. Because they pulled one over on me and got this done so sneakily that I didn’t even see it coming. And I couldn’t say anything about it.\nIn some ways, on a musical level, Lover feels like the most indie-ish of your albums.\nThat’s amazing, thank you. It’s definitely a quirky record. With this album, I felt like I sort of gave myself permission to revisit older themes that I used to write about, maybe look at them with fresh eyes. And to revisit older instruments — older in terms of when I used to use them. Because when I was making 1989, I was so obsessed with it being this concept of Eighties big pop, whether it was Eighties in its production or Eighties in its nature, just having these big choruses — being unapologetically big. And then reputation, there was a reason why I had it all in lowercase. I felt like it wasn’t unapologetically commercial. It’s weird, because that is the album that took the most amount of explanation, and yet it’s the one I didn’t talk about. In the reputation secret sessions I kind of had to explain to my fans, “I know we’re doing a new thing here that I’d never done before.” I’d never played with characters before. For a lot of pop stars, that’s a really fun trick, where they’re like, “This is my alter ego.” I had never played with that before. It’s really fun. And it was just so fun to play with on tour — the darkness and the bombast and the bitterness and the love and the ups and the downs of an emotional-turmoil record.\n“Daylight” is a beautiful song. It feels like it could have been the title track.\nIt almost was. I thought it might be a little bit too sentimental.\nAnd I guess maybe too on-the-nose.\nRight, yeah, way too on-the-nose. That’s what I thought, because I was kind of in my head referring to the album as Daylight for a while. But Lover, to me, was a more interesting title, more of an accurate theme in my head, and more elastic as a concept. That’s why “You Need to Calm Down” can make sense within the theme of the album — one of the things it addresses is how certain people are not allowed to live their lives without discrimination just based on who they love.\nFor the more organic songs on this album, like “Lover” and “Paper Rings,” you said you were imagining a wedding band playing them. How often does that kind of visualization shape a song’s production style?\nSometimes I’ll have a strange sort of fantasy of where the songs would be played. And so for songs like “Paper Rings” or “Lover” I was imagining a wedding-reception band, but in the Seventies, so they couldn’t play instruments that wouldn’t have been invented yet. I have all these visuals. For reputation, it was nighttime cityscape. I didn’t really want any — or very minimal — traditional acoustic instruments. I imagined old warehouse buildings that had been deserted and factory spaces and all this industrial kind of imagery. So I wanted the production to have nothing wooden. There’s no wood floors on that album. Lover is, like, completely just a barn wood floor and some ripped curtains flowing in the breeze, and fields of flowers and, you know, velvet.\nHow did you come to use high school metaphors to touch on politics with “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince”?\nThere are so many influences that go into that particular song. I wrote it a couple of months after midterm elections, and I wanted to take the idea of politics and pick a metaphorical place for that to exist. And so I was thinking about a traditional American high school, where there’s all these kinds of social events that could make someone feel completely alienated. And I think a lot of people in our political landscape are just feeling like we need to huddle up under the bleachers and figure out a plan to make things better.\nI feel like your Fall Out Boy fandom might’ve slipped out in that title.\nI love Fall Out Boy so much. Their songwriting really influenced me, lyrically, maybe more than anyone else. They take a phrase and they twist it. “Loaded God complex/Cock it and pull it”? When I heard that, I was like, “I’m dreaming.”\nYou sing about “American stories burning before me.” Do you mean the illusions of what America is?\nIt’s about the illusions of what I thought America was before our political landscape took this turn, and that naivete that we used to have about it. And it’s also the idea of people who live in America, who just want to live their lives, make a living, have a family, love who they love, and watching those people lose their rights, or watching those people feel not at home in their home. I have that line “I see the high-fives between the bad guys” because not only are some really racist, horrific undertones now becoming overtones in our political climate, but the people who are representing those concepts and that way of looking at the world are celebrating loudly, and it’s horrific.\nYou’re in this weird place of being a blond, blue-eyed pop star in this era — to the point where until you endorsed some Democratic candidates, right-wingers, and worse, assumed you were on their side.\nI don’t think they do anymore. Yeah, that was jarring, and I didn’t hear about that until after it had happened. Because at this point, I, for a very long time, I didn’t have the internet on my phone, and my team and my family were really worried about me because I was not in a good place. And there was a lot of stuff that they just dealt with without telling me about it. Which is the only time that’s ever happened in my career. I’m always in the pilot seat, trying to fly the plane that is my career in exactly the direction I want to take it. But there was a time when I just had to throw my hands up and say, “Guys, I can’t. I can’t do this. I need you to just take over for me and I’m just going to disappear.”\nAre you referring to when a white-supremacist site suggested you were on their team?\nI didn’t even see that, but, like, if that happened, that’s just disgusting. There’s literally nothing worse than white supremacy. It’s repulsive. There should be no place for it. Really, I keep trying to learn as much as I can about politics, and it’s become something I’m now obsessed with, whereas before, I was living in this sort of political ambivalence, because the person I voted for had always won. We were in such an amazing time when Obama was president because foreign nations respected us. We were so excited to have this dignified person in the White House. My first election was voting for him when he made it into office, and then voting to re-elect him. I think a lot of people are like me, where they just didn’t really know that this could happen. But I’m just focused on the 2020 election. I’m really focused on it. I’m really focused on how I can help and not hinder. Because I also don’t want it to backfire again, because I do feel that the celebrity involvement with Hillary’s campaign was used against her in a lot of ways.\nYou took a lot of heat for not getting involved. Does any part of you regret that you just didn’t say “fuck it” and gotten more specific when you said to vote that November?\nTotally. Yeah, I regret a lot of things all the time. It’s like a daily ritual.\nWere you just convinced that it would backfire?\nThat’s literally what it was. Yeah. It’s a very powerful thing when you legitimately feel like numbers have proven that pretty much everyone hates you. Like, quantifiably. That’s not me being dramatic. And you know that.\nThere were a lot of people in those stadiums.\nIt’s true. But that was two years later. . . . I do think, as a party, we need to be more of a team. With Republicans, if you’re wearing that red hat, you’re one of them. And if we’re going to do anything to change what’s happening, we need to stick together. We need to stop dissecting why someone’s on our side or if they’re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly. We need to not have the right kind of Democrat and the wrong kind of Democrat. We need to just be like, “You’re a Democrat? Sick. Get in the car. We’re going to the mall.”\nHere’s a hard question for you: As a superfan, what did you think of the Game of Thrones finale?\nOh, my God. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this. So, clinically our brain responds to our favorite show ending the same way we feel when a breakup occurs. I read that. There’s no good way for it to end. No matter what would have happened in that finale, people still would have been really upset because of the fact that it’s over.\nI was glad to see you confirm that your line about a “list of names” was a reference to Arya.\nI like to be influenced by movies and shows and books and stuff. I love to write about a character dynamic. And not all of my life is going to be as kind of complex as these intricate webs of characters on TV shows and movies.\nThere was a time when it was.\nThat’s amazing.\nBut is the idea that as your own life becomes less dramatic, you’ll need to pull ideas from other places?\nI don’t feel like that yet. I think I might feel like that possibly when I have a family. If I have a family. I don’t know why I said that! But that’s what I’ve heard from other artists, that they were very protective of their personal life, so they had to draw inspiration from other things. But again, I don’t know why I said that. Because I don’t know how my life is going to go or what I’m going to do. But right now, I feel like it’s easier for me to write than it ever was.\nYou don’t talk about your relationship, but you’ll sing about it in wildly revealing detail. What’s the difference for you?\nSinging about something helps you to express it in a way that feels more accurate. You cannot, no matter what, put words in a quote and have it move someone the same way as if you heard those words with the perfect sonic representation of that feeling. . . . There is that weird conflict in being a confessional songwriter and then also having my life, you know, 10 years ago, be catapulted into this strange pop-culture thing.\nI’ve heard you say that people got too interested in which song was about who, which I can understand — at the same time, to be fair, it was a game you played into, wasn’t it?\nI realized very early on that no matter what, that was going to happen to me regardless. So when you realize the rules of the game you’re playing and how it will affect you, you got to look at the board and make your strategy. But at the same time, writing songs has never been a strategic element of my career. But I’m not scared anymore to say that other things in my career, like how to market an album, are strictly strategic. And I’m sick of women not being able to say that they have strategic business minds — because male artists are allowed to. And so I’m sick and tired of having to pretend like I don’t mastermind my own business. But, it’s a different part of my brain than I use to write.\nYou’ve been masterminding your business since you were a teenager.\nYeah, but I’ve also tried very hard — and this is one thing I regret — to convince people that I wasn’t the one holding the puppet strings of my marketing existence, or the fact that I sit in a conference room several times a week and come up with these ideas. I felt for a very long time that people don’t want to think of a woman in music who isn’t just a happy, talented accident. We’re all forced to kind of be like, “Aw, shucks, this happened again! We’re still doing well! Aw, that’s so great.” Alex Morgan celebrating scoring a goal at the World Cup and getting shit for it is a perfect example of why we’re not allowed to flaunt or celebrate, or reveal that, like, “Oh, yeah, it was me. I came up with this stuff.” I think it’s really unfair. People love new female artists so much because they’re able to explain that woman’s success. There’s an easy trajectory. Look at the Game of Thrones finale. I specifically really related to Daenerys’ storyline because for me it portrayed that it is a lot easier for a woman to attain power than to maintain it.\nI mean, she did murder . . .\nIt’s a total metaphor! Like, obviously I didn’t want Daenerys to become that kind of character, but in taking away what I chose to take away from it, I thought maybe they’re trying to portray her climbing the ladder to the top was a lot easier than maintaining it, because for me, the times when I felt like I was going insane was when I was trying to maintain my career in the same way that I ascended. It’s easier to get power than to keep it. It’s easier to get acclaim than to keep it. It’s easier to get attention than to keep it.\nWell, I guess we should be glad you didn’t have a dragon in 2016. . . .\n I told you I don’t like that she did that! But, I mean, watching the show, though, maybe this is a reflection on how we treat women in power, how we are totally going to conspire against them and tear at them until they feel this — this insane shift, where you wonder, like, “What changed?” And I’ve had that happen, like, 60 times in my career where I’m like, “OK, you liked me last year, what changed? I guess I’ll change so I can keep entertaining you guys.”\nYou once said that your mom could never punish you when you were little because you’d punish yourself. This idea of changing in the face of criticism and needing approval — that’s all part of wanting to be good, right? Whatever that means. But that seems to be a real driving force in your life.\nYeah, that’s definitely very perceptive of you. And the question posed to me is, if you kept trying to do good things, but everyone saw those things in a cynical way and assumed them to be done with bad motivation and bad intent, would you still do good things, even though nothing that you did was looked at as good? And the answer is, yes. Criticism that’s constructive is helpful to my character growth. Baseless criticism is stuff I’ve got to toss out now.\nThat sounds healthy. Is this therapy talking or is this just experience?\nNo, I’ve never been to therapy. I talk to my mom a lot, because my mom is the one who’s seen everything. God, it takes so long to download somebody on the last 29 years of my life, and my mom has seen it all. She knows exactly where I’m coming from. And we talk endlessly. There were times when I used to have really, really, really bad days where we would just be on the phone for hours and hours and hours. I’d write something that I wanted to say, and instead of posting it, I’d just read it to her.\nI somehow connect all this to the lyric in “Daylight,” the idea of “so many lines that I’ve crossed unforgiven” — it’s a different kind of confession.\nI am really glad you liked that line, because that’s something that does bother me, looking back at life and realizing that no matter what, you screw things up. Sometimes there are people that were in your life and they’re not anymore — and there’s nothing you can do about it. You can’t fix it, you can’t change it. I told the fans last night that sometimes on my bad days, I feel like my life is a pile of crap accumulated of only the bad headlines or the bad things that have happened, or the mistakes I’ve made or clichés or rumors or things that people think about me or have thought for the last 15 years. And that was part of the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video, where I had a pile of literal old selves fighting each other.\nBut, yeah, that line is indicative of my anxiety about how in life you can’t get everything right. A lot of times you make the wrong call, make the wrong decision. Say the wrong thing. Hurt people, even if you didn’t mean to. You don’t really know how to fix all of that. When it’s, like, 29 years’ worth.\nTo be Mr. “Rolling Stone” for a second, there’s a Springsteen lyric, “Ain’t no one leaving this world, buddy/Without their shirttail dirty or hands a little bloody.”\nThat’s really good! No one gets through it unscathed. No one gets through in one piece. I think that’s a hard thing for a lot of people to grasp. I know it was hard for me, because I kind of grew up thinking, “If I’m nice, and if I try to do the right thing, you know, maybe I can just, like, ace this whole thing.” And it turns out I can’t.\nIt’s interesting to look at “I Did Something Bad” in this context.\nYou pointing that out is really interesting because it’s something I’ve had to reconcile within myself in the last couple of years — that sort of “good” complex. Because from the time I was a kid I’d try to be kind, be a good person. Try really hard. But you get walked all over sometimes. And how do you respond to being walked all over? You can’t just sit there and eat your salad and let it happen. “I Did Something Bad” was about doing something that was so against what I would usually do. Katy and I were talking about our signs. . . .  Of course we were.\nThat’s the greatest sentence ever.\n I hate you. We were talking about our signs because we had this really, really long talk when we were reconnecting and stuff. And I remember in the long talk, she was like, “If we had one glass of white wine right now, we’d both be crying.” Because we were drinking tea. We’ve had some really good conversations.\nWe were talking about how we’ve had miscommunications with people in the past, not even specifically with each other. She’s like, “I’m a Scorpio. Scorpios just strike when they feel threatened.” And I was like, “Well, I’m an archer. We literally stand back, assess the situation, process how we feel about it, raise a bow, pull it back, and fire.” So it’s completely different ways of processing pain, confusion, misconception. And oftentimes I’ve had this delay in feeling something that hurts me and then saying that it hurts me. Do you know what I mean? And so I can understand how people in my life would have been like, “Whoa, I didn’t know that was how you felt.” Because it takes me a second.\nIf you watch the video of the 2009 VMAs, I literally freeze. I literally stand there. And that is how I handle any discomfort, any pain. I stand there, I freeze. And then five minutes later, I know how I feel. But in the moment, I’m probably overreacting and I should be nice. Then I process it, and in five minutes, if it’s gone, it’s past, and I’m like, “I was overreacting, everything’s fine. I can get through this. I’m glad I didn’t say anything harsh in the moment.” But when it’s actually something bad that happened, and I feel really, really hurt or upset about it, I only know after the fact. Because I’ve tried so hard to squash it: “This probably isn’t what you think.” That’s something I had to work on.\nYou could end up gaslighting yourself.\nYeah, for sure. ’Cause so many situations where if I would have said the first thing that came to my mind, people would have been like, “Whoa!” And maybe I would have been wrong or combative. So a couple of years ago I started working on actually just responding to my emotions in a quicker fashion. And it’s really helped with stuff. It’s helped so much because sometimes you get in arguments. But conflict in the moment is so much better than combat after the fact.\nWell, thanks.\nI do feel like I just did a therapy session. As someone who’s never been to therapy, I can safely say that was the best therapy session.", "There I was again tonight\nForcing laughter, faking smiles\nSame old tired, lonely place\nWalls of

Swift, who TIME recognized as one of the Silence Breakers who inspired women to speak out about harassment in this year’s Person of the Year issue, granted TIME her first interview since the trial.\nIn 2013, the singer-songwriter took a photo with a Colorado radio DJ after an interview. During that photo, Swift says, DJ David Mueller reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end. Swift privately reported the incident to the station at which Mueller worked, and he was fired. Mueller then sued Swift for defamation; she countersued for a symbolic $1—and won.\nSwift refused to be bullied on the stand. Her straightforward testimony was lauded by many for its fierceness. When asked why the pictures taken during the assault didn’t show the front of her skirt wrinkled as evidence of any wrongdoing, she said simply, “Because my ass is located at the back of my body.” When asked if she felt guilty about Mueller losing his job, she said, “I’m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions—not mine.”\nLike many of the women interviewed for the 2017 Person of the Year issue, Swift would not accept blame for the abuse she experienced. Her clear-eyed testimony marked one of several major milestones in the conversation around sexual harassment this year. Swift responded to questions about her experience from TIME in writing.\nWhy was it important for you to come forward about what happened to you?\nIn 2013, I met a DJ from a prominent country radio station in one of my pre-show meet and greets. When we were posing for the photo, he stuck his hand up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek. I squirmed and lurched sideways to get away from him, but he wouldn’t let go. At the time, I was headlining a major arena tour and there were a number of people in the room that saw this plus a photo of it happening. I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance. It was important to report the incident to his radio station because I felt like they needed to know. The radio station conducted its own investigation and fired him. Two years later, he sued me.\nHow did you feel when you testified?\nWhen I testified, I had already been in court all week and had to watch this man’s attorney bully, badger and harass my team including my mother over inane details and ridiculous minutiae, accusing them, and me, of lying. My mom was so upset after her cross-examination, she was physically too ill to come to court the day I was on the stand. I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn’t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn’t hold back on my mom—why should I be polite? I’m told it was the most amount of times the word “ass” has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.\nHow have people responded to your story?\nPeople have been largely very supportive of my story since the trial began in August, but before that, I spent two years reading headlines referring to it as “The Taylor Swift Butt Grab Case” with internet trolls making a joke about what happened to me. The details were all skewed, as they often are. Most people thought I was suing him. There was an audible gasp in the courtroom when I was named as the defendant. Once it hit the news that I was in Denver dealing with this, there was an outpouring of support on social media and I have never appreciated it more. I spoke to Kesha on the phone and it really helped to talk to someone who had been through the demoralizing court process.\nAfter this experience, what advice would you give to your fans?\nI would tell people who find themselves in this situation that there is a great deal of blame placed on the victims in cases of sexual harassment and assault. You could be blamed for the fact that it happened, for reporting it and blamed for how you reacted. You might be made to feel like you’re overreacting, because society has made this stuff seem so casual. My advice is that you not blame yourself and do not accept the blame others will try to place on you. You should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes or 15 days or 15 years to report sexual assault or harassment, or for the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you.\nIs this a watershed moment for the way we think about sexual assault and harassment in culture?\nI think that this moment is important for awareness, for how parents are talking to their children, and how victims are processing their trauma, whether it be new or old. The brave women and men who have come forward this year have all moved the needle in terms of letting people know that this abuse of power shouldn’t be tolerated. Going to court to confront this type of behavior is a lonely and draining experience, even when you win, even when you have the financial ability to defend yourself. Even though awareness is higher than ever about workplace sexual harassment, there are still so many people who feel victimized, afraid and silenced by their abusers and circumstances. When the jury found in my favor, the man who sexually assaulted me was court-ordered to give me a symbolic $1. To this day he has not paid me that dollar, and I think that act of defiance is symbolic in itself.", "Thank you, thank you. Oh, thank you so much.

"I’ve been a Taylor Swift fan for as long as I can remember. But it wasn’t until I met and got to know her that I understood how wonderful a person she truly is.\nTaylor makes the job of creating music for millions of people look easy. It all comes from her—her belief in magic and love, and her ability to be as honest and raw as possible. She’s the master of putting the perfect amount of thought into not overthinking, and that’s why her music connects so well.\nI was so lucky to be able to open for a handful of her stadium shows on the 1989 World Tour. And I quickly learned that the magic of Taylor Swift doesn’t come from the lights, dancers or fireworks but from the electrifying connection that she has with the people who are there to see her. There’s an overwhelming feeling in the air. The feeling of your heart racing in your chest with ­excitement—so much so that by the time you get to “Love Story,” all you want to do is pick up your phone and text every person you know to say how much you love them. The feeling is so thick, you feel like you could reach out and grab it to keep forever.\nTaylor makes anyone older feel young again and anyone young feel they can do anything. It’s so rare and so special. If there is one thing I want to achieve in my career and life, it’s that.", "My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in\nEveryone looked worse in the light\nThere are so many lines that Ive crossed unforgiven\nIll tell you truth, but never goodbye\nI dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\nI dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\nIve been sleepin so long in a 20 year dark night\nAnd now I see daylight, I only see daylight\nLuck of the draw only draws the unlucky\nAnd so I became the butt of the joke\nI wounded the good and I trusted the wicked\nClearin the air, I breathed in the smoke\nMaybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down\nMaybe Ive stormed out of every single room in this town\nThrew out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now\nIts brighter now, now\nI dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\nI dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\nIve been sleepin so long in a 20 year dark night\nAnd now I see daylight\nI only see daylight\nI only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight\nI only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight\nAnd I can still see it all \nAll of you, all of me \nI once believed love would be \nBut its golden \nAnd I can still see it all \nBack and forth from New York \nI once believed love would be \nBut its golden\nLike daylight\nLike daylight\nLike daylight\nDaylight\nI dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you\nI dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you\nIve been sleepin so long in a 20 year dark night\nAnd now I see daylight\nI only see daylight\nI only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight\nI only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight\nI only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight\nI only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight\nLike daylight\nIts golden\nLike daylight\nYou gotta step into the daylight and let it go\nJust let it go\nLet it go", "Taylor Swift arrived early to Paul McCartney’s London office in October, “mask on, brimming with excitement.” “I mostly work from home these days,” she writes about that day, “and today feels like a rare school field trip that you actually want to go on.”\nSwift showed up without a team, doing her own hair and makeup. In addition to being two of the most famous pop songwriters in the world, Swift and McCartney have spent the past year on similar journeys. McCartney, isolated at home in the U.K., recorded McCartney III. Like his first solo album, in 1970, he played nearly all of the instruments himself, resulting in some of his most wildly ambitious songs in a long time. Swift also took some new chances, writing over email with the National’s Aaron Dessner and recording the raw folklore, which abandons arena pop entirely in favor of rich character songs. It’s the bestselling album of 2020.\nSwift listened to McCartney III as she prepared for today’s conversation; McCartney delved into folkore. Before the photo shoot, Swift caught up with his daughters Mary and Stella . “I’ve met Paul a few times, mostly onstage at parties, but we’ll get to that later,” Swift writes. “Soon he walks in with his wife, Nancy. They’re a sunny and playful pair, and I immediately feel like this will be a good day. During the shoot, Paul dances and takes almost none of it too seriously and sings along to Motown songs playing from the speakers. A few times Mary scolds, ‘Daaad, try to stand still!’ And it feels like a window into a pretty awesome family dynamic. We walk into his office for a chat, and after I make a nervous request, Paul is kind enough to handwrite my favorite lyric of his and sign it. He makes a joke about me selling it, and I laugh because it’s something I know I’ll cherish for the rest of my life. That’s around the time when we start talking about music.”\nTaylor Swift: I think it’s important to note that if this year had gone the way that we thought it was going to go, you and I would have played Glastonbury this year, and instead, you and I both made albums in isolation.\nPaul McCartney: Yeah!\nSwift: And I remember thinking it would have been so much fun because the times that I’ve run into you, I correlate with being some of the most fun nights of my life. I was at a party with you, when everybody just started playing music. And it was Dave Grohl playing, and you…\nMcCartney: You were playing one of his songs, weren’t you?\nSwift: Yes, I was playing his song called “Best of You,” but I was playing it on piano, and he didn’t recognize it until about halfway through. I just remember thinking, “Are you the catalyst for the most fun times ever?” Is it your willingness to get up and play music that makes everyone feel like this is a thing that can happen tonight?\nMcCartney: I mean, I think it’s a bit of everything, isn’t it? I’ll tell you who was very … Reese Witherspoon was like, “Are you going to sing?” I said “Oh, I don’t know.” She said, “You’ve got to, yeah!” She’s bossing me around. So I said, “Whoa,” so it’s a bit of that.\nSwift: I love that person, because the party does not turn musical without that person.\nMcCartney: Yeah, that’s true.\nSwift: If nobody says, “Can you guys play music?” we’re not going to invite ourselves up onstage at whatever living-room party it is.\nMcCartney: I seem to remember Woody Harrelson got on the piano, and he starts playing “Let It Be,” and I’m thinking, “I can do that better.” So I said, “Come on, move over, Woody.” So we’re both playing it. It was really nice.… I love people like Dan Aykroyd, who’s just full of energy and he loves his music so much, but he’s not necessarily a musician, but he just wanders around the room, just saying, “You got to get up, got to get up, do some stuff.”\nSwift: I listened to your new record. And I loved a lot of things about it, but it really did feel like kind of a flex to write, produce, and play every instrument on every track. To me, that’s like flexing a muscle and saying, “I can do all this on my own if I have to.”\nMcCartney: Well, I don’t think like that, I must admit. I just picked up some of these instruments over the years. We had a piano at home that my dad played, so I picked around on that. I wrote the melody to “When I’m 64” when I was, you know, a teenager.\nSwift: Wow.\nMcCartney: When the Beatles went to Hamburg, there were always drum kits knocking around, so when there was a quiet moment, I’d say, “Do you mind if I have a knock around?” So I was able to practice, you know, without practicing. That’s why I play right-handed. Guitar was just the first instrument I got. Guitar turned to bass; it also turned into ukulele, mandolin. Suddenly, it’s like, “Wow,” but it’s really only two or three instruments.\nSwift: Well, I think that’s downplaying it a little bit. In my mind, it came with a visual of you being in the country, kind of absorbing the sort of do-it-yourself that has had to come with the quarantine and this pandemic. I found that I’ve adapted a do-it-yourself mentality to a lot of things in my career that I used to outsource. I’m just wondering what a day of recording in the pandemic looked like for you.\nMcCartney: Well, I’m very lucky because I have a studio that’s, like, 20 minutes away from where I live. We were in lockdown on a farm, a sheep farm with my daughter Mary and her four kids and her husband. So I had four of my grandkids, I had Mary, who’s a great cook, so I would just drive myself to the studio. And there were two other guys that could come in and we’d be very careful and distanced and everything: my engineer Steve, and then my equipment guy Keith. So the three of us made the record, and I just started off. I had to do a little bit of film music — I had to do an instrumental for a film thing — so I did that. And I just kept going, and that turned into the opening track on the album. I would just come in, say, “Oh, yeah, what are we gonna do?” have some sort of idea, and start doing it. Normally, I’d start with the instrument I wrote it on, either piano or guitar, and then probably add some drums and then a bit of bass till it started to sound like a record, and then just gradually layer it all up. It was fun. What about yours? You’re playing guitar and piano on yours.\nSwift: Yeah, on some of it, but a lot of it was made with Aaron Dessner, who’s in a band called the National that I really love. And I had met him at a concert a year before, and I had a conversation with him, asking him how he writes. It’s my favorite thing to ask people who I’m a fan of. And he had an interesting answer. He said, “All the band members live in different parts of the world. So I make tracks. And I send them to our lead singer, Matt, and he writes the top line.” I just remember thinking, “That is really efficient.” And I kind of stored it in my brain as a future idea for a project. You know, how you have these ideas… “Maybe one day I’ll do this.” I always had in my head: “Maybe one day I’ll work with Aaron Dessner.”\nSo when lockdown happened, I was in L.A., and we kind of got stuck there. It’s not a terrible place to be stuck. We were there for four months maybe, and during that time, I sent an email to Aaron Dessner and I said, “Do you think you would want to work during this time? Because my brain is all scrambled, and I need to make something, even if we’re just kind of making songs that we don’t know what will happen…”\nMcCartney: Yeah, that was the thing. You could do stuff — you didn’t really worry it was going to turn into anything.\nSwift: Yeah, and it turned out he had been writing instrumental tracks to keep from absolutely going crazy during the pandemic as well, so he sends me this file of probably 30 instrumentals, and the first one I opened ended up being a song called “Cardigan,” and it really happened rapid-fire like that. He’d send me a track; he’d make new tracks, add to the folder; I would write the entire top line for a song, and he wouldn’t know what the song would be about, what it was going to be called, where I was going to put the chorus. I had originally thought, “Maybe I’ll make an album in the next year, and put it out in January or something,” but it ended up being done and we put it out in July. And I just thought there are no rules anymore, because I used to put all these parameters on myself, like, “How will this song sound in a stadium? How will this song sound on radio?” If you take away all the parameters, what do you make? And I guess the answer is folklore.\nMcCartney: And it’s more music for yourself than music that’s got to go do a job. My thing was similar to that: After having done this little bit of film music, I had a lot of stuff that I had been working on, but I’d said, “I’m just going home now,” and it’d be left half-finished. So I just started saying, “Well, what about that? I never finished that.” So we’d pull it out, and we said, “Oh, well, this could be good.” And because it didn’t have to amount to anything, I would say, “Ah, I really want to do tape loops. I don’t care if they fit on this song, I just want to do some.” So I go and make some tape loops, and put them in the song, just really trying to do stuff that I fancy.\nI had no idea it would end up as an album; I may have been a bit less indulgent, but if a track was eight minutes long, to tell you the truth, what I thought was, “I’ll be taking it home tonight, Mary will be cooking, the grandkids will all be there running around, and someone, maybe Simon, Mary’s husband, is going to say, ‘What did you do today?’ And I’m going to go, ‘Oh,’ and then get my phone and play it for them.” So this became the ritual.\nSwift: That’s the coziest thing I’ve ever heard.\nMcCartney: Well, it’s like eight minutes long, and I said, “I hate it when I’m playing someone something and it finishes after three minutes.” I kind of like that it just on.\nSwift: You want to stay in the zone.\nMcCartney: It just keeps going on. I would just come home, “Well, what did you do today?” “Oh, well, I did this. I’m halfway through this,” or, “We finished this.”\nSwift: I was wondering about the numerology element to McCartney III. McCartney I, II, and III have all come out on years with zeroes.\nMcCartney: Ends of decades.\nSwift: Was that important?\nMcCartney: Yeah, well, this was being done in 2020, and I didn’t really think about it. I think everyone expected great things of 2020. “It’s gonna be great! Look at that number! 2020! Auspicious!” Then suddenly Covid hit, and it was like, “That’s gonna be auspicious all right, but maybe for the wrong reasons.” Someone said to me, “Well, you put out McCartney right after the Beatles broke up, and that was 1970, and then you did McCartney II in 1980.” And I said, “Oh, I’m going to release this in 2020 just for whatever you call it, the numerology.…”\nSwift: The numerology, the kind of look, the symbolism. I love numbers. Numbers kind of rule my whole world. The numbers 13  … 89 is a big one. I have a few others that I find…\nMcCartney: Thirteen is lucky for some.\nSwift: Yeah, it’s lucky for me. It’s my birthday. It’s all these weird coincidences of good things that have happened. Now, when I see it places, I look at it as a sign that things are going the way they’re supposed to. They may not be good now, they could be painful now, but things are on a track. I don’t know, I love the numerology.\nMcCartney: It’s spooky, Taylor. It’s very spooky. Now wait a minute: Where’d you get 89?\nSwift: That’s when I was born, in 1989, and so I see it in different places and I just think it’s…\nMcCartney: No, it’s good. I like that, where certain things you attach yourself to, and you get a good feeling off them. I think that’s great.\nSwift: Yeah, one of my favorite artists, Bon Iver, he has this thing with the number 22. But I was also wondering: You have always kind of seeked out a band or a communal atmosphere with like, you know, the Beatles and Wings, and then Egypt Station. I thought it was interesting when I realized you had made a record with no one else. I just wondered, did that feel natural?\nMcCartney: It’s one of the things I’ve done. Like with McCartney, because the Beatles had broken up, there was no alternative but to get a drum kit at home, get a guitar, get an amp, get a bass, and just make something for myself. So on that album, which I didn’t really expect to do very well, I don’t think it did. But people sort of say, “I like that. It was a very casual album.” It didn’t really have to mean anything. So I’ve done that, the play-everything-myself thing. And then I discovered synths and stuff, and sequencers, so I had a few of those at home. I just thought I’m going to play around with this and record it, so that became McCartney II. But it’s a thing I do. Certain people can do it. Stevie Wonder can do it. Stevie Winwood, I believe, has done it. So there are certain people quite like that.\nWhen you’re working with someone else, you have to worry about their variances. Whereas your own variance, you kind of know it. It’s just something I’ve grown to like. Once you can do it, it becomes a little bit addictive. I actually made some records under the name the Fireman.\nSwift: Love a pseudonym.\nMcCartney: Yeah, for the fun! But, you know, let’s face it, you crave fame and attention when you’re young. And I just remembered the other day, I was the guy in the Beatles that would write to journalists and say : “We are a semiprofessional rock combo, and I’d think you’d like .… We’ve written over 100 songs , my friend John and I. If you mention us in your newspaper…” You know, I was always, like, craving the attention.\nSwift: The hustle! That’s so great, though.\nMcCartney: Well, yeah, you need that.\nSwift: Yeah, I think, when a pseudonym comes in is when you still have a love for making the work and you don’t want the work to become overshadowed by this thing that’s been built around you, based on what people know about you. And that’s when it’s really fun to create fake names and write under them.\nMcCartney: Do you ever do that?\nSwift: Oh, yeah.\nMcCartney: Oh, yeah? Oh, well, we didn’t know that! Is that a widely known fact?\nSwift: I think it is now, but it wasn’t. I wrote under the name Nils Sjöberg because those are two of the most popular names of Swedish males. I wrote this song called “This Is What You Came For” that Rihanna ended up singing. And nobody knew for a while. I remembered always hearing that when Prince wrote “Manic Monday,” they didn’t reveal it for a couple of months.\nMcCartney: Yeah, it also proves you can do something without the fame tag. I did something for Peter and Gordon; my girlfriend’s brother and his mate were in a band called Peter and Gordon. And I used to write under the name Bernard Webb.\nSwift: That’s a good one! I love it.\nMcCartney: As Americans call it, Ber-nard Webb. I did the Fireman thing. I worked with a producer, a guy called Youth, who’s this real cool dude. We got along great. He did a mix for me early on, and we got friendly. I would just go into the studio, and he would say, “Hey, what about this groove?” and he’d just made me have a little groove going. He’d say, “You ought to put some bass on it. Put some drums on it.” I’d just spend the whole day putting stuff on it. And we’d make these tracks, and nobody knew who Fireman was for a while. We must have sold all of 15 copies.\nSwift: Thrilling, absolutely thrilling.\nMcCartney: And we didn’t mind, you know?\nSwift: I think it’s so cool that you do projects that are just for you. Because I went with my family to see you in concert in 2010 or 2011, and the thing I took away from the show most was that it was the most selfless set list I had ever seen. It was completely geared toward what it would thrill us to hear. It had new stuff, but it had every hit we wanted to hear, every song we’d ever cried to, every song people had gotten married to, or been brokenhearted to. And I just remembered thinking, “I’ve got to remember that,” that you do that set list for your fans.\nMcCartney: You do that, do you?\nSwift: I do now. I think that learning that lesson from you taught me at a really important stage in my career that if people want to hear “Love Story” and “Shake It Off,” and I’ve played them 300 million times, play them the 300-millionth-and-first time. I think there are times to be selfish in your career, and times to be selfless, and sometimes they line up.\nMcCartney: I always remembered going to concerts as a kid, completely before the Beatles, and I really hoped they would play the ones I loved. And if they didn’t, it was kind of disappointing. I had no money, and the family wasn’t wealthy. So this would be a big deal for me, to save up for months to afford the concert ticket.\nSwift: Yeah, it feels like a bond. It feels like that person on the stage has given something, and it makes you as a crowd want to give even more back, in terms of applause, in terms of dedication. And I just remembered feeling that bond in the crowd, and thinking, “He’s up there playing these Beatles songs, my dad is crying, my mom is trying to figure out how to work her phone because her hands are shaking so much.” Because seeing the excitement course through not only me, but my family and the entire crowd in Nashville, it just was really special. I love learning lessons and not having to learn them the hard way. Like learning nice lessons I really value.\nMcCartney: Well, that’s great, and I’m glad that set you on that path. I understand people who don’t want to do that, and if you do, they’ll say, “Oh, it’s a jukebox show.” I hear what they’re saying. But I think it’s a bit of a cheat, because the people who come to our shows have spent a lot of money. We can afford to go to a couple of shows and it doesn’t make much difference. But a lot of ordinary working folks … it’s a big event in their life, and so I try and deliver. I also, like you say, try and put in a few weirdos.\nSwift: That’s the best. I want to hear current things, too, to update me on where the artist is. I was wondering about lyrics, and where you were lyrically when you were making this record. Because when I was making folklore, I went lyrically in a total direction of escapism and romanticism. And I wrote songs imagining I was, like, a pioneer woman in a forbidden love affair . I was completely …\nMcCartney: Was this “I want to give you a child”? Is that one of the lines?\nSwift: Oh, that’s a song called “Peace.”\nMcCartney: “Peace,” I like that one.\nSwift: “Peace” is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.\nMcCartney: So how does that go? Does your partner sympathize with that and understand?\nSwift: Oh, absolutely.\nMcCartney: They have to, don’t they?\nSwift: But I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids. Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture — the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That’s what that song “Peace” is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave? Stella always tells me that she had as normal a childhood as she could ever hope for under the circumstances.\nMcCartney: Yeah, it was very important to us to try and keep their feet on the ground amongst the craziness.\nSwift: She went to a regular school .…\nMcCartney: Yeah, she did.\nSwift: And you would go trick-or-treating with them, wearing masks.\nMcCartney: All of them did, yeah. It was important, but it worked pretty well, because when they kind of reached adulthood, they would meet other kids who might have gone to private schools, who were a little less grounded.\nAnd they could be the budding mothers to . I remember Mary had a friend, Orlando. Not Bloom. She used to really counsel him. And it’s ’cause she’d gone through that. Obviously, they got made fun of, my kids. They’d come in the classroom and somebody would sing, “Na na na na,” you know, one of the songs. And they’d have to handle that. They’d have to front it out.\nSwift: Did that give you a lot of anxiety when you had kids, when you felt like all this pressure that’s been put on me is spilling over onto them, that they didn’t sign up for it? Was that hard for you?\nMcCartney: Yeah, a little bit, but it wasn’t like it is now. You know, we were just living a kind of semi-hippie life, where we withdrew from a lot of stuff. The kids would be doing all the ordinary things, and their school friends would be coming up to the house and having parties, and it was just great. I remember one lovely evening when it was Stella’s birthday, and she brought a bunch of school kids up. And, you know, they’d all ignore me. It happens very quickly. At first they’re like, “Oh, yeah, he’s like a famous guy,” and then it’s like . I like that. I go in the other room and suddenly I hear this music going on. And one of the kids, his name was Luke, and he’s doing break dancing.\nSwift: Ohhh!\nMcCartney: He was a really good break dancer, so all the kids are hanging out. That allowed them to be kind of normal with those kids. The other thing is, I don’t live fancy. I really don’t. Sometimes it’s a little bit of an embarrassment, if I’ve got someone coming to visit me, or who I know…\nSwift: Cares about that stuff?\nMcCartney: Who’s got a nice big house, you know. Quincy Jones came to see me and I’m, like, making him a veggie burger or something. I’m doing some cooking. This was after I’d lost Linda, in between there. But the point I’m making is that I’m very consciously thinking, “Oh, God, Quincy’s got to be thinking, ‘What is this guy on? He hasn’t got big things going on. It’s not a fancy house at all. And we’re eating in the kitchen! He’s not even got the dining room going,’” you know?\nSwift: I think that sounds like a perfect day.\nMcCartney: But that’s me. I’m awkward like that. That’s my kind of thing. Maybe I should have, like, a big stately home. Maybe I should get a staff. But I think I couldn’t do that. I’d be so embarrassed. I’d want to walk around dressed as I want to walk around, or naked, if I wanted to.\nSwift: That can’t happen in Downton Abbey.\nMcCartney: Exactly.\nSwift: I remember what I wanted to know about, which is lyrics. Like, when you’re in this kind of strange, unparalleled time, and you’re making this record, are lyrics first? Or is it when you get a little melodic idea?\nMcCartney: It was a bit of both. As it kind of always is with me. There’s no fixed way. People used to ask me and John, “Well, who does the words, who does the music?” I used to say, “We both do both.” We used to say we don’t have a formula, and we don’t want one. Because the minute we get a formula, we should rip it up. I will sometimes, as I did with a couple of songs on this album, sit down at the piano and just start noodling around, and I’ll get a little idea and start to fill that out. So the lyrics — for me, it’s following a trail. I’ll start : “I can find my way. I know my left from right, da da da.” And I’ll just sort of fill it in. Like, we know this song, and I’m trying to remember the lyrics. Sometimes I’ll just be inspired by something. I had a little book which was all about the constellations and the stars and the orbits of Venus and.…\nSwift: Oh, I know that song — “The Kiss of Venus”?\nMcCartney: Yeah, “The Kiss of Venus.” And I just thought, “That’s a nice phrase.” So I was actually just taking phrases out of the book, harmonic sounds. And the book is talking about the maths of the universe, and how when things orbit around each other, and if you trace all the patterns, it becomes like a lotus flower.\nSwift: Wow.\nMcCartney: It’s very magical.\nSwift: That is magical. I definitely relate to needing to find magical things in this very not-magical time, needing to read more books and learn to sew, and watch movies that take place hundreds of years ago. In a time where, if you look at the news, you just want to have a panic attack — I really relate to the idea that you are thinking about stars and constellations.\nMcCartney: Did you do that on folklore?\nSwift: Yes. I was reading so much more than I ever did, and watching so many more films.\nMcCartney: What stuff were you reading?\nSwift: I was reading, you know, books like Rebecca, by Daphne du Maurier, which I highly recommend, and books that dealt with times past, a world that doesn’t exist anymore. I was also using words I always wanted to use — kind of bigger, flowerier, prettier words, like “epiphany,” in songs. I always thought, “Well, that’ll never track on pop radio,” but when I was making this record, I thought, “What tracks? Nothing makes sense anymore. If there’s chaos everywhere, why don’t I just use the damn word I want to use in the song?”\nMcCartney: Exactly. So you’d see the word in a book and think, “I love that word”?\nSwift: Yeah, I have favorite words, like “elegies” and “epiphany” and “divorcée,” and just words that I think sound beautiful, and I have lists and lists of them.\nMcCartney: How about “marzipan”?\nSwift: Love marzipan.\nMcCartney: The other day, I was remembering when we wrote “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”: “kaleidoscope.”\nSwift: “Kaleidoscope” is one of mine! I have a song on 1989, a song called “Welcome to New York,” that I put the word “kaleidoscope” in just because I’m obsessed with the word.\nMcCartney: I think a love of words is a great thing, particularly if you’re going to try to write a lyric, and for me, it’s like, “What is this going to say to that person?” I often feel like I’m writing to someone who is not doing so well. So I’m trying to write songs that might help. Not in a goody-goody, crusading kind of way, but just thinking there have been so many times in my life when I’ve heard a song and felt so much better. I think that’s the angle I want, that inspirational thing.\nI remember once, a friend of mine from Liverpool, we were teenagers and we were going to a fairground. He was a schoolmate, and we had these jackets that had a little fleck in the material, which was the cool thing at the time.\nSwift: We should have done matching jackets for this photo shoot.\nMcCartney: Find me a fleck, I’m in. But we went to the fair, and I just remember — this is what happens with songs — there was this girl at the fair. This is just a little Liverpool fair — it was in a place called Sefton Park — and there was this girl, who was so beautiful. She wasn’t a star. She was so beautiful. Everyone was following her, and it’s like, “Wow.” It’s like a magical scene, you know? But all this gave me a headache, so I ended up going back to his house — I didn’t normally get headaches. And we thought, “What can we do?” So we put on the Elvis song “All Shook Up.” By the end of that song, my headache had gone. I thought, you know, “That’s powerful.”\nSwift: That really is powerful.\nMcCartney: I love that, when people stop me in the street and say, “Oh, I was going through an illness and I listened to a lot of your stuff, and I’m better now and it got me through,” or kids will say, “It got me through exams.” You know, they’re studying, they’re going crazy, but they put your music on. I’m sure it happens with a lot of your fans. It inspires them, you know?\nSwift: Yeah, I definitely think about that as a goal. There’s so much stress everywhere you turn that I kind of wanted to make an album that felt sort of like a hug, or like your favorite sweater that makes you feel like you want to put it on.\nMcCartney: What, a “cardigan”?\nSwift: Like a good cardigan, a good, worn-in cardigan. Or something that makes you reminisce on your childhood. I think sadness can be cozy. It can obviously be traumatic and stressful, too, but I kind of was trying to lean into sadness that feels like somehow enveloping in not such a scary way — like nostalgia and whimsy incorporated into a feeling like you’re not all right. Because I don’t think anybody was really feeling like they were in their prime this year. Isolation can mean escaping into your imagination in a way that’s kind of nice.\nMcCartney: I think a lot of people have found that. I would say to people, “I feel a bit guilty about saying I’m actually enjoying this quarantine thing,” and people go, “Yeah, I know, don’t say it to anyone.” A lot of people are really suffering.\nSwift: Because there’s a lot in life that’s arbitrary. Completely and totally arbitrary. And is really shining a light on that, and also a lot of things we have that we outsource that you can actually do yourself.\nMcCartney: I love that. This is why I said I live simply. That’s, like, at the core of it. With so many things, something goes wrong and you go, “Oh, I’ll get somebody to fix that.” And then it’s like, “No, let me have a look at it.…”\nSwift: Get a hammer and a nail.\nMcCartney: “Maybe I can put that picture up.” It’s not rocket science. The period after the Beatles, when we went to live in Scotland on a really — talk about dumpy — little farm. I mean, I see pictures of it now and I’m not ashamed, but I’m almost ashamed. Because it’s like, “God, nobody’s cleaned up around here.”\nBut it was really a relief. Because when I was with the Beatles, we’d formed Apple Records, and if I wanted a Christmas tree, someone would just buy it. And I thought, after a while, “No, you know what? I really would like to go and buy our Christmas tree. Because that’s what everyone does.” So you go down — “I’ll have that one” — and you carried it back. I mean, it’s little, but it’s huge at the same time.\nI needed a table in Scotland and I was looking through a catalog and I thought, “I could make one. I did woodwork in school, so I know what a dovetail joint is.” So I just figured it out. I’m just sitting in the kitchen, and I’m whittling away at this wood and I made this little joint. There was no nail technology — it was glue. And I was scared to put it together. I said, “It’s not going to fit,” but one day, I got my woodwork glue and thought, “There’s no going back.” But it turned out to be a real nice little table I was very proud of. It was that sense of achievement.\nThe weird thing was, Stella went up to Scotland recently and I said, “Isn’t it there?” and she said, “No.” Anyway, I searched for it. Nobody remembered it. Somebody said, “Well, there’s a pile of wood in the corner of one of the barns, maybe that’s it. Maybe they used it for firewood.” I said, “No, it’s not firewood.” Anyway, we found it, and do you know how joyous that was for me? I was like, “You found my table?!” Somebody might say that’s a bit boring.\nSwift: No, it’s cool!\nMcCartney: But it was a real sort of great thing for me to be able to do stuff for yourself. You were talking about sewing. I mean normally, in your position, you’ve got any amount of tailors.\nSwift: Well, there’s been a bit of a baby boom recently; several of my friends have gotten pregnant.\nMcCartney: Oh, yeah, you’re at the age.\nSwift: And I was just thinking, “I really want to spend time with my hands, making something for their children.” So I made this really cool flying-squirrel stuffed animal that I sent to one of my friends. I sent a teddy bear to another one, and I started making these little silk baby blankets with embroidery. It’s gotten pretty fancy. And I’ve been painting a lot.\nMcCartney: What do you paint? Watercolors?\nSwift: Acrylic or oil. Whenever I do watercolor, all I paint is flowers. When I have oil, I really like to do landscapes. I always kind of return to painting a lonely little cottage on a hill.\nMcCartney: It’s a bit of a romantic dream. I agree with you, though, I think you’ve got to have dreams, particularly this year. You’ve got to have something to escape to. When you say “escapism,” it sounds like a dirty word, but this year, it definitely wasn’t. And in the books you’re reading, you’ve gone into that world. That’s, I think, a great thing. Then you come back out. I normally will read a lot before I go to bed. So I’ll come back out, then I’ll go to sleep, so I think it really is nice to have those dreams that can be fantasies or stuff you want to achieve.\nSwift: You’re creating characters. This was the first album where I ever created characters, or wrote about the life of a real-life person. There’s a song called “the last great american dynasty” that’s about this real-life heiress who lived just an absolutely chaotic, hectic…\nMcCartney: She’s a fantasy character?\nSwift: She’s a real person. Who lived in the house that I live in.\nMcCartney: She’s a real person? I listened to that and I thought, “Who is this?”\nSwift: Her name was Rebekah Harkness. And she lived in the house that I ended up buying in Rhode Island. That’s how I learned about her. But she was a woman who was very, very talked about, and everything she did was scandalous. I found a connection in that. But I also was thinking about how you write “Eleanor Rigby” and go into that whole story about what all these people in this town are doing and how their lives intersect, and I hadn’t really done that in a very long time with my music. It had always been so microscope personal.\nMcCartney: Yeah, ’cause you were writing breakup songs like they were going out of style.\nSwift: I was, before my luck changed . I still write breakup songs. I love a good breakup song. Because somewhere in the world, I always have a friend going through a breakup, and that will make me write one.\nMcCartney: Yeah, this goes back to this thing of me and John: When you’ve got a formula, break it. I don’t have a formula. It’s the mood I’m in. So I love the idea of writing a character. And, you know, trying to think, “What am I basing this on?” So “Eleanor Rigby” was based on old ladies I knew as a kid. For some reason or other, I got great relationships with a couple of local old ladies. I was thinking the other day, I don’t know how I met them, it wasn’t like they were family. I’d just run into them, and I’d do their shopping for them.\nSwift: That’s amazing.\nMcCartney: It just felt good to me. I would sit and talk, and they’d have amazing stories. That’s what I liked. They would have stories from the wartime — because I was born actually in the war — and so these old ladies, they were participating in the war. This one lady I used to sort of just hang out with, she had a crystal radio that I found very magical. In the war, a lot of people made their own radios — you’d make them out of crystals .\nSwift: How did I not know this? That sounds like something I would have tried to learn about.\nMcCartney: It’s interesting, because there is a lot of parallels with the virus and lockdowns and wartime. It happened to everyone. Like, this isn’t HIV, or SARS, or Avian flu, which happened to others, generally. This has happened to everyone, all around the world. That’s the defining thing about this particular virus. And, you know, my parents … it happened to everyone in Britain, including the queen and Churchill. War happened. So they were all part of this thing, and they all had to figure out a way through it. So you figured out folklore. I figured out McCartney III.\nSwift: And a lot of people have been baking sourdough bread. Whatever gets you through!\nMcCartney: Some people used to make radios. And they’d take a crystal — we should look it up, but it actually is a crystal. I thought, “Oh, no, they just called it a crystal radio,” but it’s actually crystals like we know and love.\nSwift: Wow.\nMcCartney: And somehow they get the radio waves — this crystal attracts them — they tune it in, and that’s how they used to get their news. Back to “Eleanor Rigby,” so I would think of her and think of what she’s doing and then just try to get lyrical, just try to bring poetry into it, words you love, just try to get images like “picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been,” and Father McKenzie “is darning his socks in the night.” You know, he’s a religious man, so I could’ve said, you know, “preparing his Bible,” which would have been more obvious. But “darning his socks” kind of says more about him. So you get into this lovely fantasy. And that’s the magic of songs, you know. It’s a black hole, and then you start doing this process, and then there’s this beautiful little flower that you’ve just made. So it is very like embroidery, making something.\nSwift: Making a table.\nMcCartney: Making a table.\nSwift: Wow, it would’ve been so fun to play Glastonbury for the 50th anniversary together.\nMcCartney: It would’ve been great, wouldn’t it? And I was going to be asking you to play with me.\nSwift: Were you going to invite me? I was hoping that you would. I was going to ask you.\nMcCartney: I would’ve done “Shake It Off.”\nSwift: Oh, my God, that would have been amazing.\nMcCartney: I know it, it’s in C!\nSwift: One thing I just find so cool about you is that you really do seem to have the joy of it, still, just no matter what. You seem to have the purest sense of joy of playing an instrument and making music, and that’s just the best, I think.\nMcCartney: Well, we’re just so lucky, aren’t we?\nSwift: We’re really lucky.\nMcCartney: I don’t know if it ever happens to you, but with me, it’s like, “Oh, my god, I’ve ended up as a musician.”\nSwift: Yeah, I can’t believe it’s my job.\nMcCartney: I must tell you a story I told Mary the other day, which is just one of my favorite little sort of Beatles stories. We were in a terrible, big blizzard, going from London to Liverpool, which we always did. We’d be working in London and then drive back in the van, just the four of us with our roadie, who would be driving. And this was a blizzard. You couldn’t see the road. At one point, it slid off and it went down an embankment. So it was “Ahhh,” a bunch of yelling. We ended up at the bottom. It didn’t flip, luckily, but so there we are, and then it’s like, “Oh, how are we going to get back up? We’re in a van. It’s snowing, and there’s no way.” We’re all standing around in a little circle, and thinking, “What are we going to do?” And one of us said, “Well, something will happen.” And I thought that was just the greatest. I love that, that’s a philosophy.\nSwift: “Something will happen.”\nMcCartney: And it did. We sort of went up the bank, we thumbed a lift, we got the lorry driver to take us, and Mal, our roadie, sorted the van and everything. So that was kind of our career. And I suppose that’s like how I ended up being a musician and a songwriter: “Something will happen.”\nSwift: That’s the best.\nMcCartney: It’s so stupid it’s brilliant. It’s great if you’re ever in that sort of panic attack: “Oh, my God,” or, “Ahhh, what am I going to do?”\nSwift: “Something will happen.”\nMcCartney: All right then, thanks for doing this, and this was, you know, a lot of fun.\nSwift: You’re the best.

Pattie Boyd stood at the intersection of fashion, rock ’n’ roll, art, and fame. Widely considered one of the greatest muses of all time, Boyd, who was married first to George Harrison and later to Eric Clapton, inspired the hits “Something” by the Beatles, and “Layla” and “Wonderful Tonight” by Clapton. Recently I devoured this intriguing woman’s memoir, Wonderful Tonight. A few weeks later, I had the pleasure of sitting down with her in the kitchen of her beautiful Kensington flat. As the sunlight poured through the windows, her blue eyes lit up as she spoke. There is a playful quality about her and, surprisingly—considering how much she has experienced in her life—a lightness.\nTAYLOR SWIFT: I have been so excited to talk to you because we’re both women whose lives have been deeply influenced by songs and songwriting. I stand on one side of it, and you on the other. Does the concept of being called a muse feel like a correct fit?\nPATTIE BOYD: I find the concept of being a muse understandable when you think of all the great painters, poets, and photographers who usually have had one or two. The artist absorbs an element from their muse that has nothing to do with words, just the purity of their essence.\nTS: What do you feel might be a factor that artists want to communicate with you through song?\nPB: I think in my case both George and Eric had an inability to communicate their feelings through normal conversation. I became a reflection for them.\nTS: I wondered who and what situation “Wonderful Tonight” was written about, and now I know it’s about you getting ready for a party, changing clothes, and saying, “I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”\nPB: I came downstairs with trepidation thinking was going to be so angry that I’d taken far too long, and instead he said, “Listen, I’ve just written this song.”\nTS: That is so incredible to me.\nPB: But you must do that too. You must be inspired by a few moments or something, the way your boyfriend turns or says something to you or a little bit of a smile or “Is he thinking this or that?,” and that would inspire you. Can you write it the moment it’s happening?\nTS: There are definitely moments when it’s like this cloud of an idea comes and just lands in front of your face, and you reach up and grab it. A lot of songwriting is things you learn, structure, and cultivating that skill, and knowing how to craft a song. But there are mystical, magical moments, inexplicable moments when an idea that is fully formed just pops into your head. And that’s the purest part of my job. It can get complicated on every other level, but the songwriting is still the same uncomplicated process it was when I was 12 years old writing songs in my room.\nPB: Right, right…\nTS: I don’t know what it is that makes some people really creatively inspiring. There have been people I’ve spent a lot of time with who I just couldn’t write about.\nPB: Yes, now what is that?\nTS: I don’t know. It’s just that some people come into your life and they have this effect on you. It’s really interesting because in your case you inspired that creative output from two iconic musicians. That just blows my mind. It’s very rare!\nPB: Well, the more you say it to me, the more it’s blowing my mind.\nTS: You met George Harrison at 19 on the set of A Hard Day’s Night. All of a sudden your life was changed forever because you fell in love with someone who the world was obsessed with. There was no band as big as the Beatles. Did anyone prepare you for the attention?\nPB: No. Nobody took on that role. Nobody thought that role would be significant for a start. I remember a journalist coming to our house one day and saying to George, “In all seriousness, when do you think the bubble is going to burst? When are the Beatles going to be finished?”\nTS: Wow.\nPB: If they thought that, there’s no reason anyone would think, “Ah, I’ll look after Pattie and guide her through what is going to be a tremendously difficult situation for a young girl to cope with.” The only thing Brian Epstein, their manager, told me and the other wives and girlfriends was, “Don’t talk to the press.”\nTS: Were the fans the reason you decided to live in the country?\nPB: Living in London with George, there were so many fans every day, it became impossible to leave the flat. Brian Epstein thought there might be an idea that John, Ringo, and George move to the country, have little houses about an hour out of London. We would decorate the outside of our house with spray-paint cans. The whole house was like a psychedelic monster.\nTS: I remember seeing a picture of the house, and Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull had spray-painted their names on the wall with the words mick and marianne were here. I read a book about Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor recently, and how there was this crazy frenzy surrounding them. In the book, Elizabeth is quoted as saying, “It could be worse, we could be the Beatles.” You are one of the only people who can say they experienced what Beatlemania was like from the inside. How did that feel for you?\nPB: In my first experience, I found it absolutely terrifying. I got to see the Beatles play at a theater in London, and George told me that I should leave with my friends before the last number. So before the last song, we got up from our seats and walked toward the nearest exit door, and there were these girls behind me. They followed us out, and they were kicking me and pulling my hair and pushing us all the way down this long passageway.\nTS: What were they saying?\nPB: “We hate you.”\nTS: That is my worst nightmare. You probably felt like, “If you knew me and I knew you, you would not be pulling my hair in an alleyway and saying, ‘I hate you.’”\nPB: Exactly.\nTS: Has the dynamic changed with Beatles fans now that you put on these incredible exhibitions of your photographs?\nPB: George is no longer with us, or John. It was such a long time ago, and the fans haven’t held on to the same antagonistic feelings toward me. Actually they seem happy that I’m sharing the photographs I took. One time I was having an exhibition, and these girls turned up dressed like me in A Hard Day’s Night.\nTS: It’s so cute when people do that. I love that.\nPB: It is adorable.\nTS: That is amazing that you could go from a place of feeling incredibly frightened by the idea of this attention from people who loved the Beatles, and now there is just a huge amount of gratitude from them. For me, one of the most heartbreaking moments in the book is when, years later, you and Eric get married, and George and his new wife, Olivia, come to the wedding party, Paul comes, Ringo comes, but John couldn’t go. He said later that he would have loved to come. That night there was a huge jam session, and had he been there it would have been the last time the Beatles played together.\nPB: Can you imagine? I was heartbroken.\nTS: My heart was pierced by that.\nPB: John felt he couldn’t come because he thought if he left America they wouldn’t let him back in, and it was important for him to be in America.\nTS: I found it staggeringly beautiful in the book how you had been through many ups and downs, and told these stunning truths about your relationships, but everyone seems to be on really good terms. I mean, Eric even gave you permission to publish his love letters. What did it take for you to arrive at such a place of goodwill with people you’ve been through so much with? Is that just time passing?\nPB: I think time must play a big part. Because it all broke up for whatever reason, there is no need to carry on some sort of hate or dislike for this person. And then with time I thought, “I’ll just call on Eric and see if he’ll let me use these wonderful letters that he wrote, and if he needs anything from me, he just needs to call me, same thing, and I would say ‘yes’ to him.” I think this is all based on my memories of how it was when we were first married and what fun we had, the love that we’d enjoyed together as well.\nTS: It sounds like you take ownership of the past, and not just the good parts.\nPB: I do. Absolutely.\nTS: Lastly, what advice would you give a 28-year-old who’s deeply inspired by your outlook? I would love to look back on my life with the same clarity, wisdom, and peace that you seem to have.\nPB: You have to remember that nothing remains the same. It’s always going to change. The whole world keeps changing, we keep changing, things in our lives keep changing. Nothing remains the same. If you’re happy or you’re sad, it’s not going to last forever. You just have to keep remembering that.", "This is the song that got it all started for me\nIts called Tim McGraw\nHe said the way my blue eyes shined\nPut those Georgia stars to shame that night\nI

To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. I’ve never done this before. In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives.

out of her parents home into her own condo here. Now shes declaring her musical independence, too.\nThe country singer wrote every song by herself on her new album Speak Now, the first that shes completed without co-writers. The lyrics deal with real people—including rapper Kanye West, who famously interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. I write songs that are like diary entries, Ms. Swift says, adding: I have to do it in order to feel sane.\nMs. Swift released her self-titled debut in 2006 at age 16. Her follow-up, Fearless, was the best-selling album in the U.S. in 2009, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and this January it won the Grammy for album of the year. On her new album, due out Monday, the 20-year-old Ms. Swift is looking to appeal to a more mature audience, even if it means leaving some of the Disney/Nickelodeon set behind.\nSpeak Now features a TMZ-style attack on an unnamed starlet. Shes an actress / shes better known for the things that she does on the mattress, Ms. Swift sings on the track Better Than Revenge. In the song Never Grow Up, she writes about moving into a new apartment. Its so much colder than I thought it would be, she sings.\nMs. Swift came for an interview to Café Coco, a spot she frequents with her girlfriends. Accompanied by a security man complete with earpiece, she armed herself with a Rice Krispie treat and talked about her fans, her critics and her album.\nThe Wall Street Journal: Your voice has sometimes been criticized for not being all that strong, especially in live performances. How do you feel about that?\nMs. Swift: I dont really have a standard criticism policy for how I handle it. Because it seems like its always something different thats being said in a different way by a different person…There are some times when I can just brush it off and be fine after I hear something negative. But there are times when it absolutely levels me.\nTell me about the song Mean on your new album.\nMean is about this—Im used to criticism because thats part of what I do, taking criticism. When its constructive I have an appreciation for it, but when it crosses a line, and becomes mean, I write songs like that about it.\nWith a young audience following you, is it hard to grow up and write honestly about adult experiences?\nFactoring in millions of people when Im writing a song is not a good idea. I dont ever do it.\nWhat about in your day-to-day life?\nWhen I was 8 years old, it mattered what my favorite singer said and wore and expressed opinions about. And if I have a chance to matter to the growth and hopes and wishes of little girls, thats something I cant take lightly. So I do factor them in when Im thinking about what to wear, and what to say, and whether or not to go out to bars even though Im not 21.\nWhy did you go without co-writers on Speak Now?\nIt originally was inspired by circumstance. I would get inspired to write a song at 3:30 in the morning. Theres no co-writer around.\nWere you trying to prove something to the world as an artist by writing everything yourself?\nI just felt like all these crazy things were happening in my life.\nCan you give me an example?\nDifferent relationships. Realizations you come to based on the beginning and ending of those relationships and everything you learn in between. You have people come into your life shockingly and surprisingly. You have losses that you never thought youd experience. You have rejection and you have learn how to deal with that and how to get up the next day and go on with it.\nAre you going to scare boyfriends away because they might end up in one of your songs if things dont go so well?\nThe only thing I can say about that is that this is not a surprise that I do this. Everyone has had fair warning. This is my third album. Ive never been shy or secretive with the fact that if you walk into my life, you may be walking onto a record.\nThe title song on the album is about a woman who dreams about interrupting the wedding of a guy she likes. Is that based on anything in your real life?\nWell, Ive never interrupted a wedding. But if I did, thats how I would do it. A few of my friends had ex-boyfriends who were getting married. And I went through that with them in venting sessions…And of course I started having dreams about what if my ex-boyfriend got married to someone else? So a lot of the songs on this record are pulled straight from my life. Then there are songs like Speak Now that are an extension of my feelings and hypothetically what I would do.\nDo you feel that your early fame has cut you off from experiences that might have fed into your songwriting? Any regrets that you became so successful so young?\nI heard a quote from Dolly Parton one time and she said that regrets arent fair to you because you couldnt possibly have known then what you know now. And a lot of times I wish I could live life more like her. Just this clarity about how to process regret. But on this particular subject about the path that I chose in life I do not regret anything. Im very aware and very conscious of the path I chose in life, and very aware of the path I didnt choose.\nSo what was the path you didnt choose?\nMy parents were in finance. They thought I was going to be a stockbroker and go to business school and college—and my brothers at Notre Dame. All my friends are at college. I keep one eye on the path I didnt choose every day. Thats why I go and attend journalism classes at my friend Abigails college. Because I just want to sit there and see what its like for a day. Thats why I go to Notre Dame and visit my brother and sit in his dorm room. The life I chose is very different from theirs.", "Im writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which Ill be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past Ive been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG. I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.\nI cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values.

Her security detail suggests that it’s probably not a paparazzo because there’s no way a paparazzo could find us at such an unglamorous, unassuming establishment. But as with seemingly every other inference she has ever made, Taylor Swift is ultimately proven right. The guy in the gray car is taking her picture. This annoys her, but just barely.\nIt’s August in Southern California. We crawl into the back of a massive Toyota and start driving to Swift’s West Coast residence, located in a rural enclave of Beverly Hills. The gray car trails us through Franklin Canyon. Swift whips out her phone and starts showing me images from the video shoot for “Wildest Dreams,” including a clip of a giraffe licking her face. She has more photos on her phone than any person I’ve ever met. “I wanted this video to be about the making of a 1950s movie being filmed on location in Africa,” she explains. Swift came up with the concept after reading a book by Ava Gardner and Peter Evans, The Secret Conversations. Her premise for the video is that—since social media did not exist in the ’50s—it would be impossible for actors not to fall in love if they were isolated together in Africa, since there would be no one else to talk to.\nWe chat a little about Ryan Adams and a little about books. Swift mentions that she wrote a non-autobiographical novel when she was 14, titled A Girl Named Girl, and that her parents still have it. I ask her what it was about, assuming she will laugh. But her memory of the plot is remarkably detailed. If she released it today, it would immediately be the best-selling YA novel in the nation. When she was about that same age, Swift’s family moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville, to jump-start her music career. I ask what she imagines might have happened if they’d never moved and if she’d never become an artist. “I would still be involved with music in my spare time,” she says. “But I would have gone to college, and I would probably be involved with a form of business where words and ideas are at the forefront. Such as marketing.” She returns to her phone and starts scrolling for an old voice memo she sent to Jack Antonoff of the band Bleachers while they were co-writing songs for 1989. Antonoff’s nickname for Swift is Dead Tooth, a reference to a minor dental mishap. Just as she tells me this, her cell phone rings. The display panel says the incoming call is from J TIMB. “Oh, my God. Justin Timberlake?” Her surprise does not seem artificial. “Can I take this?”\nShe takes the call. The volume on her phone is loud enough for me to intermittently hear both sides of the conversation. Swift explains that she’s driving to her house, but that she can’t actually stay there because contractors are renovating almost every room. “Have you ever seen the movie The Money Pit?” asks Timberlake. She has not, so Timberlake provides a capsule review. He has a 4-month-old baby at home and is constantly tired, yet he can’t fall sleep. He asks Swift for advice on sleeping. Swift tells the driver to pull over to the shoulder of the road, since she keeps losing reception as we drive through the canyon. The paparazzo in the gray car casually passes, having not-so-casually followed us for at least five miles.\nThe conversation lasts almost 15 minutes . “You’re never going to get old,” Swift assures Timberlake. “That’s scientific fact. That’s medical.” Even her sarcasm is aspirational. Eventually JT tells her the reason he’s calling is because he wants to perform the song “Mirrors” with her on the last night of her upcoming five-date stand at Staples Center. She reacts to this news the way a teenage girl in Nebraska would react if suddenly informed that a paternity test had revealed Taylor Swift was her biological sister.\nWhen she ends the call, Swift looks at me and says, “This is so crazy. This is so crazy.” She repeats that phrase four times, each time with ascending volume.\nNow, inside my skull, I am thinking one thought: This is not remotely crazy. It actually seems like the opposite of crazy. Why wouldn’t Justin Timberlake want to perform with the biggest entertainer in America, to an audience of 15,000 people who will lose their collective mind the moment he appears? I’d have been much more surprised if he’d called to turn her down. But then I remember that Swift is 25 years old, and that her entire ethos is based on experiencing how her insane life would feel if she were exactly like the type of person who’d buy a ticket to this particular concert. She has more perspective than I do. Every extension of who she is and how she works is “so crazy,” and what’s even crazier is my inability to recognize just how crazy it is.\nSo Taylor Swift is right again.If you don’t take Swift seriously, you don’t take contemporary music seriously. With the exceptions of Kanye West and Beyoncé Knowles, she is the most significant pop artist of the modern age. The scale of her commercial supremacy defies parallel—she’s sold 1 million albums in a week three times, during an era when most major artists are thrilled to move 500,000 albums in a year. If a record as comparatively dominant as 1989 had actually existed in the year 1989, it would have surpassed the sales of Thriller. There is no demographic she does not tap into, which is obviously rare. But what’s even more atypical is how that ubiquity is critically received. Swift gets excellent reviews, particularly from the most significant arbiters of taste. She has never gratuitously sexualized her image and seems pathologically averse to controversy. There’s simply no antecedent for this kind of career: a cross-genre, youth-oriented, critically acclaimed colossus based entirely on the intuitive songwriting merits of a single female artist. It’s as if mid-period Garth Brooks was also early Liz Phair, minus the hat and the swearing. As a phenomenon, it’s absolutely new.\nAnd this, somewhat predictably, creates a new set of problems.\nEven within the most high-minded considerations of Swift’s music, there is inevitably some analysis about her personal life. She’s an utterly credible musician who is consumed as a tabloid personality. Very often , that binary is attributed to ingrained biases against female performers. But it’s more complicated than that. Swift writes about her life so directly that the listener is forced to think about her persona in order to fully appreciate what she’s doing creatively. This is her greatest power: an ability to combine her art and her life so profoundly that both spheres become more interesting to everyone, regardless of their emotional investment in either.\nSwift clearly knows this is happening. But she can’t directly admit it, because it’s the kind of thing that only works when it seems accidental. She’s careful how she describes the process, because you don’t become who she is by describing things carelessly.\nEven the most serious critics inevitably discuss the more tabloid aspects of your life. Is this valid? Does the fact that you write about yourself in such a confessional style require intelligent people to look at your music through that lens?\nI don’t feel there is any injustice when people expand beyond my music and speculate on who certain songs might be about. I’ve never named names, so I feel like I still have a sense of power over what people say—even if that isn’t true, and even if I don’t have any power over what people say about me. The fact that I’ve never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I’m holding. So if you’re going to look at your life and say, “I get to play sold-out football stadiums all over the world. I get to call up my favorite artists and ask them to perform with me, and most of the time they say yes. I get to be on the cover of this magazine”—this is all because I write songs about my own life. So I would feel a little strange complaining about how it’s covered.\nBut I’m not asking if it’s fair or unfair, or if the downside is worth the upside. I’m asking from an aesthetic perspective: Is thinking about your real life an essential part of appreciating your music? Could your music be enjoyed the same way in a vacuum, even if no one knew anything else about you?\n“Shake It Off” is one of my most successful songs, and that has nothing directly, intricately, pointedly personal in it. No one really says I stay out too late. I just thought it sounded good.\nHave you ever stopped yourself from writing a fictional lyric because you feared it would be incorrectly applied to your nonfictional life?\nNo. Some of the things I write about on a song like “Blank Space” are satire. You take your creative license and create things that are larger than life. You can write things like I get drunk on jealousy but you’ll come back each time you leave, ’cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream. That is not my approach to relationships. But is it cool to write the narrative of a girl who’s crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative? That was the character I felt the media had written for me, and for a long time I felt hurt by it. I took it personally. But as time went by, I realized it was kind of hilarious.\nIt’s impossible for an artist to control how she is perceived. But an artist can anticipate those perceptions, which is almost as good. “A nuanced sense of humor does not translate on a general scale,” Swift says, “and I knew that going in. I knew some people would hear ‘Blank Space’ and say, See, we were right about her. And at that point, I just figure if you don’t get the joke, you don’t deserve to get the joke.”There’s a long tradition of musicians expressing a degree of disinterest in how they are metabolized by the culture. They claim to ignore their own reviews while feigning a lack of discernment about what their audience wants or expects, since these are things that cannot be manipulated. Swift is not like this. She has an extrinsic focus that informs her creative process. From her perspective, not tracking how people view your work feels stranger than the alternative.\n“I went through a few years where I just never went online and never looked at blogs,” she recalls. “This was around 2013, when the only thing anyone wanted to write about me was about me and some guy. It was really damaging. You’re thinking, ‘Everybody goes on dates when they’re 22. It’s fine, right?’ Nope. Not when you’re in this situation, and everything you do is blown out of proportion and expanded upon. And all of a sudden, there’s an overriding opinion that doesn’t accurately reflect how you actually live your life. So I didn’t go online for a year and a half. I actually forgot my Instagram password. But now I check in and see what’s happening. In 2015, that stuff does matter. Because if enough people say the same thing about me, it becomes fact in the general public’s mind. So I monitor what people say about me, and if I see a theme, I know what that means. I’ve had it happen twice before. In 2010, it was She’s too young to get all these awards. Look how annoying she is when she wins. Is she even good? And then in 2013, it was She just writes songs about guys to get revenge. She’s boy-crazy. She’s a problematic person. It will probably be something else again this year.”\nHow you view this level of consciousness is proportional to how you feel about Swift as a public figure. There is a perpetual sense that nothing about her career is accidental and that nothing about her life is unmediated. These are not unusual thoughts to have about young mainstream stars. But what’s different with Swift is her autonomy. There is no Svengali directing her career; there is no stage mother pushing her toward the spotlight. She is in total control of her own constructed reality. If there was a machine that built humans out of positive millennial stereotypes, Swift would be its utopian creation.\n“I used to watch Behind the Music every day,” she says. “When other kids were watching normal shows, I’d watch Behind the Music. And I would see these bands that were doing so well, and I’d wonder what went wrong. I thought about this a lot. And what I established in my brain was that a lack of self-awareness was always the downfall. That was always the catalyst for the loss of relevance and the loss of ambition and the loss of great art. So self-awareness has been such a huge part of what I try to achieve on a daily basis. It’s less about reputation management and strategy and vanity than it is about trying to desperately preserve self-awareness, since that seems to be the first thing to go out the door when people find success.”\nThe advantage of this self-focused fixation is clear. Swift is allowed to make whatever record she wants, based on the reasonable argument that she understands her specific space in the culture more deeply than anyone around her. The making of 1989 is a prime example: She claims everyone at her label tried to persuade her not to make a straightforward pop album. She recounts a litany of arguments with various label executives over every possible detail, from how much of her face would appear on the cover to how co-writer Max Martin would be credited in the liner notes.\nAs far as I can tell, Swift won every one of these debates.\n“Even calling this record 1989 was a risk,” she says. “I had so many intense conversations where my label really tried to step in. I could tell they’d all gotten together and decided, ‘We gotta talk some sense into her. She’s had an established, astronomically successful career in country music. To shake that up would be the biggest mistake she ever makes.’ But to me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk. I know how to write a song. I’m not confident about a lot of other aspects of my life, but I know how to write a song. I’d read a review of Red that said it wasn’t sonically cohesive. So that was what I wanted on 1989: an umbrella that would go over all of these songs, so that they all belonged on the same album. But then I’d go into the label office, and they were like, ‘Can we talk about putting a fiddle and a steel-guitar solo on ‘Shake It Off’ to service country radio?’ I was trying to make the most honest record I could possibly make, and they were kind of asking me to be a little disingenuous about it: ‘Let’s capitalize on both markets.’ No, let’s not. Let’s choose a lane.”Like almost all famous people, Swift has two ways of speaking. The first is the way she talks when she’s actively shaping the interview—optimistic, animated, and seemingly rehearsed . The second is the way she talks when she cares less about the way the words are presented and more about the message itself . The first way is how she talks when she’s on television; the second is unequivocal and less animatronic. But she oscillates between the two styles fluidly, because either this dissonance is less intentional than it appears or she can tell I’m considerably more interested in anything delivered in the second style.\nate in our lunch, I mention something that happened several years ago: By chance, I’d found myself having dinner with a former acquaintance of Swift’s who offhandedly described her as “calculating.” This is the only moment during our interview when Swift appears remotely flustered. She really, really hates the word calculating. She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization. As she explains these things, her speech does not oscillate from the second mode.\n“Am I shooting from the hip?” she asks rhetorically. “Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing—the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work—and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.”\nHere we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated. This even applies to casual, non-romantic relationships. Over the past three years, Swift has built a volunteer army of high-profile friends, many of whom appear in her videos and serve as special guests at her concerts. In almost any other circumstance, this would be seen as a likable trait; Leonardo DiCaprio behaved similarly in the ’90s, and everyone thought it was awesome. But it’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League . Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments. “I honestly think my lack of female friendships in high school and middle school is why my female friendships are so important now,” she says. “Because I always wanted them. It was just hard for me to have friends.”\nPopular people often claim they were once unpopular, so I ask Swift for a specific example. She tells a story about middle school, when she called several of her peers on the phone and asked if they wanted to go shopping. Every girl had a different excuse for why she couldn’t go. Eventually, Swift’s mother agreed to take her to the local mall. When they arrived, Swift saw all of the girls she had called on the phone, goofing around in Victoria’s Secret. “I just remember my mom looking at me and saying, We’re going to King of Prussia Mall. Which is the big, big mall in Pennsylvania, 45 minutes away. So we left and went to the better mall. My mom let me escape from certain things that were too painful to deal with. And we talked about it the whole ride there, and we had a good time shopping.”\nThis incident appears to be the genesis for a verse in her 2008 song “The Best Day,” a connection she doesn’t note when she tells me the story. A cynical person could read something into this anecdote and turn it into a metaphor about capitalism or parenting or creativity or Pennsylvania. But in the framework of our conversation, it did not seem metaphoric of anything. It just seemed like a memory that might be more internally motivating than any simplistic desire for money or power.\nSo is it unfair to categorize Swift as calculating? Maybe, and particularly if you view that term as exclusively pejorative. But calling her guileless would be even crazier. Swift views her lyrics as the most important part of her art , so we spend some time parsing specific passages from specific songs. Here is how she dissects the conjecture over “Bad Blood,” a single universally assumed to be about Katy Perry.\nYou never say who your songs are about, but you concede that if enough people believe something, it essentially becomes fact. So by not saying who you’re writing about, aren’t you allowing public consensus to dictate the meaning of your work? If everyone assumes that “Bad Blood” is about a specific person, aren’t you allowing the culture to create a fact about your life?\nYou’re in a Rolling Stone interview, and the writer says, “Who is that song about? That sounds like a really intense moment from your life.” And you sit there, and you know you’re on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don’t want him—or his family—to think you’re firing shots at him. So you say, “That was about losing a friend.” And that’s basically all you say. But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant. I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn’t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship.\nBut nobody thinks that song is about a guy.\nBut they would have. So I don’t necessarily care who people think it’s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn’t point to any one person or any one situation. But if you’d listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship.Now, there are more than a few molecules of bullshit in this response. When Swift says, “And that’s basically all you say,” she’s neglecting to mention that she also told the reporter that the disharmony stemmed from a business conflict, and that the individual in question tried to sabotage an arena tour by hiring away some of her employees. These details dramatically reduce the pool of potential candidates. Yet consider the strategy’s larger brilliance: In order to abort the possibility of a rumor she did not want, she propagated the existence of a different rumor that offered the added value of making the song more interesting.\nSwift can manufacture the kind of mythology that used to happen to Carly Simon by accident.Speaking of accidents, here’s some breaking news: They happen to Taylor Swift, too. She believes the most consequential accident of her professional life was when Kanye West famously stormed the stage during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. I’m surprised when she brings this up unprompted, because she has barely addressed the incident in five years, aside from the song “Innocent.” But fences have been mended and feelings have been felt. At this summer’s VMAs, Swift warmly presented West with the Video Vanguard trophy. She’ll probably serve as Secretary of the Interior when he becomes president.\nSwift was lauded for handling West’s ’09 intrusion with grace and composure, but her personal memories of the event dwell on the bewilderment. When West first jumped onstage, Swift halfway assumed he was about to make a special presentation, honoring her for being the first country artist to ever win a VMA. She truly had no idea what was transpiring. “When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn’t deserve the award. That’s where the hurt came from. I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn’t that big of a deal. But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other—that’s one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.”\nSwift analyzes her friendships so often that I eventually ask what seems like an obvious question: Does she ever feel lonely? She responds by literally talking about Friends. “I’m around people so much,” she says. “Massive amounts of people. I do a meet-and-greet every night on the tour, and it’s 150 people. Before that, it’s a radio meet-and-greet with 40 people. After the show, it’s 30 or 40 more people. So then when I go home and turn on the TV, and I’ve got Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey on a Friends marathon, I don’t feel lonely. I’ve just been onstage for two hours, talking to 60,000 people about my feelings. That’s so much social stimulation. When I get home, there is not one part of me that wishes I was around other people.”\nThis is understandable. Still, I note something any musician obsessed with self-awareness would undoubtedly recognize: In the retrospective context of a hypothetical Behind the Music episode, this anecdote would be framed as depressing. It would paint the portrait of a super-famous entertainer spending her day emoting to thousands of strangers, only to return home to an empty house and the one-way company of two-dimensional characters.\nDoes she not see the irony?\nOh, she sees it. But that doesn’t mean it’s real.\n“There is such a thing as having enough,” she says in her non-TV voice. “You might think a meet-and-greet with 150 people sounds sad, because maybe you think I’m forced to do it. But you would be surprised. A meaningful conversation doesn’t mean that conversation has to last an hour. A meet-and-greet might sound weird to someone who’s never done one, but after ten years, you learn to appreciate happiness when it happens, and that happiness is rare and fleeting, and that you’re not entitled to it. You know, during the first few years of your career, the only thing anyone says to you is ‘Enjoy this. Just enjoy this.’ That’s all they ever tell you. And I finally know how to do that.”\nTaylor Swift is 25.

you turned it into, a completely involuntary smile creeps across my face. this was the musical era in which so many inside jokes were created between us, so many hugs exchanged and hands touched, so many unbreakable bonds formed. so before i say anything else, let me just say that it was a real honor to get to be a teenager alongside you. and for those of you ive come to know more recently than 2008, i am ecstatic that ill get to exPerience a bit of that feeling with you in the very near future. now that i can fully appreciate it in its whimsical, effervescent, chaotic entirety.\nfearless

songs.\nive spoken a lot about why im remaking my first six albums, but the way ive chosen to do this will hopefuLy help illuminate where im coming from. artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one who really knows that body of work. for example, only i know which songs i wrote that almost made the fearless album. songs i absolutely adored, but were held back for different reasons .\nthose reasons seem unnecessary now. ive decIded i want you to have the whole story, see the entire vivid picture and let you into the entire dreamscape that is my fearless album. thats why ive chosen to include 6 never before released songs on my version of this album. written when i was betweeN the ages 16 and 18, these were the ones it killed me to leave behind.\nthis process has been more fulfilling and emoTional than i couldve imagined and has made me even more determined to re-recorded all of my music. i Hope youll like this first outing as much as i liked traveling back in time to recreate it.\nlove story will be out tonight.\nsincerely and fearlessly,\ntaylor", "What a shame\nDidnt wanna be the one that got

laptop. Im watching a video of a familiar-looking man wearing a black tuxedo. The video seems to be of a televised award show. The tape is grainy, but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear:\nNow Im gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes youll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brendas metal in this song I wish Id wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee.\nThe camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and shes looking down at a framed picture. Shes at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. Thats when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is Someone Loves You Honey. The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee.\nBrenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock & roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her.\nI watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. Theres a reason shes been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure.

really, really honored to be receiving this award because it honors the part of my job that is so magical and mystical to me, still. I love songwriting so much because there’s an element to it that is still really mysterious — like I think any songwriter will tell you, when you get an idea you’re not quite sure where it floated down from, but if you can grab onto that idea and turn it into something, a piece of music, that’s where craftsmanship comes in; that’s where you have thе opportunity to learn and to nurture that craft, and I want to take a momеnt to thank the people who were my professors, my teachers, of the craft of songwriting.\nFirst of all, to anyone who wrote with me in Nashville when I was in eighth or ninth grade: That is insane that you did that, and I am so lucky that I got to learn from some of the best writers on Music Row. Liz Rose was someone who spent hours and hours and hours with me when there was absolutely no sign that anything would happen in my career. My dance card was not full, I was 14, and she wrote with me so many times and taught me how to edit my ideas down into something that would pack an emotional punch.\nThen, later in my career, I got to work with Max Martin and Johan Shellback, who I learned so much from a melodic sense, and I will carry those lessons with me for the rest of my life. I will learn more lessons from them next time we work together, and I feel really lucky that they’ve been a part of my life.\nJack Antonoff is such a wonderful creator and such a nurturing presence — with his own art and other artists, he’s just so versatile and such a wonderful friend. Aaron Dessner came into my life recently, and he is just such a prolific creator. All of these people changed my writing and helped shape it.\nThere are so many others, though. So if you’ve ever sat in a room and cowritten with me, thank you so much. Anyone who’s ever wanted to produce one of my songs, any collaborator I’ve ever had — I’ve learned from all of you. I want to say thank you to Troy Tomlinson for always being excited to hear new songs of mine, and to Jody Gerson for being such a champion of female songwriters throughout the industry.\nThis is something I am so proud to receive. And to the fans who are out there who care about my lyrics — you have no idea how much it means to me that you dissect them and copy them into your journals and care about the words that I write.\nThere are amazing songwriters who came before me who deserve this, there are incredible songwriters coming up now who are so impressive and amazing: I have such an affinity and respect for all of you. I am honored to receive this. Thank you so much.", "Elevator buttons and morning air\nStrangers silence makes me want to take the stairs\nIf you were here, wed laugh about their vacant stares\nBut right now, my time is theirs\nSeems like theres always someone who disapproves\nTheyll judge it like they know about me and you\nAnd the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do\nThe jurys out, but my choice is you\nSo dont you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the waters rough\nBut this love is ours\nYou never know what people have up their sleeves\nGhosts from your past gonna jump out at me\nLurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles\nBut I dont care, cause right now, youre mine\nAnd youll say\nDont you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nThe stakes are high, the waters rough\nBut this love is ours\nAnd its not theirs to speculate if its wrong\nAnd your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong\nAnd Ill fight their doubt and give you faith\nWith this song for you\nCause I love the gap between your teeth\nAnd I love the riddles that you speak\nAnd any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos\nWill be ignored\nCause my heart is yours\nSo dont you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nAnd life makes love look hard\nDont you worry your pretty little mind\nPeople throw rocks at things that shine\nBut they cant take whats ours\nThey cant take whats ours\nThe stakes are high, the waters rough\nBut this love is ours", "Lyrics from Snippet\nI do the same thing I told you that I never would\nI told you Id change, even when I knew I never could\nI know that I cant find nobody else as good as you\nI need you to stay, yeah, need you to stay, hey\nI do the same thing I told you that I never would\nI told you Id change, even when I knew I never could\nI know that I cant find nobody else as good as you\nI need you to stay, yeah, need you to stay, hey\nRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\nIll be waiting, all therеs left to do is run\nIll be the princе, youll be the princess\nIts a love story, baby, just say Yes...", "White shirt now red, my bloody nose\nSleepin, youre on your tippy toes\nCreepin around like no one knows\nThink youre so criminal\nBruises on both my knees for you\nDont say thank you or please\nI do what I want when Im wanting to\nMy soul?

és a kalózhajók és a 7 törpe életkora\nApa okos\nÉs te vagy a legszebb hölgy az egész nagy világon\nMost már tudom, hogy az összes fa miért változik meg az ősszel\nTudom, hogy még akkor is mellettem álltál, amikor nem volt igazam\nÉs szeretlek azért, hogy nekem adtad a szemeid\nÉs, hogy a háttérben maradtál és néztél engem, ahogy ragyogok\nÉs nem tudom, hogy tudod-e, szóval megragadom az alkalmat, hogy elmondjam\nHogy a legjobb napot töltöttem ma veled", "Ő érzékeny és annyira elképesztő\nÉs az összes szingli barátnőm féltékeny\nMinden olyat mond, amit hallani szeretnék és ez olyan,

fog\nKözel áll az anyukámhoz\nÜzletről beszélget az apukámmal\nŐ elbűvölő és megnyerő\nÉs komfortosan érzem magam\nDe hiányzik a sikítás és a veszekedés és a csókólózás az esőben\nÉs éjjel 2 óra van

mindent tudok érezni\nÉs én így szerettelek\nÉs ő nem látja a mosolyt, amit tettetek\nÉs a szívem nem törik össze\nMert egyáltalán nem érzek semmit\nÉs te vad és őrült voltál\nEgyszerűen csak annyira frusztráló\nMámorító, bonyolult\nElmentél néhány hiba miatt és most\nDe hiányzik a sikítás és a veszekedés és a csókólózás az esőben\nÉs éjjel 2 óra van és átkozom a neved\nAnnyira szerelmes vagyok, hogy őrülten viselkedtem\nÉs én így szerettelek\nKönnyekre fakadás és szétválás\nEz egy hullámvasútszerű hirtelen izgalom\nÉs sose gondoltam, hogy ennyi mindent tudok érezni\nÉs én így szerettelek oh,
