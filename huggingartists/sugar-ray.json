See, thats my hood but more ruthless\nThe method on how they call it depends on your wallet\nFrom the outside they pretend its Sweet Home\nWhere little eight-year-old kids have their own cell phone\nIts the burbs, where moneys the only need\nCause millionaires survive on principles of lust and greed\nSee, we talk about a place where middle class is second rate\nRidiculed at an early age for not having a guarded gate\nAnd in this case, parents try to buy their kids love\nHow do you think most of these kids can afford all of these drugs?\nBut we sit back and act like its the best place on Earth\nWithout admitting the worst shit happens right in our suburbs\nYo\nWhen youre on top of the world its lonely\nWhen you have everything its empty\nAnd the ones you call friends are your

course\nKids are dissed for looking different or cause they cant play sports\nNo surprise when wed come back from Christmas break\nTo see most of the girls noses molded into pretty shapes\nAnd if girls have problems Daddy buys em bigger breasts\nLike every answer to the test is resting in your daughters chest\nTheres so much plastic surgery people look obscene\nGirls following images that cant humanly be achieved\nIts a vicious cycle, realitys distorted\nWhy do you think all of these girls develop eating disorders?\nCause girls who weigh more get called ugly and fat\nAnd we expect these kids to keep level-headed through all that?\nYeah we look happy, but whats it all worth?\nCause you lose your identity living in suburbs\nWhat\nWhen youre on top of the world its lonely\nWhen you have
