ligt de Bijbel en de krant\nHet is mijn inspiratie, ik lees ze beiden elke dag\nIk breng de boodschap voor n ieder, ik zal niet zwijgen tot het graf\nIk zie het als mijn taak en de liefde voor mijn naaste\nMaar ik kan het niet alleen, heb hier al mijn broeders naast me\nIk zie mensen blijven graaien, ja, ze leven ego?stisch\nKijk nou eens om je heen, h? bro, je mist iets\nPak rust neem je tijd, bid God dat Hij je begeleidt\nKies je pad, niet rechts en links tegelijk\nJe luistert wel, maar begrijp je wel wat we bedoelen, man?\nIk leef voor broederschap, zet je woofers hard\nVoel die broeder-love en ga je Bijbel zoeken gap\nHaal hem uit je boekenkast, samen sterk is het motto\nYeah We blijven moven gast\nWe komen hier samen, we komen niet alleen\nWe zijn samen chillen, ja je weet het meteen\nAan het chillen met mijn maten\nHet was relaxed, we lachten en we praatten\nOver de laatste platen, toen we daar gister zaten\nDe muziek luisterden en de tijd die we vergaten\nHet kwam door die gezelligheid\nDe tijd vliegt voorbij op hoge snelheid\nSamen vermijden we de eenzaamheid\nEn we praten uitgebreid over de werkelijkheid\nVan het dagelijks leven en de dingen die we beleven\nOver school en de games die we spelen\nWe hebben geen zin om naar huis te gaan\nBlijven is wat ik wil, want het is hier te chill\nOok al is het ondertussen best wel laat\nGezellig jah, dat was het inderdaad\nCheck it yall\nSamen sterk, dat is samen aan het werk\nSamen sterk, betekent samen naar de kerk\nSamen is niet alleen, sprak de trainer\nTwee weten meer dan een, dat is zeker\nToch denken veel mensen het zelf te weten\nHulp wordt niet gevraagd, men moest eens weten\nKruip uit je schulp, mens durf te leven\nSurfen op het net, doe ik vaak uit verveling\nIk heb liever een gesprek om de waarheid te delen\nn Samenleving moet geen oppervlakkig spel zijn\nWe razen door het leven als een sneltrein\nEn al dat gejaag is niet goed voor ons welzijn, laten we welzijn\nSamen leven in het nu lijkt een ontheemd begrip\nWe geven niet thuis, want het is ieder voor zich\nSchreeuw het eens uit, cre?er een tegengeluid\nAlleen samen sterk, liefde is onze plicht\nLaten we leven, laten we muren afbreken\nDie weerhouden om de liefde aan elkaar te geven\nUit vele stromingen gekomen tot 1\nWe hebben veel meer dan we denken met elkaar gemeen\nWe zijn verschillend door het vlees, maar 1 in de geest\nVerlost van ons verleden om te schijnen in het heden\nGeroepen en vereeuwigd door het Woord dat leven bracht\nVerankerd in de dag, we dwalen niet meer in de nacht\nHet is de Redder Christus, waar ons leven over gaat\nGeboren in de nacht, de sterren straalden voor Zijn macht\nWie heeft het ooit gedacht, dat Hij zou opstaan uit het graf\nGeboren om te sterven door Zijn leven die Hij gaf\nDe prijs die is betaald, de overwinning is behaald\nDe dood is overwonnen door het lot dat is bepaald\nVerenigde hiphopkrachten, die bundelen ons samen\nAls natuurproducten, het water, vuur en aarde\nDit is onze kracht, we zijn samen sterk\nDe beat, de ryhmes, het betere werk\nIk schrijf mijn tekst, ik neem de tijd\nIk verdeel mijn lines, neem je mee op reis\nWil je een gat voor me graven, kan je n schop krijgen\nAls je niks goeds te zeggen hebt, kan je beter zwijgen\nPassie Posse met vrienden en hun maten erbij\nGame over, de sterkste zijn wij\nOnze strijdlust, die zonder grenzen\nk Heb vertrouwen in hiphop, this is it\nHiphop-krachten, samen sterk\nVuur met mate, het werkt\nPassie Posse, de rapfanaten zijn wij\nHomie spit, de weg is vrij\nB-naar-de-U-naar-de-S-naar-de-Y\nER is niet veel bezig zonder mij\nZonder dikke emcees, zonder die dikke beat\nMaar zonder connecties, ach dan red ik t echt niet\nH t t p dubbele punt slash slash\nZoek mij maar op dat internet\nAchwat, laat dat zoeken - eigenlijk maar schieten\nBusyR.com staat al bij je favorieten\nIk staar naar mn scherm, maar voel me verloren\nCheck mn mail, mn krabbels, t forum\nIk weet dat die grote woorden op zich staan\nIk voel me de minste, slechts deel van t lichaam\nIk ben niet doof, maar spreek toch met mn handen\nIk kan t niet alleen, en dat is toch geen schande\nk Broadcast me suf als n hub in n netwerk\nIn contrast de stuff als in samen staan we vet sterk!\nLos op de beat als een boot die gaat varen\nInhoudsloos als een doos, dus die klus ga ik klaren\nIk ga je inpakken, euh, dat mag ik hopen\nNiet interessant, voor mijn part kom jij doper\nEen volwassene of kind, wat denk jij, zeker beiden\nIk meen te weten, dat je die twee niet moet scheiden\nIk kom niet bescheiden, want ik spit vol vuur\nDas zeker clich?, dus raak niet overstuur\nIk kom gewoon zo en ik kom best hard\nIk rap in de maat en ik kom als een bard met een baard\nAch, het is het best waard, wat ik nog mis is de room op mijn taart\nLees het Woord, check de mieren, wordt wijzer\nZie ze samen tillen, wat moet ik dan nog bewijzen\nBen je nou kind, grote reus, kleine dwerg\nSamen ben je sterk, samen kom je op de berg\nHe yo, het is de de K, E, griekse Y\nNiet ik, niet jij, maar wij\nVele rappers in de rij\nZo samen sterk aan het werk\nAlsof dit dagelijkse kost is\nWeet je nu hoe die mic gebossed is\nWisten we niet wie er moest beginnen\nWeet je dus nu dat er getost is\nZo van je kop of munt, gaan we hier voor een stunt\nVanuit het hele land slaan wij de handen in ??n\nTwee, drie, ??n visie, ??n doel\nLaat ons het licht zijn, dat ze het licht zien\nDit onze plicht is, wat zeker niet mis is\nHier die laatste lines, van deze emcee die dismissed is\nSamen sterk, dat is het betere werk\nOmzien naar elkaar, doe dat in het nieuwe jaar\nZet je voornemen maar klaar, en ook stoppen met roken\nNiet meer liegen, lekker koken\nJa, je kunt het met de Heer, keer op keer leidt Hij je weer\nJa, ik kom wederom, Miss B op de trom, nee, niet op de trom, op de mic\nHet is niet altijd makkelijk, het is niet altijd fijn\nMaar als je leeft met de Heer, weet je hoe het hoort te zijn\nTalenten gaan we bundelen, dan wordt het meer en meer\nDe wereld wordt weer mooier, dus ik zeg je keer op keer\nJe bent een kei, je hoort erbij en een kip die legt een ei\nGeen grappen en grollen, laat me niet met je dollen\nWant ik rap je eruit en weg is die buit\nJa, t is net een orkest, muzikanten doen hun best\nEn het knalt als een huis, samen sterk op de buis, dicht als een kluis\nNee geen Remi, maar samen staan we sterk",
