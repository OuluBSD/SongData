happened, it’s just that I prefer to remember them in an artistic way.

Memories are not recycled like atoms and particles in quantum physics. They can be lost forever. It’s sort of like my past is an unfinished painting and as the artist of that painting I must fill in all the ugly holes, and make it beautiful again. It’s not that I have been dishonest; it’s just that I loathe reality\nFor example those nurses, theyre wearing next season Calvin Klein and so am I. And the shoes custom Giuseppe Zanotti.

Bam\nThe truth is back at the clinic they only wore those funny hats to keep the blood out of their hair. And that girl on the left she ordered gummy bears and a knife a couple of hours ago, they only gave her the gummy bears. Id wish theyd only given me the gummy bears\nThe Prelude Pathétique- Last Part:\nYou may say I lost everything. But I still had my Be-Dazzler.

But the birth was not finite, it was infinite. As the wombs numbered and the mitosis of the future began it was perceived that this infamous moment in life is not temporal, it is eternal. And thus began the beginning of the new race; a race within the race of humanity; a race which bears no prejudice, no judgment but boundless freedom. But on that same day as the eternal Mother hovered in the multiverse another, more terrifying, birth took place: the birth of evil\nAnd as she, herself, split into two, rotating in agony between two ultimate forces, the pendulum of choice began its dance. It seems easy, you imagine, to gravitate, instantly and unwaveringly, towards good but she wondered, “How can I protect something so perfect without evil?”", "Alphabetical Songs Sorted by Era:\n Denotes the song has not leaked in full\nSongs written as a child \n• Dollar Bills\n• To Love Again\nUnreleased Demo CD \n• If Only\n• In a Dream\n• Kisses are Quarters\n• Selfish Girl\nTeam Love Child’s Recording Sessions \n• Blueberry Kisses \n• Blueberry Kisses \n• Blueberry Kisses\n• Broken Drum Machine\n• Dirty Ice Cream \n• Dirty Ice Cream\n• Fancy Pants\n• Fever \n• Fever \n• Fever \n• Fever \n• Fooled Me Again \n• Glitter and Grease\n• Go, Go, Go\n• Kandy Life\n• Let Love Down\n• Love Sick Girl\n• Oh Baby\n• Oh Well\n• Reel Cool\n• Retrosexual\n• Ribbons\n• Rockshow \n• Rockshow \n• Rockshow\n• Sexy Ugly\n• Shake Ur Kitty\n• Spin U Around \n• Trigger\n• We Are Plastic \n• We Are Plastic \n• When She Go\n• Wonderful\n• Wundaland \n• Wundaland by Lina Morgana ft.

And do you find there’s a difference between your fans in different countries or is there a sort of similarity: is there a kind of Gaga fan who has a commonality?\nLG: Yes, there is. The little monsters are a community and it’s kind of nice that everywhere I go they create a little home for me.\nSF: Both those who, I suppose, describe themselves as your critics and those who adore you, as I do I’m unashamed to say, would concentrate on the fact that you are quite happy to be self consciously a spokesman for the dispossessed, the marginal, the freakish, the outsider, the sexually different, the ugly, the fat, the one who doesn’t fit in, the one who feels outside the tribe, if you like.\nLG: Yes, it could be anybody.\nSF: Which, in fact, is most of us. None of us really feels we belong, just some of us are better at hiding it than others.\nLG: I think so. Some of us wear the mask prouder than others.\nSF: Yes. Exactly. And the title of this album is the one that most directly addresses that, I suppose, Born This Way and the title song of it.\nLG: Yes.

know that you all have been feeling a tremendous range of emotions. Since weve all have heard about this horrible, hateful attack on Orlando and on your and our community. As we have now witnessed the largest mass shooting in American history. I cant help but feel that this level of hatred, like all predigital crimes, this is an attack on humanity itself. This is an attack on everyone. Tonight I gather humbly with you. As a human being: in peace, in sincerity, in commitment, in solidarity. To take a real moment and mourn the tragic loss of these innocent, beautiful people. And lets all today pledge an allegiance of love to them, and to their families, who are suffering so deeply. They are sons and daughters, theyre fathers and mothers, they are all our brothers and our sisters. But tonight I will not allow my anger and outrage over this attack to overshadow our need to honour those who are grieving truly for their lost ones. Lost members of the LGBT community. I hope you know that myself and so many are your allies. Not only me but everyone here, we represent the compassion and the loyalty of millions of people around the world that believe in you, you are not alone. You are not alone. Tomorrow I hope that we all raise thoughtfully and loudly towards solutions.
