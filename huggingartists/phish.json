And in the forest, there were birds and lakes and rocks and trees and rivers. The forest was also inhabited by a small group of people called the Lizards. The Lizards were simple people and they had lived in the forest undisturbed for thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility. Once a year when spring came and the first blossoms began to show, the Lizards would gather at the base of the mountain, to give thanks for all that they had. They thanked the birds and they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks and the trees and the rivers; but most importantly, they thanked Icculus\nIcculus lived on top of the mountain, or at least everyone thought so, for no one had actually ever seen him. But they knew he existed, because they had the Helping Friendly Book. Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book to the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift. It contained all of the knowledge inherent in the universe, and had enabled the Lizards to exist in harmony with nature for years. And so they lived, until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge. His name was Wilson and he quickly became intrigued by the Lizards way of life. He asked if he could stay on and live in the forest; and the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider, were happy to oblige\nWilson lived with the Lizards for a few years, studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book, and all was well. Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone. Wilson explained that he had hidden the book, knowing that the Lizards had become dependent on it for survival. He declared himself king and enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge. He cut down the trees and built a city, which he called Prussia. And in the center of the city he built a castle, and locked in the highest tower of the castle lay the Helping Friendly Book, out of the reach of the Lizards forever. But our story begins in a different time, not in Gamehendge, but on a suburban street in Long Island. And our hero is no king sitting in a castle; he is a retired colonel shaving in his bathroom\nColonel Forbin looked square in the mirror and dragged the blade across his cold creamed skin. He saw the tired little folds of flesh that lay in a heap beneath his eyes. Fifty-two years of obedient self-restraint, of hiding his tension behind a serene veil of composure. For fifty-two years he had piled it all on the back burner, and for fifty-two years it had boiled, frothing over in a turbulent storm inside of him. It had escaped through his eyes, reacting with the cigarette smoke and the fluorescent lights and slowly accumulating into a sagging mass. He ran his dripping palm across the stubble on the nape of his neck and thought again about the door\nHe had discovered the door some months back on one of his ritualistic morning walks with his dog McGrupp. It had started out as a typical stroll with McGrupp bounding joyously ahead of the preoccupied colonel. As they reached the apex of the hill, he saw it and he knew it had always been there, and felt foolish for overlooking the door for so long. At first, he tried to ignore it, but he soon found that it was impossible, and slowly his newly acquired knowledge transformed his dreary life into a prison from which there was only one escape. And on this morning, Colonel Forbin stepped through the door...", "As I found out that I\nHad a lot to learn\nIt turns out the tide\nHad to take its turn\nThe line we had drawn\nWasnt straight

grin stretched the folds of his pasty white cheeks\nAnd his lips hurled a dollop of murk on the curb\nAnd the lights from the rides showed a mischievous sparkle\nThat flashed in his hollow eyed stare\nHe said Little girl, you can chop off my legs\nAnd then peel off my socks if you want to\nBut Id rather you took this old puppet from me\nThat I hold in my pail as we speak\nAnd he stood looking down at the innocent girl\nAnd she stared at the bucket bewildered\nTil he lifted the doll for the young girl to see\nAnd a giant smile grew on his face\nShe saw the dolls eyes and she couldnt resist\nAnd she thanked the man quickly and ran to the church\nAnd she burst through the door with puppet held high\nAnd a hush filled the chapel, and the people looked mean\nEsther tried in vain to pacify the mob\nQuibble grew to spat, to wrangle, then to brawl\nThe frenzied congregation struggled desperately to fetch\nThe pretty puppet snugly nestled deep in Esthers leather sack\nThrough the window of the church a storm began to rage\nAnd Esther knew the time had come to flee\nShe scurried down the aisle toward the doorway in the distance\nAnd out into the rainstorm where she felt she would be free\nBut the wind was blowing harder and her skirt began to billow\nUntil finally her feet began to lift\nAnd she rose above the houses and the people and the chimneys\nAnd Esther and the doll were set adrift\nFloating higher over the hills\nAnd the valleys and treetops, theyd flutter and glide\nSoaring and turning suspended on air\nWith the earth far below them theyd tumble and dive\nThrough the clouds\nAnd she began to plummet earthward\nTill she landed in the nasty part of town\nShe glanced about the village, sure to find the evil men\nWho rob and pillage in the darkest hour of night\nNervously she fumbled for the pouch\nThat held the puppet on her rump\nFeeling quite outnumbered, Esther hid behind\nA nearby pile of lumber, where she waited till the dawn\nCause it would have been a blunder to succumb\nTo a hoodlum on the prowl\nWhen the morning came, she wandered through the streets\nAlong the chilly lake that lay beside the town\nAt last a peaceful moment, but she thought she heard a sound\nIt was an angry mob of joggers coming up to knock her down\nAs Esther stood and shook her head\nThe joggers were approaching\nAnd she knew she had no choice left but to swim\nAs the frosty water sank its bitter teeth into her hide\nShe tried to slide the heavy clothing from her skin\nNaked now she made her way toward the shore\nWhen suddenly she felt a tiny tugging at her toe\nAnd the puppet shed forgotten wrapped its tiny little arms\nAround her ankle and wouldnt let her go\nThe waves seemed to open and swallow her whole\nAs the doll pulled her down through the eerie green deep\nAnd the sound of the laughing old man filled her ears\nAs she drifted away to a tranquil and motionless sleep", "A day in the life of a waiter/addict with delusions of

The quest for the book had dragged on for so many years that its sudden appearance left the men staring in disbelief, unsure of what their next move should be\nThe shock wore off quickly though, and Errand Wolfe shot into high gear. He snatched up the book with one hand and the Famous Mockingbird with the other, and began to inform Rutherford of this plan. He would first kill Wilson, and then put the Helping Friendly Book to work for him\nWith Rutherfords aid he fastened the Famous Mockingbird to a pole, with glue and rubber bands, to insure the secrecy of his mission, and then set out to find the only man in Gamehendge who could handle the job of eliminating a King", "By that night, news of Palmers death had traveled back to the camp. Spirits were low and Colonel Forbin felt devastated. Even though he had only been in Gamehendge for one day, he had already developed a deep hatred for Wilson. He wanted desperately to help the revolutionaries, but without Palmer, it seemed hopeless\nHe wandered slowly through the camp and passed Errand Wolfe, sitting by the fire with Rutherford, who had returned that afternoon. He walked on and soon found himself outside of Telas hut. Forbin knocked and walked in. Tela sat behind a makeshift desk in the center of a room that was littered with small cages containing spotted stripers, a tiny three-legged breed of animal. The unit monster sat in the corner. The colonel took a step toward Tela and spoke. I needed to come here tonight, he said, to tell you that Ive fallen in love with you. He looked to her eyes for approval, but her face remained frozen in an expressionless stare\nAn awkward blanket of silence fell over the room and hung for a long moment before being shattered by the sound of the door swinging violently open. It was Rutherford the Brave. The ironclad knight rushed across the room and gripped the throats of Tela and the unit monster in each of his mighty hands. They struggled to break free but even the unit monster was no match for Rutherfords power and soon it was over. The bodies fell to the floor in a lifeless heap. Colonel Forbin stepped forward from where he stood in the corner, unable to contain his confusion and rage and screamed Wh?\nHis question was answered by Errand Wolfe who had quietly slipped through the doorway during the confusion. She was a spy, he said, and explained to Forbin that she had been sending information to Wilson using the spotted stripers as carriers. Rogers death had aroused his suspicion, and Palmers had confirmed it\nThe colonel stood in silence in a world that had turned up-side-down so many times that he no longer knew which way was up. It had all seemed so simple when he first arrived. Good versus evil, and of course he had sided with good as he had done all his life. And now, he stood and stared into the eyes of Errand Wolfe and he saw evil. The entire picture began to seem like an enormous puzzle with one piece missing, and the colonel knew what that piece was. Within twenty-four hours, he said to Errand Wolfe, you will have the Helping Friendly Book. And even as the words were leaving his lips, he found himself running out the door and into the forest, not towards Prussia, but toward the great mountain looming in the distance", "Verse:]\nTime is

And in the forest there were birds and lakes and rocks and trees and rivers. The forest was also inhabited by a small group of people called the lizards. The lizards were a simple people and they had lived in the forest undisturbed for thousands of years in utter peace and tranquillity. Once a year when spring came, and the first blossoms began to show, the lizards would gather at the base of the mountain, to give thanks for all that they had. They thanked the birds and they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks and the trees and the rivers; but most importantly, they thanked Icculus. Icculus lived at the top of the mountain, or at least everyone thought so, for no one had actually ever seen him. But they knew he existed, because they had the Helping Friendly Book. Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book to the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift. It contained all of the knowledge inherent in the universe, and had enabled the Lizards to exist in harmony with nature for years. And so they lived; until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge. His name was Wilson and he quickly became intrigued by the Lizards way of life. He asked if he could stay on and live in the forest; and the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider, were happy to oblige. Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years, studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book, and all was well. Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone. Wilson explained that he had hidden the book, knowing that the Lizards had become dependent on it for survival. He declared himself king and enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge. He cut down the trees and built a city, which he called Prussia. And in the center of the city he built a castle, and locked in the highest tower of the castle lay the Helping Friendly Book out of the reach of the Lizards forever. But our story begins at a different time, not in Gamehendge, but on a suburban street in Long Island, and our hero is no king sitting in a castle, he is a retired colonel shaving in his bathroom\nColonel Forbin looked square in the mirror and dragged the blade across his cold creamed skin. He saw the tired little folds of flesh that lay in a heap beneath his eyes. Fifty-two years of obedient self-restraint, of hiding his tension behind a serene veil of composure. For fifty-two years he had piled it all on the back burner, and for fifty-two years it had boiled, frothing over in a turbulent storm inside of him. It had escaped through his eyes, reacting with the cigarette smoke and the fluorescent lights and slowly accumulating into a sagging mass. He ran his dripping palm across the stubble on the nape of his neck and thought again about the door. He had discovered the door some months back on one of his ritualistic morning walks with his dog McGrupp. It had started out as a typical stroll with McGrupp bounding joyously ahead of the preoccupied colonel. As they reached the apex of the hill, he saw it and he knew it had always been there, and felt foolish for overlooking the door for so long. At first, he tried to ignore it, but he soon found that it was impossible, and slowly his newly acquired knowledge transformed his dreary life into a prison from which there was only one escape. And on this morning, Colonel Forbin stepped through the door", "I read the news today\nAbout a lucky man who made the grade\nAnd though the news was rather sad\nWell, I just had to laugh\nI saw the
