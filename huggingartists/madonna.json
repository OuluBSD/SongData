taken me so long to get back to you. I recieved your letter in NY but I had to leave for Mich, which is where I am right now. I have thought long and hard about what I want to do with our songs, my record, the sound, the vibe etc. I had always intended to do a portion of the record with Nellie Hooper because I like the sound of all of his records and I think he has really good instincts. Then I thought about doing the rest of the record with you not really thinking what the divide would be. This is where my head was at when I left Miami. Then I started thinking about how I didnt want a record that sounds like two different producers worked on it. I allready had that nightmare experience. Then i started leaning towards Nellie doing the whole thing because hes not a song writer and I thought he would treat all songs fairly without favortism and ego involved. I sent all my demos to Nellie to listen to and while he gave it up to a few he made some disturbing remarks about how he was going to have to change the music so much he would want a writers credit. Which of course made me sick. EGO-EGO-EGO!!!! When I was in NY I had to meet with William Orbit which has you know were trying to do a deal with and he played me more tracks that blew my mind and I mentioned that I would like to write with him and he said he had studio time and why not tomorrow? To make a long story short we ended up doing several tracks together that I absolutely adore and more importantly I love his sound. Suddenly i felt like he knew what direction I wanted to go musically . I havent formally asked him to produce my album but Im going to and I wanted you to know first. I know he will be gobsmacked and humble and eager to please which is not to say that you arent but I really feel strongly about taking a new direction and Williams sound is a complete departure. After making so many records its what I need to get my blood boiling. I hope you will not be insulted or take offense by this decision. I loved working with you again. Youre a brilliant musician/songwriter and I have the utmost respect for you. On top of all that I adore you. You did say you were cool with any decision I made. Obviously if we use any of your programs you will be compensated. I may use a rough vocal or two and I havent decided if I will use all the songs we wrote. I will keep you posted on everything. I will probably be working all of July and August and September. In any case these are my thoughts for now.

wanna uhm, I wanna say thank you to Labyrinth, that was an amazing, amazing performance. Can I put this down? Sorry, seriously. Its better this way. Ahh, I always feel better with something hard between my legs.\nI stand before you as a doormat. Oh, I mean, as a female entertainer. Thank you for acknowledging my ability to continue my career for 34 years in the face of blatant misogyny, sexism, constant bullying and relentless abuse. When I started there was no internet, so people had to say it to my face. There were very few people I had to clap back at because life was simpler then.\nWhen I first moved to New York, I was a teenager. It was 1979 and New York was a very scary place. In the first year I was held at gunpoint, raped on a rooftop with a knife digging into my throat and I had my apartment broken into and robbed so many times I just stopped locking the door. In the years to follow, I lost almost every friend I had to AIDS or drugs or gunshot. People were dying of AIDS everywhere. It wasn’t safe to be gay, it wasn’t cool to be associated with the gay community.\nAs you can imagine, all these unexpected events not only helped me become the daring woman that stands before you, but it also reminded me that Im vulnerable. And in life there is no real safety except self-belief. And an understanding that Im not the owner of my talents. Im not the owner of anything. Everything I have is a gift from God. And even the shitty fucked up things that happened to me, that still happen to me, are also gifts to teach me lessons and make me stronger.\nIm receiving an award for being woman of the year, so I ask myself what can I say about being a woman in the music business? What can I say about being a woman?.\nWhen I first started writing songs, I didnt think in a gender-specific way. I didnt think about feminism. I just wanted to be an artist. I was of course inspired by Debbie Harry and Chrissie Hynde and Aretha Franklin, but my real muse was David Bowie. He embodied male and female spirit and that suited me just fine. He made me think there were no rules. But I was wrong. There are no rules - if youre a boy.\nIf youre a girl, you have to play the game. What is that game? Youre allowed to be pretty and cute and sexy. But don’t act too smart. Don’t have an opinion. Dont have an opinion that is out of line with the status quo at least. You are allowed to be objectified by men and dress like a slut, but don’t own your sluttiness. And do not, I repeat do not, share your own sexual fantasies with the world. Be what men want you to be, but more importantly, be what women feel comfortable with you being around other men. And finally, do not age. Because to age is a sin. You will be criticized. You will be vilified. And you will definitely not be played on the radio.\nWhen I first became famous, there were nude photos of me in Playboy and Penthouse magazine. Photos that were taken from art schools where I posed for back in the day to make money. They werent very sexy. In fact I looked quite bored. I was. But I was expected to feel ashamed when these photos came out, but I was not. And this puzzled people.\nEventually I was left alone because I married Sean Penn, and not only would he would bust a cap in your ass, but I was off the market. So for a while I was not considered a threat. Years later, divorced and single - sorry, Sean - I made my Erotica album and my Sex book was released. I remember being the headline of every newspaper and magazine. And everything I read about myself was damning. I was called a whore and a witch. One headline compared me to Satan. I said, Wait a minute, isnt Prince running around with fishnets and high heels and lipstick with his butt hanging out? Yes, he was. But he was a man. This was the first time I truly understood that women really did not have the same freedom as men.\nI remember feeling paralyzed. It took me a while to pull myself together and get on with my creative life. Get on with my life. I took comfort in the poetry of Maya Angelou, and the writings of James Baldwin, and in the music of Nina Simone.\nI remember wishing that I had a female peer I could look to for support. Camille Paglia, the famous feminist writer, said that I set women back by objectifying myself sexually. Oh, I thought, so if youre a feminist, you dont have sexuality, you deny it. So I said fuck it. Im a different kind of feminist. Im a bad feminist.\nPeople say that Im so controversial. But I think the most controversial thing I have ever done is to stick around. Michael is gone. Tupac is gone. Prince is gone. Whitney is gone. Amy Winehouse is gone. David Bowie is gone. But Im still standing. Im one of the lucky ones and every day I count my blessings.\nWhat I would like to say to all women here today is this: Women have been so oppressed for so long, they believe what men have to say about them. And they believe they have to back a man to get the job done. And there are some very good men worth backing, but not because theyre men - because theyre worthy. As women, we have to start appreciating our own worth and each others worth. Seek out strong women to befriend, to align yourself with, to learn from, to be inspired by, to collaborate with, to support, to be enlightened by.\nAs I said before, its not so much about receiving this award as it is having this opportunity to stand before you and really say thank you, as a woman, as an artist, as a human. Not only to the people who have loved and supported me along the way, you have no idea... you have no idea how much your support means.\nBut to the doubters and naysayers and everyone who gave me hell and said I could not, that I would not, that I must not - your resistance made me stronger, made me push harder, made me the fighter that I am today. Made me the woman that I am today.

People all over the world are suffering and people are afraid, and what happens when people are afraid? They become intolerant. They start pointing the finger at other people. They say, “You’re the reason. You’re the problem. You’re to blame. Get out!” The enemy is not out there. The еnemy is within.\nAll you need for a movie is a gun and a girl. - Jean-Luc Godard\nI did my tour of duty this yеar, and it feels like I’ve been to hell and back. I saw many things I did not like. I saw apathy. I saw intolerance. I saw desperation and poverty. I saw discrimination and bigotry, and a kind of sinister black cloud of hypocrisy moving in on me, like a curtain of despair. Yeah, that’s right. I saw a lack of desire like a plague, putting everyone into a kind of a trance. And I looked into the eyes of people and I saw helplessness. I saw hopelessness. I saw humans searching for a way out. Another new and exciting distractio. An excuse to do nothing. An external enemy to blame.\nBut I also saw people desperate for a way in, looking for guidance, looking for inspiration, for hope. Looking for love. I keep telling everyone that I want to start a revolution, but no one is taking me seriously. If I had black skin and an afro, would you take me seriously? If I was an Arab waving a hand grenade, would you take me seriously? If I was wearing combat gear and I had an AK-47 strapped to my back, would you take me seriously?\nInstead, I’m a woman. I’m a blonde. I have tits and an ass, and an insatiable desire to be noticed. “Come on, baby. Show us your ass. Shake it for us, baby. Do that dance you do so well for us, baby.” And some people like it when I show my ass. And some people think it’s obscene. Judgment over compassion, and fear over love. And that is obscene.\nOk, but I still want to start a revolution. Somebody’s got to. There’s too much beauty in the world going to waste. Too much talent going unnoticed. Too much creativity crushed beneath the wheel of corporate branding and what’s trending.\nBut it’s time to wake up before it’s too late. History’s repeating itself. Don’t you see a pattern here? We live in a very scary time. Or should I say, we don’t really live at all?\nDemocracy doesn’t seem to exist anymore. Freedom of expression sounds like a catchphrase. And if you want to be an artist in this day and age, you better have strong arms. You better be prepared to swim upstream in shark-infested waters. You better have thick skin. Because when those Fascist dictators posing as righteous men come for you with their big leather boots to shut you up, to put a gag in your mouth, to send you away to a penal colony, you better be prepared to fight for what you believe in. I used to think I had thick skin, but right now, it feels like I have no skin, like I have been skinned alive. You better be prepared to die for what you believe in.\n“…in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand signed the Emancipation Proclamation…”\n“I think… I think he has no one to … to help him. I guess I’m… I’m lost. I just feel I need to… to create some… some frame in my mind, you know? To not feel so lonely.”\nI don’t sleep anymore. I’ve lost my appetite. I don’t feel safe. Lots of people don’t feel safe. That’s why I want to start a revolution. But this revolution will not be televised. It will not be on the Internet. It won’t be an app available on your iPhone. You won’t be able to download it.\nThis will be the revolution of thinking for yourself, of having your own opinion and not giving a damn what people say. This will be a revolution of inquiring further, of not worrying about winning other people’s approval, of not wishing you were someone else, but perfectly content to be who you are, someone unique and rare and fearless.\nI want to start a revolution of love.\nAnd this revolution will overcome all fear and all suffering and all separation. And it will include all people. Black, white, Christian, Chinese, Muslim, Jew, gay, straight, bisexual, fat, thin, handicapped, rich, poor, artistic and autistic. Fuck labels. I hate labels. We’re all in this ship together, sailing like a burning sphere across the sea. Burn, baby, burn.\nMy country, ‘tis of thee. Sweet land of liberty. Land where my fathers died. Land of the pilgrim’s pride.\nI feel that people are becoming more and more afraid of people who are different. People are becoming more and more intolerant!\nWe want to fight for the right to be free! To be who we are! Yes! Yes!\nThis is a very scary time, but we can make a difference! We can change this! We have the power! And we don’t have to do it with violence. We just have to do it with love. Jesus preached this. Muhammad preached this. Buddha preached this. Moses preached this. It’s in every holy book. Love thy neighbor as thyself, ok? So, you cannot use religion to treat other people badly. You cannot use God’s name to treat other people badly. We all deserve love.\nI feel naked and alone. I’m sure you can relate. Sometimes I want to beat myself up. Sometimes I say to myself, “Why didn’t I wait? Why did I listen to all those voices in my head? Why didn’t I have patience? Why did I let all that doubt into my head? Into my belief system? Why?”\nI know what you’re thinking. “If you can’t take the heat, get out of the kitchen.” But it’s too late. I am in the kitchen, and the burner’s on full blaze.\nI want to start a revolution. Are you with me?\n“Land where my fathers died. Land of the pilgrim’s pride. From every mountain side. Let freedom ring.”\nFreedom is what you do with what’s been done to you. - Jean-Paul Sartre\nThis film is dedicated to those who have been persecuted, are being persecuted, or may be persecuted.
