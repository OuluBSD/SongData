This note should be pretty easy to understand\nAll the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I havent felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things\nFor example when were back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins, it doesnt affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I cant fool you, any one of you. It simply isnt fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if Im having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. Ive tried everything within my power to appreciate it . I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when theyre gone. Im too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child\nOn our last 3 tours, Ive had a much better appreciation for all the people Ive known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still cant get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. Theres good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why dont you just enjoy it? I dont know!\nI have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I cant stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that Ive become\nI have it good, very good, and Im grateful, but since the age of seven, Ive become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy.

etcetera...\nThis tipical pubescent problem was in effect during the height of my problems with my father and stepmom\nYou know, the tipical wicked-stepmom story\nAnd so, I moved to both grandparents and four sets of aunts and uncles\nand so forth and so on within the year\nAnd in eighth grade, my mom had no choice to take me in because my dad packed my stuff\nand drove me to her house in the

from\nHe was the kingpin\nTrevor, Ace, John and Derren\nAll white-trash, lowlife scums of the Earth According to the jocks, had been going to this girls house after school, and they invited me\nWe got to the door and a very fat girl let us in\nIt wasnt obvious to me for over an hour that this girl seemed kind of quiet\nUntil one of the guys pointed out that she was in a special ed class\nIm sure a lot of kids would call her a retard and some just slow\nAnd at the time, and still to this day, I would call her quiet and illiterate but not retarded\nThe object of the guys who had be going there for the past month was to steal booze from the downstairs basement den of her house\nWhile others distracted her by opening covers and doors and pretending to eat all the food\nOne would go down and take a fifth and then exit out the downstairs\nSo wed do this routine every otherday and got away with it for, oh, about a month\nAnd during that month it happened to be the epitome of my mental abuse from my mother\nIt turned out that pot didnt help me escape my troubles too well anymore\nand I was actually enjoying doing rebellious things like stealing booze and busting store windows and-\nAnd nothing ever mattered\nI decided within the next month, Ill not sit on my roof and think about jumping\nBut Ill actually kill myself\nAnd I wasnt going out from this world without actually knowing what it was like to get laid\nSo one day after school I went to the girls house alone\nAnd invited myself in and she offered me some Twinkies\nAnd I sat on her lap and I said\nLets fuck\nAnd I touched

However, the Lord and Julian Cope himself know how we need, need, need, the NME to embrace the unifying hands of our children across this big blue marble and NIRVANAs tarty musical career. So please bless us again -- well forever feed off of your high-calorie boggy turbinates\nIn an attempt to satisfy the second part of my quest, I went to the Rough Trade shop and, of course, found no Raincoats record in the bin. I then asked the woman behind the counter about it and she said well, it happens that Im neighbors with Anna and she works at an antique shop just a few miles from here. So she drew me a map and I started on my way to Annas\nSometime later, I arrived at this elfin shop filled with something else Ive compulsively searched for over the past few years -- really old fucked up marionette-like wood carved dolls . Lots of them... Ive fantasized about finding a shop filled with so many. They wouldnt accept my credit card but the dolls were really way too expensive anyway. Anna was there, however, so I politely introduced myself with a fever-red face and explained the reason for my intrusion. I can remember her mean boss almost setting me on fire with his glares. She said well, I may have a few lying around so, if I find one, Ill send it to you . I left feeling like a dork, like I had violated her space, like she probably thought my band was tacky\nA few weeks later I received a vinyl copy of that wonderfully classic scripture with a personalized dust sleeve covered with xeroxed lyrics, pictures, and all the members signatures. There was also a touching letter from Anna. It made me happier than playing in front of thousands of people each night, rock-god idolization from fans, music industry plankton kissing my ass, and the million dollars I made last year. It was one of the few really important things that Ive been blessed with since becoming an untouchable boy genius\nIt was as rewarding as touring with Shonen Knife and watching people practically cry with joy at their honesty. It made people happy and it made me happy knowing that I had helped bring them to the UK\nIt was as rewarding as the last Vaselines show in Edinburgh. They reformed just to play with us in their home town, probably having no idea how exciting and flattering it was for us \nIt was as rewarding as being asked to support Sonic Youth on two tours, totally being taken under their wing and being showed what dignity really means\nIt was as rewarding as the drawings Daniel Johnston sent me, or the Stinky Puffs single from Jad Fairs son, or playing on the same bill as Greg Sage in L.A., or being asked to help produce the next Melvins record, or being on the Wipers compilation, or Thor from T.K. giving me a signed first edition of Naked Lunch, or making a friend like Stephen Pavlovic -- our Australian tour promoter who sent me a Mazzy Star LP on vinyl, or playing The Money Will Roll Right In with Mudhoney, or having the power to insist on bringing Bjorn Again to the Reading Festival, or being able to afford to bring my friend Ian along on tour just to have a good time, or paying Calamity Jane five-thousand dollars to be heckled by twenty thousand macho boys in Argentina, or asking my friends Fits Of Depression to play with us at The Seattle Coliseum, or playing with Poison Idea at a No On Nine benefit in Portland organzied by Gus Van Zandt, or being a part of oen of L7s pro-choice benefits in L.A., or kissing Chris and Dave on Saturday Night Live just to spite the homophobes, or meeting Iggy Pop, or playing with The Breeders, Urge Overkill, the T.V. Personalities, The Jesus Lizard, Hole, Dinosour Jr., etc\nWhile all these things were very special, none were half as rewarding as having a baby with a person who is the supreme example of dignity, ethics and honesty. My wife challenges injustice and the reason her character has been so severely attacked is because she chooses not to function the way the white corporate man insists. His rules for women involve her being submissive, quiet, and non-challenging. When she doesnt follow his rules, the threatened man gets scared\nA big fuck you to those of you who have the audacity to claim that Im so naive and stupid that I would allow myself to be taken advantage of and manipulated\nI dont feel the least bit guilty for commericially exloiting a completely exhausted Rock youth Culture because, at this point in rock history, Punk Rock is, to me, dead and gone. We just wanted to pay tribute to something that helped us to feel as though we had crawled out of the dung heap of conformity. To pay tribute like an Elvis or Jimi Hendrix impersonator in the tradition of a bar band. Ill be the first to admit that were the 90s version of Cheap Trick or the Knack but the last to admit that it hasnt been rewarding\nAt this point I have a request for our fans.

Tonight’s concert — Nirvana’s second of two nights at the Aragon, only a week into the band’s first U.S. tour in two years — is a real stinker. The venues cavernous sound turns even corrosive torpedoes like Breed and Territorial Pissings into riff pudding, and Cobain is bedeviled all night by guitar- and vocal- monitor problems. There are moments of prickly brilliance: Cobain’s sandpaper howl cutting through the Aragon’s canyonlike echo in the tense explosive chorus of Heart-Shaped Box; a short stunning Sliver with torrid power strumming by guest touring guitarist Pat Smear . But there is no Smells Like Teen Spirit, and when the house lights go up, so does a loud chorus of boos.\nAccording to the Cobain press myth — pissy, complaining, freaked-out schizophrenic, as he quite accurately puts it — the 26-year-old singer and guitarist should have fired the soundman, canceled this interview and gone back to his hotel room to sulk. Instead, he spends his wind-down time backstage, doting on his daughter, 1-year-old Frances Bean Cobain, a petite blond beauty who barrels around the room with a smile for everyone in her path. Later, back at the hotel, armed with nothing stronger than a pack of cigarettes and two minibar bottles of Evian water, Cobain is in a thoughtful, discursive mood, taking great pains to explain that success doesn’t really suck —not as much as it used to, anyway — and that his life is pretty good. And getting better.\nIt was so fast and explosive, he says in a sleepy, gravelly voice of his first crisis of confidence following the ballistic success of Nevermind. I didn’t know how to deal with it. If there was a Rock Star 101 course, I would have liked to take it. It might have helped me.\nI still see stuff, descriptions of rock stars in some magazine — ‘Sting, the environmental guy and Kurt Cobain, the whiny, complaining, neurotic, bitchy guy who hates everything, hates rock stardom, hates his life.’ And Ive never been happier in my life. Especially within the last week, because the shows have been going so well — except for tonight. Im a much happier guy than a lot of people think I am.\nCobain took some long, hard detours to get there over the past year. The making of In Utero, Nirvana’s long-awaited studio follow-up to Nevermind, was fraught with last-minute title and track changes as well as a public scrap between the band, its record label, DGC, and producer Steve Albini over the album’s commercial potential — or lack thereof. Cobain’s marriage to punk-noir singer Courtney Love of the band Hole — dream fodder for rock gossips since the couple exchanged vows in February 1992 — made headlines again last June when Cobain was arrested by Seattle police for allegedly assaulting Love during a domestic fracas. Police found three guns in the house, but no charges were filed, and the case was dismissed.\nLast year, Cobain also made a clean breast of his long-rumored heroin addiction, claiming he’d used the drug — at least in part — to opiate severe, chronic stomach pain. Or as he puts it in this interview, to medicate myself. He’s now off the junk, and thanks to new medication and a better diet, his digestive tract, he says, is on the road to recovery.\nBut the roots of his angst, public and personal, go much deeper. Born in the logging town of Aberdeen, Wash., Cobain is — like Nirvana’s bassist, Krist Novoselic, drummer Dave Grohl and a high percentage of the band’s young fans — the product of a broken home, the son of an auto mechanic and a secretary who divorced when he was 8. Cobain had early aspirations as a commercial artist and won a number of high-school art contests; he now designs much of Nirvana’s artwork. But after graduation, Cobain passed on an art-school scholarship and took up the teen-age-bum life, working as a roadie for the local punk band the Melvins and applying himself to songwriting.\nI never wanted to sing, Cobain insists now. I just wanted to play rhythm guitar — hide in the back and just play. But during those high-school years when I was playing guitar in my bedroom, I at least had the intuition that I had to write my own songs.\nFor a long time, after Nirvana catapulted from junior Sub Pop-label signees to grunge supergods —they won the Best Band and Best Album trophies in our 1994 Critics Poll — Cobain could not decide whether his talent was a blessing or a curse. He has finally come to realize it’s a bit of both. He is bugged that people think of him more as an icon than a songwriter yet fears that In Utero marks the finish line of the Nirvana sound crystallized in Smells Like Teen Spirit. Cobain remains deeply mistrustful of the music business but says he has done a complete U-turn on his attitude toward Nirvana’s mass punk-wanna-be flock.\nI don’t have as many judgments about them as I used to, Cobain says, almost apologetically. Ive come to terms about why they’re there and why we’re here. It doesn’t bother me anymore to see this Neanderthal with a mustache, out of his mind, drunk, singing along to ‘Sliver.’ That blows my mind now.\nIve been relieved of so much pressure in the last year and a half, Cobain says with discernible relief in his voice. Im still kind of mesmerized by it. He ticks off the reasons for his content: Pulling this record off. My family. My child. Meeting William Burroughs and doing a record with him.\nJust little things that no one would recognize or care about, he continues. And it has a lot to do with this band. If it wasn’t for this band, those things never would have happened. Im really thankful, and every month I come to more optimistic conclusions.\nI just hope, Cobain adds, grinning I don’t become so blissful I become boring. I think I’ll always be neurotic enough to do something weird.\nDavid Fricke: Along with everything else that went wrong onstage tonight, you left without playing Smells Like Teen Spirit. Why?\nKurt Cobain: That would have been the icing on the cake . That would have made everything twice as worse. I don’t even remember the guitar solo on Teen Spirit It would take me five minutes to sit in the catering room and learn the solo. But Im not interested in that kind of stuff. I don’t know if that’s so lazy that I don’t care anymore or what. I still like playing Teen Spirit, but it’s almost an embarrassment to play it.\nDF: In what way? Does the enormity of its success still bug you?\nKC: Yeah. Everyone has focused on that song so much. The reason it gets a big reaction is people have seen it on MTV a million times. It’s been pounded into their brains. But I think there are so many other songs that i’ve written that are as good, if not better, than that song, like Drain You. That’s definitely as good as Teen Spirit. I love the lyrics, and I never get tired of playing it. Maybe if it was as big as Teen Spirit, I wouldn’t like it as much. But I can barely, especially on a bad night like tonight, get through Teen Spirit. I literally want to throw my guitar down and walk away. I can’t pretend to have a good time playing it.\nDF: But you must have had a good time writing it.\nKC: We’d been practicing for about three months. We were waiting to sign to DGC, and Dave and I were living in Olympia , and Krist was living in Tacoma . We were driving up to Tacoma every night for practice, trying to write songs. I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it . When I heard the Pixies for the first rime, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band — or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard. ‘Teen Spirit was such a clichéd riff. It was so close to a Boston riff or Louie, Louie. When I came up with the guitar part, Krist looked at me and said, That is so ridiculous. I made the band play it for an hour and a half.\nDF: Where did the line Here we are now, entertain us come from?\nKC: That came from something I used to say every time I used to walk into a party to break the ice. A lot of times, when you’re standing around with people in a room, it’s really boring and uncomfortable. So it was Well, here we are, entertain us. You invited us here.\nDF: How did it feel to watch something you’d written in fun, in homage to one of your favorite bands, become the grunge national anthem, not to mention a defining moment in youth marketing?\nKC: Actually, we did have our own thing for a while. For a few years in Seattle, it was the Summer of Love, and it was so great. To be able to just jump out on top of the crowd with my guitar and be held up and pushed to the back of the room, and then brought back with no harm done to me — it was a celebration of something that no one could put their finger on. But once it got into the mainstream, it was over. I’m just tired of being embarrassed by it. Im beyond that.\nDF: This is the first US tour you’ve done since the fall of ‘91, just before Nevermind exploded. Why did you stay off the road for so long?\nKC: I needed time to collect my thoughts and readjust. It hit me so hard, and I was under the impression that I didn’t really need to go on tour, because I was making a whole bunch of money. Millions of dollars. Eight million to 10 million records sold — that sounded like a lot of money to me. So I thought I would sit back and enjoy it. I don’t want to use this as an excuse, and it’s come up so many times, but my stomach ailment has been one of the biggest barriers that stopped us from touring. I was dealing with it for a long time. But after a person experiences chronic pain for five years, by the time that fifth year ends, you’re literally insane. I couldn’t cope with anything. I was as schizophrenic as a wet cat that’s been beaten.\nDF: How much of that physical pain do you think you channeled into your songwriting?\nKC: That’s a scary question, because obviously if a person is having some kind of turmoil in their lives, it’s usually reflected in the music, and sometimes it’s pretty beneficial. I think it probably helped. But I would give up everything to have good health. I wanted to do this interview after we’d been on tour for a while, and so far, this has been the most enjoyable tour I’ve ever had. Honestly. It has nothing to do with the larger venues or people kissing our asses more. It’s just that my stomach isn’t bothering me anymore. Im eating. I ate a huge pizza last night. It was so nice to be able to do that. And it just raises my spirits. But then again, I was always afraid that if I lost the stomach problem, I wouldn’t be as creative. Who knows? I don’t have any new songs right now. Every album we’ve done so far, we’ve always had one to three songs left over from the sessions. And they usually have been pretty good, ones that we really liked, so we always had something to rely on — a hit or something that was above average. So this next record is going to be really interesting, because I have absolutely nothing left. Im starting from scratch for the first time. I don’t know what we’re going to do.\nDF: One of the songs that you cut from In Utero at the last minute was I Hate Myself and I Want to Die. How literally did you mean it?\nKC: As literal as a joke can be. Nothing more than a joke. And that had a bit to do with why we decided to take it off. We knew people wouldn’t get it; they’d take it too seriously. It was totally satirical, making fun of ourselves. Im thought of as this pissy, complaining, freaked-out schizophrenic who wants to kill himself all the time. He isn’t satisfied with anything. And I thought it was a funny title. I wanted it to be the title of the album for a long time. But I knew the majority of the people wouldn’t understand it.\nDF: Have you ever been that consumed with distress or pain or rage that you actually wanted to kill yourself?\nKC: For five years during the time I had my stomach problem, yeah. I wanted to kill myself every day. I came very close many times. Im sorry to be so blunt about it. It was to the point where I was on tour, lying on the floor, vomiting air because I couldn’t hold down water. And then I had to play a show in 20 minutes. I would sing and cough up blood. This is no way to live a life. I love to play music, but something was not right. So I decided to medicate myself. Even as satire, though, a song like that can bit a nerve. There are plenty of kids out there who, for whatever reasons, really do feel suicidal. That pretty much defines our band. It’s both those contradictions. It’s satirical, and it’s serious at the same time.\nDF: What kind of mail do you get from your fans these days?\nKC: I used to read the mail a lot, and I used to be really involved with it. But I’ve been so busy with this record, the video, the tour, that I haven’t even bothered to look at a single letter, and I feel really bad about it. I haven’t even been able to come up with enough energy to put out our fanzine, which was one of the things we were going to do to combat all the bad press, just to be able to show a more realistic side of the band. But it’s really hard. I have to admit I’ve found myself doing the same things that a lot of other rock stars do or are forced to do. Which is not being able to respond to mail, not being able to keep up on current music, and I’m pretty much locked away a lot. The outside world is pretty foreign to me. I feel very, very lucky to be able to go out to a club. Just the other night, we had a night off in Kansas City, deal Mo., and Pat and I had no idea where we were or where to go. So we called up the local college radio station and asked them what was going on. And they didn’t know! So we happened to call this bar, and the Treepeople from Seattle were playing. And it turns out I met three really, really nice people there, totally cool kids that were in bands. I really had a good time with them, all night. I invited them back to the hotel. They stayed there. I ordered room service for them. I probably went overboard, trying to be accommodating. But it was really great to know that I can still do that, that I can still find friends. And I didn’t think that would be possible. A few years ago, we were in Detroit, playing at this club, and about 10 people showed up. And next door, there was this bar, and Axl Rose came in with 10 or 15 bodyguards. It was this huge extravaganza; all these people were fawning over him. If he’d just walked in by himself, it would have been no big deal. But he wanted that. You create attention to attract attention.\nDF: Where do you stand on Pearl Jam now? There were rumors that you and Eddie Vedder were supposed to be on that Time magazine cover together.\nKC: I don’t want to get into that. One of the things I’ve learned is that slagging off people just doesn’t do me any good. It’s too bad, because the whole problem with the feud between Pearl Jam and Nirvana had been going on for so long and has come so close to being fixed.\nDF: It’s never been entirely clear what this feud with Vedder was about.\nKC: There never was one. I slagged them off because I didn’t like their band. I hadn’t met Eddie at the time. It was my fault; I should have been slagging off the record company instead of them. They were marketed — not probably against their will — but without them realizing they were being pushed into the grunge bandwagon.\nDF: Don’t you feel any empathy with them? They’ve been under the same intense follow-up-album pressure as you have.\nKC: Yeah, I do. Except I’m pretty sure that they didn’t go out of their way to challenge their audience as much as we did with this record. They’re a safe rock band. They’re a pleasant rock band that everyone likes. God, I’ve had much better quotes in my head about this. It just kind of pisses me off to know that we work really hard to make an entire album’s worth of songs that are as good as we can make them. I’m gonna stroke my ego by saying that we’re better than a lot of bands our there. What I’ve realized is that you only need a couple of catchy songs on an album, and the rest can be bull shit Bad Company rip-offs, and it doesn’t matter. If I was smart, I would have saved most of the songs off Nevermind and spread them out over a 15-year period. But I can’t do that. All the albums I ever liked were albums that delivered a great song, one after another: Aerosmith’s Rocks, the Sex Pistols’ Never Mind the Bollocks…, Led Zeppelin II, Back in Black, by AC/DC.\nDF: You’ve also gone on record as being a big Beatles fan.\nKC: Oh, yeah. John Lennon was definitely my favorite Beatle, hands down. I don’t know who wrote what parts of what Beatles songs, but Paul McCarrney embarrasses me. Lennon was obviously disturbed . So I could relate to that. And from the books I’ve read — and I’m so skeptical of anything I read, especially in rock books — I just felt really sorry for him. To be locked up in that apartment. Although he was totally in love with Yoko and his child, his life was a prison He was imprisoned. It’s not fair. That’s the crux of the problem that I’ve had with becoming a celebrity — the way people with celebrities. It needs to be changed; it really does. No matter how hard you try, it only comes our like you’re bitching about it. I can understand how a per- son can feel that way and almost become obsessed with it. But it’s so hard to convince people to mellow out. Just take it easy, have a little bit of respect. We all shit .\nDF: In Utero may be the most anticipated, talked-about and argued-over album of 1993. Didn’t you feel at any point during all the title changes and the press hoopla stirred up by Steve Albini that the whole thing was just getting stupid? After all, it is just an album.\nKC: Yeah. But I’m used to it . While making the record, that wasn’t happening. It was made really fast. All the basic tracks were done within a week. And I did 80 percent of the vocals in one day, in about seven hours. I just happened to be on a roll. It was a good day for me, and I just kept going.\nDF: So what was the problem?\nKC: It wasn’t the songs. It was the production. It took a very, very long time for us to realize what the problem was. We couldn’t figure it out. We had no idea why we didn’t feel the same energy that we did from Nevermind. We finally came to the conclusion that the vocals weren’t loud enough, and the bass was totally inaudible. We couldn’t hear any notes that Krist was playing at all. I think there are a few songs on In Utero that could have been cleaned up a little bit more. Definitely Penny Royal Tea. That was not recorded right. There is something wrong with that. That should have been recorded like Nevermind, because I know that’s a strong song, a hit single. We’re toying with the idea of re-recording it or remixing it. You hit and miss. It’s a really weird thing about this record. I’ve never been more confused in my life, but at the same time I’ve never been more satisfied with what we’ve done.\nDF: Let’s talk about your songwriting. Your best songs —Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Rape Me, Penny Royal Tea— all open with the verse in a low, moody style. Then the chorus comes in at full volume and nails you. So which comes first, the verse or the killer chorus?\nKC: I don’t know. I really don’t know. I guess I start with the verse and then go into the chorus. But I’m getting so tired of that formula. And it is formula. And there’s not much you can do with it. We’ve mastered that — for our band. We’re all growing pretty tired of it. It is a dynamic style. But I’m only using two of the dynamics. There are a lot more I could be using. Krist, Dave and I have been working on this formula — this thing of going from quiet to loud — for so long that it’s literally becoming boring for us. It’s like OK, I have this riff. I’ll play it quiet, without a distortion box, while I’m singing the verse. And now let’s turn on the distortion box and hit the drums harder. I want to learn to go in between those things, go back and forth, almost become psychedelic in a way but with a lot more structure. It’s a really hard thing to do, and I don’t know if we’re capable of it — as musicians.\nDF: Songs like Dumb and All Apologies do suggest that you’re looking for a way to get to people without resorting to the big-bang guitar effect.\nKC: Absolutely. I wish we could have written a few more songs like those on all the other albums. Even to put About a Girl on Bleach was a risk. I was heavily into pop, I really liked R.E.M., and I was into all kinds of old ‘60s stuff. But there was a lot of pressure within that social scene, the underground — like the kind of thing you get in high school. And to put a jangly R.E.M. type of pop song on a grunge record, in that scene, was risky. We have failed in showing the lighter, more dynamic side of our band. The big guitar sound is what the kids want to hear. We like playing that stuff, but I don’t know how much longer I can scream at the top of my lungs every night, for an entire year on tour. Sometimes I wish I had taken the Bob Dylan route and sang songs where my voice would not go out on me every night, so I could have a career if I wanted.\nDF: So what does this mean for the future of Nirvana?\nKC: It’s impossible for me to look into the future and say I’m going to be able to play Nirvana songs in 10 years. There’s no way. I don’t want to have to resort to doing the Eric Clapton thing. Not to put him down whatsoever; I have immense respect for him. But I don’t want to have to change the songs to fit my age .\nDF: The song on In Utero that has whipped up the most controversy is Rape Me. It’s got a brilliant hook, but there have been objections to the title and lyric — not just from skittish DJs but from some women who feel its rather cavalier for a man to be using such a potent, inflammatory word so freely.\nKC: I understand that point of view, and I’ve heard it a lot. I’ve gone back and forth between regretting it and trying to defend myself. Basically, I was trying to write a song that supported women and dealt with the issue of rape. Over the last few years, people have had such a hard time understanding what our message is, what we’re trying to convey, that I just decided to be as bold as possible. How hard should I stamp this point? How big should I make the letters? It’s not a pretty image. But a woman who is being raped, who is infuriated with the situation ... it’s like Go ahead, rape me, just go for it, because you’re gonna get it. i’m a firm believer in karma, and that motherfucker is going to get what he deserves, eventually. That man will be caught, he’ll go to jail, and he’ll be raped. So rape me, do it, get it over with. Because you’re gonna get it worse.\nDF: What did your wife, Courtney, think of the song when she heard it?\nKC: I think she understood. I probably explained it better to her than I’ve explained it to you. I also want to make a point, that I was really, honestly not trying to be controversial with it. That was the last thing I wanted to do. We didn’t want to put it out so it would piss off the parents and get some feminists on our asses, stuff like that. I just have so much contempt for someone who would do something like that . This is my way of saying Do it once, and you may get away with it. Do it a hundred times. But you’re gonna get it in the end.\nDF: When you were arrested on the domestic-violence charge his summer, Courtney admitted to the police that you kept guns in your home. Why do you feel you need to be armed?\nKC: I like guns. I just enjoy shooting them.\nDF: Where? At what?\nKC: When we go out to the woods, at a shooting range. It’s not an official shooting range, but it’s allowed to be one in this county. There’s a really big cliff, so there’s no chance of shooting over the cliff and hurting anyone. And there’s no one within miles around.\nDF: Without getting too PC about it, don’t you feel it’s dangerous to keep them in the house, especially with your daughter, Frances, around?\nKC: No. It’s protection. I don’t have bodyguards. There are people way less famous than I am or Courtney who have been stalked and murdered. It could be someone by chance looking for a house to break into. We have a security system. I actually have one gun that is loaded, but I keep it safe, in a cabinet high up on a shelf where Frances can never get to it. And I have an M16, which is fun to shoot. It’s the only sport I have ever liked. It’s not something I’m obsessed with or even condone. I don’t really think much of it.\nDF: How does Courtney feel about keeping guns at home?\nKC: She was there when I bought them. Look, I’m not a very physical person. I wouldn’t be able to stop an intruder who had a gun or a knife. But I’m not going to stand by and watch my family stabbed to death or raped in front of me. I wouldn’t think twice of blowing someone’s head off if they did that. It’s for protection reasons. And sometimes it’s fun to go out and shoot. At targets. I want to make that clear .\nDF: People usually assume that someone who has sold a few million records is really livin ‘large. How rich are you? How rich do you feel? According to one story, you wanted to buy a new house and put a home studio in it, but your accountant said you couldn’t afford it.\nKC: Yeah, I can’t. I just got a check a while ago for some royalties for Nevermind, which is pretty good size. It’s weird, though, really weird. When we were selling a lot of records during Nevermind, I thought, God, I’m gonna have like $10 million, $15 million. That’s not the case. We do not live large. I still eat Kraft macaroni and cheese — because I like it, I’m used to it. We’re not extravagant people. I don’t blame any kid for thinking that a person who sells 10 million records is a millionaire and set for the rest of his life. But it’s not the case. I spent a million dollars last year, and I have no idea how I did it. Really. I bought a house for $400,000. Taxes were another $300,000-something. What else? I lent my mom some money. I bought a car. That was about it.\nDF: You don’t have much to show for that million.\nKC: It’s surprising. One of the biggest reasons we didn’t go on tour when Nevermind was really big in the States was because I thought: Fuck this, why should I go on tour? I have this chronic stomach pain, I may die on this tour, I’m selling a lot of records, I can live the rest of my life off a million dollars. But there’s no point in even trying to explain that to a 15-year-old kid. I never would have believed it.\nDF: Do you worry about the impact that your work, lifestyle and ongoing war with supercelebrity are having on Frances? She seemed perfectly content to toddle around in the dressing room tonight, but its got to be a strange world for her.\nKC: I’m pretty concerned about it. She seems to be attracted to almost anyone. She loves anyone. And it saddens me to know that she’s moved around so much. We do have two nannies, one full-time and another older woman who takes care of her on weekends. But when we take her on the road, she’s around people all the time, and she doesn’t get to go to the park very often. We try as hard as we can, we take her to preschool things. But this is a totally different world.\nDF: In Serve the Servants, you sing, I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad Are you concerned about making the same mistakes as a father that might have been made when you were growing up?\nKC: No. I’m not worried about that at all. My father and I are completely different people. I know that I’m capable of showing a lot more affection than my dad was. Even if Courtney and I were to get divorced, I would never allow us to be in a situation where there are bad vibes between us in front of her. That kind of stuff can screw up a kid, but the reason those things happen is because the parents are not very bright. I don’t think Courtney and I are that fucked up. We have lacked love all our lives, and we need it so much that if there’s any goal that we have, it’s to give Frances as much love as we can, as much support as we can. That’s the one thing that I know is not going to turn out bad.\nDF: What has been the state of relations within Nirvana over the past year?\nKC: When I was doing drugs, it was pretty bad. There was no communication. Krist and Dave, they didn’t understand the drug problem. They’d never been around drugs. They thought of heroin in the same way that I thought of heroin before I started doing it. It was just really sad. We didn’t speak very often. They were thinking the worst, like most people would, and I don’t blame them for that. But nothing is ever as bad as it seems. Since I’ve been clean, it’s gone back to pretty much normal. Except for Dave. I’m still kind of concerned about him, because he still feels like he can be replaced at any time. He still feels like he...\nDF: Hasn’t passed the audition?\nKC: Yeah. I don’t understand it. I try to give him as many compliments as I can. I’m not a person who gives compliments very often, especially at practice. Let’s do this song, let’s do that song, let’s do it over. That’s it. I guess Dave is a person who needs reassurance sometimes. I notice that, so I try and do that more often.\nDF: So you call all the shots?\nKC: Yeah. I ask their opinions about things. But ultimately, it’s my decision. I always feel weird saying that; it feels egotistical But we’ve never argued. Dave, Krist and I have never screamed at each other. Ever. It’s not like they’re afraid to bring up anything. I always ask their opinion, and we talk about it. And eventually, we all come to the same conclusions.\nDF: Haven’t there been any issues where there was at least heated discussion?\nKC: Yeah, the songwriting royalties. I get all the lyrics. The music, I get 75 percent, and they get the rest. I think that’s fair. But at the time, I was on drugs when that came up. And so they thought that I might start asking for more things. They were afraid that I was going to go our of my mind and start putting them on salary, stuff like that. But even then we didn’t yell at each other. And we split everything else evenly.\nDF: With all of your reservations about playing Smells Like Teen Spirit and writing the same kind of song over and over, do you envision a time when there is no Nirvana? That you’ll try to make it alone?\nKC: I don’t think I could ever do a solo thing, the Kurt Cobain Project.\nDF: Doesn’t have a very good ring to it, either.\nKC: No . But yes, I would like to work with people who are totally, completely the opposite of what I’m doing now. Something way out there, man.\nDF: That doesn’t bode well for the future of Nirvana and the kind of music you make together.\nKC: That’s what I’ve been kind of hinting at in this whole interview. That we’re almost exhausted. We’ve gone to the point where things are becoming repetitious. There’s not something you can move up toward, there’s not something you can look forward to. The best times that we ever had were right when Nevermind was coming out and we went on that American tour where we were playing clubs. They were totally sold out, and the record was breaking big, and there was this massive feeling in the air, this vibe of energy. Something really special was happening. I hate to actually even say it, but I can’t see this band lasting more than a couple more albums, unless we really work hard on experimenting. I mean, let’s face it. When the same people are together doing the same job, they’re limited. I’m really interested in studying different things, and I know Krist and Dave are as well. But I don’t know if we are capable of doing it together. I don’t want to put our another record that sounds like the last three records. I know we’re gonna put our one more record, at least, and I have a pretty good idea what it’s going to sound like: pretty ethereal, acoustic, like R.E.M.s last album. If I could write just a couple of songs as good as what they’ve written … I don’t know how that band does what they do. God, they’re the greatest. They’ve dealt with their success like saints, and they keep delivering great music. That’s what I’d really like to see this band do. Because we are stuck in such a rut. We have been labeled. R.E.M. is what? College rock? That doesn’t really stick. Grunge is as potent a term as New Wave. You can’t get out of it. It’s going to be passé. You have to take a chance and hope that either a totally different audience accepts you or the same audience grows with you.\nDF: And what if the kids just say, We don’t dig it, get lost?\nKC: Oh, well.

You know I felt so different and so crazy that people just left me alone. I always felt that they would vote me Most likely to kill everyone at a high school dance. You know?\nKurt Cobain: My mother has always tried to keep a little bit of English culture in our family. Like wed drink tea all the time. You know. Although Ive never really known my ancestry. I didnt even know, until this year, that the name Cobain was Irish. I found out through different phone books throughout America, I couldnt find any Cobains at all. So I started calling Coburns, and I found this one lady in San Francisco, and she had been researching our family history. And it came from County Cork, which is a weird coincidence, because when we toured, we played in Cork. And the entire day I walked around in a daze. Id never felt more spiritual in my life. I was almost in tears the whole day. It was the weirdest thing.\nKurt Cobain: I had a really good childhood until the divorce. Then all of a sudden my whole world changed. I couldnt face some of my friends at school. I desperately wanted to have the classic, typical family: mother, father.\nKurt Cobain: Because I couldnt find any friends, male friends that I felt compatible with, I ended up hanging out with the girls a lot. And I just always felt that they werent treated with respect, especially because women are just totally oppressed. I mean the words bitch and cunt were totally common. Although I listened to Aerosmith and Led Zeppelin, and I really did enjoy some of the melodies theyd written, it took me so many years to realize that a lot of it had to do with sexism. The way that they just wrote about their dicks and having sex. I was just starting to understand what really was pissing me off so much, those last couple of years of high school. And then punk rock was exposed and then it all came together. It just fit together like a puzzle.\nKurt Cobain: it expressed the way I felt socially and politically, and-- just everything. You know. It was the anger that I felt. The alienation.\nJon Savage: Did you have problems with people thinking that you were gay?\nKurt Cobain: Yeah. I even thought that I was gay. I thought that might be the solution to my problem. Although I never experimented with it, I had a gay friend, and then my mother wouldnt allow me to be friends with him anymore because, well, shes homophobic. It was real devastating, because finally Id found a male friend who I actually hugged and was affectionate to and we talked about a lot of things.\nJon Savage: So did you stop?\nKurt Cobain: Yeah, I couldnt hang out with him anymore.\nJon Savage: How do you sing?\nKurt Cobain: Most of the time, I sing right from my stomach. Right from where my stomach pain is. Doctors... Every time Ive had an endoscope, they find a red irritation in my stomach. But its all from anger. And screaming. I mean not only is my stomach-- has an inflamed irritation, but I have scoliosis. And the weight of the guitar has made my back grow in this curvature. So it gives me a back pain all the time, you know. Im always in pain, too, and that really adds to the anger in our music. It really does. Im kind of grateful for it in a way.\nJon Savage: Maybe youre feeling a bit better now...\nKurt Cobain: Yeah. Especially since Ive been married and Ive had a child. You know, within the last year, my whole mental state and my physical state has almost improved 100 percent. I havent felt this optimistic since... right before the divorce, you know?", "Johnny was a homo\nKept his body clean\nMoved to San Francisco\nCaught a big disease\nRaped by his Daddy\nTold he was at fault\nLiving life unhappy\nCovered up in salt\nWe’re living in a time of change\nToo many things you feel afraid to\nThink against the will of God\nMaybe someday soon they’ll realize they’re wrong\nLucy was a lesbian\nNo, no fun in the sack\nMoved to Acapulco\nNothing goes in her hole\nThen she met Johnny\nThey dated, went to formal\nHe and she got naughty\nFound out that it’s normal\nWe’re living in a time of changing\nToo many things you feel afraid to\nDoing many things against the will of God\nMaybe someday soon they’ll realize they’re wrong\nMade not born", "Hello\nHello\nHello\nMimi\nHello\nDa, da, da, da, da, da, da, da\nBom bom Bom bom\nBom bom Bom bom\nBom bom Bom bom\nBom bom Bom bom\nBom bom Bom bom\nBom bom Bom bom\nBom bom Bom bom\nBom bom Bom bom\nLoad up on bring your friends\nIts fun to lose and to pretend\nShes over bored and self-assured Mimi\nOh, no Mimi\nI know a dirty word\nOh!\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/How low\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/How low\nWith the lights out\nMimimimi\nHere we are now\nEntertain us\nI feel stupid\nMimimimi\nHere we are now\nEntertain us\nMe me me mu\nAn albino\nA mosquito\nMe me me mo\nMe me moo\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/How low\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/How low\nBom bom bom bom\nAnd I forget just why I taste\n Oh yeah, I guess it makes me smile\nI found it hard, its hard to find\nOh well\nWhatever, nevermind\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/How low\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/How low\nWith the lights out\nMee mee mee mee\nHere we are now\nEntertain us\nI feel stupid\nMee mee mee mee\nHere we are now\nEntertain us\nMee mee mee mu\nAn albino\nA mosquito\nMee mee mee mumu\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/Hello\nBom bom, Mimi/How low\nYeah\nYeah\nYeah\nMee mee\nYeah/Mee", "", "Ahem\nUnderground Celebritism\nLike to hit you with my jism\nMeeting people going places\nLike to smash them in the faces", "Oh my love\nOh my love\nOh my love\nOh my love", "Just stepping off the sidewalk\nThe bullies are offending me\nThe fear I should have turned from\nThe spoken word is obsolete\nDon’t let the bastard tempt you\nMy hallow grasp is getting me\nI can no longer write this\nMy journal has lost its freedom wonder who you are\nYour body burns in me\nIt’s really like disease\nAnd it stops the rain\nToo weak to…..\nIt’s so pathetic\nNot impressed by the bonds being....\n....Worth four hundred dollars\nEnded up the same\nI’m giving you what you think\nI’d settle mine for some green\nI do not want the brain scan\nI’d rather play with Vaseline\nThan know you lied to me\nBut it burns in me\nA pretty sight to see\nAnd it stops the rain\nToo weak to fight\nAhhh....", "Hey, the love of two\nA desire, is whats for you\nIs it real, a lullaby?\nFace to face, with an unamed mouth\nHey!

Christmas Eve, an old\njunkie selling Christmas seals on North Park Street.\nThe Priest, they called him. Fight tuberculosis, folks.\nPeople hurried by, gray shadows on a distant wall.\nIt was getting late and no money to score.\nHe turned into a side street and the lake wind hit him like a knife.\nCab stop just ahead under a streetlight.\nBoy got out with a suitcase. Thin kid in prep school clothes,\nfamiliar face, the Priest told himself, watching from the doorway.\nReminds me of something a long time ago. The boy, there, with his overcoat\nunbuttoned, reaching into his pants pocket for the cab fare.\nThe cab drove away and turned the corner. The boy went inside\na building. Hmm, yes, maybe - the suitcase was there in the doorway.\nThe boy nowhere in sight. Gone to get the keys, most likely,\nhave to move fast. He picked up the suitcase and started for the corner.\nMade it. Glanced down at the case. It didnt look like the case the boy had,\nor any boy would have. The Priest couldnt put his finger on what was so\nold about the case. Old and dirty, poor quality leather, and heavy.\nBetter see whats inside. He turned into Lincoln Park, found an\nempty place and opened the case. Two severed human legs that belonged to\na young man with dark skin. Shiny black leg hairs glittered in the\ndim streetlight. The legs had been forced into the case and he had to use\nhis knee on the back of the case to shove them out. Legs, yet,\nhe said, and walked quickly away with the case.\nMight bring a few dollars to score. The buyer sniffed suspiciously.\nKind of a funny smell about it. Its just Mexican leather.\nWell, some joker didnt cure it.\nThe buyer looked at the case with cold disfavor.\nNot even right sure he killed it, whatever it is.\nThree is the best I can do and it hurts. But since this is Christmas\nand youre the Priest... he slipped three bills under the table into the\nPriests dirty hand. The Priest faded into the street shadows, seedy\nand furtive. Three cents didnt buy a bag, nothing less than a nickel.\nSay, remember that old Addie croaker told me not to come back unless\nI paid him the three cents I owe him. Yeah, isnt that a fruit for ya,\nblow your stack about three lousy cents.\nThe doctor was not pleased to see him.\nNow, what do you WANT? I TOLD you!\nThe Priest laid three bills on the table. The doctor put the\nmoney in his pocket and started to scream.\nIve had TROUBLES! PEOPLE have been around!\nI may lose my LICENSE! The Priest just sat there, eyes, old and heavy with\nyears of junk, on the doctors face.\nI cant write you a prescription. The doctor jerked open a drawer\nand slid an ampule across the table. Thats all I have in the OFFICE!\nThe doctor stood up. Take it and GET OUT! he screamed, hysterical.\nThe Priests expression did not change.\nThe doctor added in quieter tones, After all, Im a professional man,\nand I shouldnt be bothered by people like you.\nIs that all you have for me? One lousy quarter G? Couldnt you lend\nme a nickel...? Get out, get out, Ill call the police I tell you.\nAll right, doctor, Im going. Of course it was cold and far to walk,\nrooming house, a shabby street, room on the top floor.\nThese stairs, coughed the Priest there, pulling himself up along the\nbannister. He went into the bathroom, yellow wall panels,\ntoilet dripping, and got his works from under the washbasin.\nWrapped in brown paper, back to his room, get every drop in the dropper.\nHe rolled up his sleeve. Then he heard a groan from next door,\nroom eighteen. The Mexican kid lived there, the Priest had passed him on\nthe stairs and saw the kid was hooked, but he never spoke, because he\ndidnt want any juvenile connections, bad news in any language.\nThe Priest had had enough bad news in his life.\nHe heard the groan again, a groan he could feel, no mistaking that groan\nand what it meant. Maybe he had an accident or something.\nIn any case, I cant enjoy my priestly medications with that sound coming\nthrough the wall. Thin walls you understand. The Priest put down his\ndropper, cold hall, and knocked on the door of room eighteen.\nQuien es? Its the Preist, kid, I live next door.\nHe could hear someone hobbling across the floor.\nA bolt slid. The boy stood there in his underwear shorts, eyes black with\npain. He started to fall. The Priest helped him over to the bed.\nWhats wrong, son? Its my legs, senor, cramps, and now I am without\nmedicine. The Priest could see the cramps, like knots of wood there\nin the young legs, dark shiny black leg hairs.\nA few years ago I damaged myself in a bicycle race,\nit was then that the cramps started. And now he has the leg cramps back\nwith compound junk interest. The old Priest stood there, feeling the boy\ngroan. He inclined his head as if in prayer, went back and got his dropper.\nIts just a quarter G, kid. I do not require much, senor.\nThe boy was sleeping when the Priest left room eighteen.\nHe went back to his room and sat down on the bed.\nThen it hit him like heavy silent snow. All the gray junk yesterdays.\nHe sat there received the immaculate fix. And since he was himself a priest,\nthere was no need to call one.", "She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak\nIve been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks\nIve been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap\nI wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black\nHey! Wait! I got a new complaint\nForever in debt to your priceless advice\nHey!

This note should be pretty easy to understand\nAll the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I havent felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guity beyond words about these things\nFor example when were back stage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowds begins., it doesnt affect me the way in which it did for Freddie Mercury, who seemed to love, relish in the the love and adoration from the crowd which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I cant fool you, any one of you. It simply isnt fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if Im having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage. Ive tried everything within my power to appreciate it . I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when theyre gone. Im too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasms I once had as a child\nOn our last 3 tours, Ive had a much better appreciation for all the people Ive known personally, and as fans of our music, but I still cant get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. Theres good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little, sensitive, unappreciative, Pisces, Jesus man. Why dont you just enjoy it? I dont know!\nI have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I used to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point to where I can barely function. I cant stand the thought of Frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that Ive become\nI have it good, very good, and Im grateful, but since the age of seven, Ive become hateful towards all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along that have empathy. Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess\nThank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. Im too much of an erratic, moody baby! I dont have the passion anymore, and so remember, its better to burn out than to fade away\nPeace, love, empathy\nKurt Cobain\nFrances and Courtney, Ill be at your altar\nPlease keep going Courtney,

before Kurt Cobain hit it big with his band, Nirvana, he was a struggling, starving musician. One of his many alleged stabs at fame was penning a song for the popular animated television series, Ren and Stimpy. Cobain has been said to have recorded the song on the cheap but felt proud of it. According to Ren and Stimpy voice actor Billy West, studio executives at Spumco Studios heard the song, thought it was awful, and then threw it out. Shortly after this, Nirvana became famous with their second album, Nevermind, making the Spumco and Nickelodeon еxecutives consider thеir decision to be a mistake.\nOnly Billy West has ever talked about this story, but nobody else at Spumco or Nickelodeon, nor anyone in the Cobain estate have confirmed nor denied this story, making it a mystery as to whether or not it actually happened. However, it has been proven in the Nirvana book, Come As You Are, that Cobain was indeed a Ren and Stimpy fan. The book includes a photo taken on New Years Day 1993 of Cobain with his plush Ren, with the caption reading, Kurt with close, personal friend, Ren Hoek.\nIf this story is true, and Kurt Cobain really did record a song for Ren and Stimpy, while some copies of it may still exist, the song has never been released as far as the general public knows. The alleged version Spumco had was trashed, so none of the executives at Spumco nor Nickelodeon would hold a copy. Still, Cobains estate is yet to comment on the matter at all. Many Ren and Stimpy fans who are also Nirvana fans are saddened by the fact that Cobain was rejected by Spumco, but remain hopeful that such an occurrence did happen, and that the song will someday be heard once more.\nIn 2015, the soundtrack to the documentary film about Cobains life, called Montage Of Heck, was released. It was entirely made up of home recordings hat Cobain made between 1986 and 1994. Many speculate that one of the songs on this album might be the song that Cobain submitted to Spumco for Ren and Stimpy. Some believe it to be the opening track, titled The Yodel Song. Others believe it to be Beans, Clean Up Before She Comes, or perhaps even one of the two Kurt Montage tracks. However, no one in the Cobain Estate, Spumco Studios, or Nickelodeon has commented on the matter. In 2020, the subject of Kurt Cobains Ren and Stimpy Theme song still remains a mystery.", "Watermark: \nThe he say she say need to fucking stop\nSayin she fucked this bitch and that bitch\nIts not my

Ova poruka trebala bi biti poprilično jednostavna za shvatiti.\nSva upozorenja s punk-rock 101 tečajeva tijekom godina, od mojeg prvog susreta, s recimo, moralima upletenim sa samostalnošću i prihvaćanjem svoje zajednice ispala su vrlo točna. Nisam osjetio uzbuđenje slušajući, pa isto tako i stvarajući, čitajući i pišući već previše godina. Riječi ne mogu opisati krivnju koju osjećam zbog toga.\nRecimo, kada smo u backstageu i kada se svjetla ugase i manični urlik publike započne; ne ostavlja na mene isti dojam koji je ostavljalo na Freddie Mercuryija koji je volio i sladio se u ljubavi i obožavanju koje mu je pružala publika što je nešto na čemu mu totalno zavidim i na čemu mu se divim. Stvar je u tome što vas ne mogu zavarati, nikog od vas. Nije fer ni prema meni ni prema vama. Najgori zločin koji mogu zamisliti je da varam ljude lažući i pretvarajući se kako se 100% zabavljam. Ponekad se osjećam kao da bi trebao imati sat u koji mogu udariti prije no što izađem na stage. Pokušao sam sve u svojoj moći kako bih bio zahvalan . Zahvalan sam na činjenici da smo zabavili i utjecali na toliko ljudi. Mora da sam jedan od onih narcisa koji je zahvalan na stvarima tek kada ih izgubi. Previše sam osjetljiv. Trebam biti malo tup kako bih povratio entuzijazam koji sam imao nekad kao djete.\nNa zadnje 3 turneje imao sam puno više zahvalnosti prema ljudima koje poznajem osobno i prema našim fanovima, ali idalje ne mogu prijeći preko frustracije, krivnje i empatije koju osjećam prema svima. Postoji dobro u svima nama i mislim da jednostavno previše volim ljude, toliko da me to još više i rastužuje. Tužna, mala, osjetljiva, nezahvalna Riba, ajme čovječe. Zašto jednostavno ne uživaš? Ne znam!\nImam boginju od žene iz koje kipi ambicija i empatija i kćer koja me previše podsjeća na ono što sam bio prije, puna ljubavi i sreće, ljubeći svaku osobu koju upozna zato što su svi dobri i nitko joj ne želi nauditi. Baš me to plaši do mjere gdje ne mogu funkcionirat. Ne mogu podnjeti misao o Frances kako postaje očajni, samouništavajući, death roker koji sam ja postao.\nProšao sam dobro, jako dobro i zahvalan sam, ali od sedme godine postao sam mrzak prema svim ljudima općenito. Samo zato što se čini da je jednostavno biti oko empatičnih ljudi. Samo zato što previše volim i žalim ljude, pretpostavljam.\nHvala svima iz dna moje goruće, mučne duše za sva pisma i svu brigu kroz godine. Prevelika sam neizvjesna, ćudljiva beba! Više nemam strasti, zato zapamtite, Bolje je izgorjeti, nago izblijediti.\nMir, ljubav, empatija.\nKurt Cobain\nFrances i Courtney, bit ću vaša izmjena.\nMolim te nastavi Courtney, za Frances.\nZa njezin život, koji će biti toliko sretniji bez mene.\nVOLIM VAS!
