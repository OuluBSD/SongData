bridge\nSay that our love aint water under the bridge\nIts so cold in your wilderness\nI want you to be my keeper\nBut not if you are so reckless\nIf youre gonna let me down, let me down gently\nDont pretend that you dont want me\nOur love aint water under the bridge\nIf youre gonna let me down, let me down gently\nDont pretend that you dont want me\nOur love aint water under the bridge\nSay it aint so, say it aint so\nSay it aint so, say it aint so\nSay that our love aint water under the bridge \nSay it aint so, say it aint so\nSay it aint so, say it aint so\nSay it aint so, say it aint so\nSay that our love aint water under the bridge \nSay it aint so, say it aint so\nSay that our love aint water under the bridge", ""]}
