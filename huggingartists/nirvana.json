Do a solo! Solo!\"", "A while ago, I found myself in bloody exhaust grease London again with an all-consuming urge to hunt for two rare things: back issues of NME rumored to be secretly hidden in glass casings and submerged in the fry vats of every kebab machine in the U.K.and the very-out-of-print first Raincoats LP\nThe NME search was a clever, saucy upstart of an attempt to be, uh, nasty. However, the Lord and Julian Cope himself know how we need, need, need, the NME to embrace the unifying hands of our children across this big blue marble and NIRVANAs tarty musical career. So please bless us again -- well forever feed off of your high-calorie boggy turbinates\nIn an attempt to satisfy the second part of my quest, I went to the Rough Trade shop and, of course, found no Raincoats record in the bin. I then asked the woman behind the counter about it and she said \"well, it happens that Im neighbors with Anna and she works at an antique shop just a few miles from here.\" So she drew me a map and I started on my way to Annas\nSometime later, I arrived at this elfin shop filled with something else Ive compulsively searched for over the past few years -- really old fucked up marionette-like wood carved dolls . Lots of them... Ive fantasized about finding a shop filled with so many. They wouldnt accept my credit card but the dolls were really way too expensive anyway. Anna was there, however, so I politely introduced myself with a fever-red face and explained the reason for my intrusion. I can remember her mean boss almost setting me on fire with his glares. She said \"well, I may have a few lying around so, if I find one, Ill send it to you .\" I left feeling like a dork, like I had violated her space, like she probably thought my band was tacky\nA few weeks later I received a vinyl copy of that wonderfully classic scripture with a personalized dust sleeve covered with xeroxed lyrics, pictures, and all the members signatures. There was also a touching letter from Anna. It made me happier than playing in front of thousands of people each night, rock-god idolization from fans, music industry plankton kissing my ass, and the million dollars I made last year. It was one of the few really important things that Ive been blessed with since becoming an untouchable boy genius\nIt was as rewarding as touring with Shonen Knife and watching people practically cry with joy at their honesty. It made people happy and it made me happy knowing that I had helped bring them to the UK\nIt was as rewarding as the last Vaselines show in Edinburgh. They reformed just to play with us in their home town, probably having no idea how exciting and flattering it was for us \nIt was as rewarding as being asked to support Sonic Youth on two tours, totally being taken under their wing and being showed what dignity really means\nIt was as rewarding as the drawings Daniel Johnston sent me, or the Stinky Puffs single from Jad Fairs son, or playing on the same bill as Greg Sage in L.A., or being asked to help produce the next Melvins record, or being on the Wipers compilation, or Thor from T.K. giving me a signed first edition of Naked Lunch, or making a friend like Stephen Pavlovic -- our Australian tour promoter who sent me a Mazzy Star LP on vinyl, or playing \"The Money Will Roll Right In\" with Mudhoney, or having the power to insist on bringing Bjorn Again to the Reading Festival, or being able to afford to bring my friend Ian along on tour just to have a good time, or paying Calamity Jane five-thousand dollars to be heckled by twenty thousand macho boys in Argentina, or asking my friends Fits Of Depression to play with us at The Seattle Coliseum, or playing with Poison Idea at a No On Nine benefit in Portland organzied by Gus Van Zandt, or being a part of oen of L7s pro-choice benefits in L.A., or kissing Chris and Dave on Saturday Night Live just to spite the homophobes, or meeting Iggy Pop, or playing with The Breeders, Urge Overkill, the T.V. Personalities, The Jesus Lizard, Hole, Dinosour Jr., etc\nWhile all these things were very special, none were half as rewarding as having a baby with a person who is the supreme example of dignity, ethics and honesty. My wife challenges injustice and the reason her character has been so severely attacked is because she chooses not to function the way the white corporate man insists. His rules for women involve her being submissive, quiet, and non-challenging. When she doesnt follow his rules, the threatened man gets scared\nA big \"fuck you\" to those of you who have the audacity to claim that Im so naive and stupid that I would allow myself to be taken advantage of and manipulated\nI dont feel the least bit guilty for commericially exloiting a completely exhausted Rock youth Culture because, at this point in rock history, Punk Rock is, to me, dead and gone. We just wanted to pay tribute to something that helped us to feel as though we had crawled out of the dung heap of conformity. To pay tribute like an Elvis or Jimi Hendrix impersonator in the tradition of a bar band. Ill be the first to admit that were the 90s version of Cheap Trick or the Knack but the last to admit that it hasnt been rewarding\nAt this point I have a request for our fans. If any of you in any way hate homosexuals, people of different color, or women, please do this one favor for us -- leave us the fuck alone! Dont come to our shows and dont buy our records\nLast year, a girl was raped by two wastes of sperm and eggs while they sang the lyrics to our song \"Polly\".

We played around for two years before the release of Bleach in June, 1989. At the time, Live shows were our bread and butter . Wed hit the road for months at a time... coming back with one or two grand... to be split three ways. In those days, that was as much \"success\" as we thought possible\nThe earliest performances on this album are brought to you courtesy of a sound board cassette recording of a December, 1989 show at Londons Astoria. \"Breed\" and \"Polly\" are taken from this show, the last date of a European tour supporting fellow Sub-Poppers, Tad\nEarly in 1991, the band signed with Geffen Records and acquired professional management. D.I.Y. fefll to the wayside\nNevermind was recorded in the spring of 1991. Following summer tours with Dinosaur Jr. and The Jesus Lizard, Nevermind was released in the fall. Immediately following the release, we went on a tour headlining small venues that culminated with a Halloween Homecoming Show at Seattles Paramount Theater. This show was filmed and recorded onto multi-track... yielding the version of Negative Creep, used in compliling this record\nTwo days later, the band left for another European tour. \"School,\" \"Been A Son,\" \"Lithium\" and \"Blew\" were all taken from a show at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, Netherlands, on November 25, 1991. The show was filmed and recorded on multi-track for Dutch TV. \"Spank Thru,\" this version having been recorded on November 19, 1991 in Rome, was actually the first Nirvana song\nWhile we were touring Europe, Nevermind was becoming all the rage back home. Though we were kept informed of the momentum, being so far away made us pretty oblivious to the extent of what was happening\nWe ended the year with a brief West Coast Tour. The bill included Pearl Jam and Nirvana and was headlined by The Red Hot Chili Peppers. The second show of this tour was on December 28, 1991 at the Del Mar Fairgrounds . For whatever reason, our set was particularly aggressive that night - \"Drain You,\" \"Aneurysm\" and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" were all taken from this recording\nEarly in 1992, the band toured Australia and Japan. Later in the summer, we traveled to Europe to make up some Scandinavian shows we had to cancel on the previous tour. The touring highlight of the year, however, was a headlining slot on Englands Reading Festival. I have to say that hearing tens of thousands of people sing along with \"Lithium\" was a very cool moment in the history of the band. We were having fun playing and deciding to stretch the set out a bit - enter \"Tourettes,\" a song which had been around for a few years \nFollowing the release of In Utero in 1993, we once again hit the road. Using left over props from the \"Heart-Shaped Box\" video shoot as set dressing , we concentrated on working up a set that spanned the bands entire career and gave the audience a longer show than we had done on past tours. In that we were playing the \"big\" halls on this tour, it felt like we needed to bring along a \"big\" sound... ladies and gentleman, please welcome Pat Smear\n\"Scentless Apprentice\" was filmed and recorded by MTV for their 1993 New Years special... recorded at a show at a pier in Seattle. \"Heart-Shaped Box\" comes from a sound board DAT recording from a show at The Forum in Los Angeles in December, 1993. We took \"Milk It\" from a sound board recording from the Seattle Center Arena. \"Sliver\" is taken from a board tape from the Springfiled Civic Center \nIn presenting this record, we hope that the ultimate allure of Nirvana as well as the passion that we had - and have - for the music we made is once again brought to the forefront. Let all the analysis fall away like yellow, aged newsprint. Crank this record up and realize the bliss, power and passion...\nTOTAL NIRVANA!\nKrist Novoselic", "Baby youre going Down In The Dark\nShow my lonely night is fallen and I dont have very long\nThink might of broke my boil\nWithin my face might burn\nYoure gonna make it better for a little while\nBaby youre gonna die someday\nSee you in your crowded wasted , then you start to fade\nThat when we start singing faster\nI wouldnt wait so long\nWont get any easier in the Dark\nOh, yeah, yeah, yeahh\nYou Will, You Will, You Will....", "And as the soft pretentious mountains\nGisten in the light of the trees\nAnd the flowers sing in D minor\nAnd the birds fly happily\nWell be together once again my love\nI need you back, oh baby baby\nI cant explain just why we lost it from the start\nLiving without you girl, you only break my heart\nI can feel it, I can hold it\nI can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it\nHe can cut it, She can taste it\nSpank it, I can ejaculate it\nIve been looking for day glow\nAlways hearing the same old\nSticky boredom with a book\nI can make it do things you wouldnt think it ever could\nI can feel it, I can hold it\nI can bend it, I can shape it, I can mold it\nHe can cut it, He can taste it\nSpank it, I can ejaculate it\nIve been looking for day glow\nAlways hearing the same old\nSticky boredom with a book\nI can make it do things you wouldnt think it ever would\nIve been looking for day glow\nAlways hearing the same old\nSticky boredom with a book\nI can make it do things you wouldnt think it ever could", "Oh lesser God\nOh loathe me\nOh lesser God\nOh loathe me\nOh lesser God\nOh loathe me\nYou get, you get, you get\nYou get to me\nHoly is the time, its such an easy way to go\nYou get, you get, you get\nYou get to be\nHide the struggle in the skin under a fingernail\nOh lesser God\nOh you’re lonely\nOh lesser God\nOh youre lonely\nOh lesser God\nOh youre lonely\nWaste your time by saving worthless gullibles\nKill a politician and then wear his clothes\nThis decade is the age of rehashing\nProtest and then go to jail for trespassing\nDriving me insane\n-Sane\nGo\nHome", "Im not gonna make you croon\nSomething else is something new\nIm not gonna make you dream\nSuicide is something mean\nIm not gonna make you gruel\nIts something else, its something new\nIm not gonna make you through\nIts something else, its something new\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nIm not gonna make you croon\nSomething sad, something blue\nIm not gonna make you scream\nIn this hour, its something mean\nIm not gonna make it through\nSomething else, its something new\nIm not gonna make you dream\nIn this hour, its something mean\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nHold it in your gut\nGut, gut, gut\nGut, gut, gut, gut\nGut, gut, gut, gut\nGut, gut, gut, gut", "When I looked you in the eye\nI knew it was time for good-bye\nYou were the only one I had around\nBut you couldnt keep your feet on the ground\nRun rabbit run\nBut whats that youre runnin for\nRun rabbit run\nYou aint gonna run no more\nBye bye baby, bye bye bird!\nThought the cold sidewalk stones\nBroke your little brittle bones\nI know you were already dead\nWhen the truck rolled over your head\nBye bye baby, bye bye bird!", "You\nWaiting for a plane to rise\nNever let you smother me\nAnd Ive got this dream where I have a girl like you\nI go out of my way to make you a deal\nIll wet my bed, wear high heels\nIll go out of my way to prove I still\nSmell him on you\nShes\nWaiting for a family ride\nMarijuana on the coat \nAnd Ive got this dream where I have a girl like you\nI go out of my way to make you a deal\nIll wet my bed, wear high heels\nIll go out of my way to prove I still\nSmell him on you\nTruth\nCovered in security\nI wont let you smother me\nAnd Ive got this dream where I have a girl like you\nI go out of my way to make you a deal\nIll wet my bed, wear high heels\nI go out of my way to make you a deal\nIll wet my bed and Ill wear high heels\nIll go out of my way to prove I still\nSmell him on you\nI still\nSmell him on you\nSmell him on you", "Kurt Cobain: I-I cant say that Ive heard a band who sounds like they rip us off, or-or have been influenced by us.

Nirvana used to be described as the hopeful band from Seattle before they produced the first record. However, Nirvana is now one of the most popular bands in the US. The music they play doesnt stick to any formalities and leads heavy metal in the new generation, therefore it is called Alternative Heavy Rock. I will neither write more details about Alternative Heavy Rock, nor investigate their music from professional eyes. Anyway, all I can say is that the music of Nirvana influences a lot of teenagers today\nNirvanas commercial success is the biggest mystery in the music scene. I dont want you to misunderstand. I didnt say Nirvana did not have enough ability to get Platinum Disk prize, but nobody could expect they would be such a famous band. The reason people think Nirvanas success is a mystery is that Geffen , sold only a few Nevermind at first but a lot of young people bought it and Nirvana got big money even then. But I think Nirvana themselves are very surprised about this incident. Actually, I had a chance to interview Kurt Cobain during English concert tours . He said the following:\n\"I didnt expect we would be so famous. I didnt even expect that our CD would be in the top 100 ranking in Billboard. You see, we had been in Europe before the great fuss. I dont want to relate with this fuss because I hate that a lot of fans are waiting for us at the airport.\"\nKurt Cobain seemed like he was saying \"Dont lose your mind\" to himself during the interview. Maybe they know a lot of musicians who lost their thoughts and became the toy of mass media. So Kurt Cobain is protecting himself before he goes the same way. Nirvana will come to Japan pretty soon so that you will be able to understand what I am trying to say. Because they will come to Japan, I will advise you about their concert. First thing I have to tell is that the concert is always unsociable. And also they are easily influenced by the environment so it depends on your luck whether the concert is very nice or boring\nThis CD is released just for Japan . Id like to introduce each song on this mini-album, but we dont even know what songs will be on the CD. By one Japanese record companys information, two of the songs from the Smells Like Teen Spirit CD single, which are Even In His Youth and Aneurysm. It may also include some songs which were broadcast by BBC Radio-1 in England. It may be just a rumor, but one of them may be their favorite song by the Vaselines\nI think that most of the people who bought this mini-CD have Nevermind too. But if it is the first time to buy Nirvanas CD for you, I recommend you to experience Nevermind.

Here at NIRVANA Central, the switch boards are buzzing, the conveyor belts are moving fast, and the crews are working double shifts towards the Septemeber 24th release date. The band, being the benevolent friends of the proleteriet that they are, just raised the coolies pay 10¢ to an even $1.50 an hour. The same price as the ALL AMERICAN MEAL at McDONALDS™.\nNIRVANA, in special conjunction with McDonalds™, are proud to announce the NEVERMIND HAPPY MEAL™. The only way to receive NEVERMIND is when you buy the HAPPY MEAL™. It will not be available in stores, just like another project NIRVANA has been working on, NIRVANA PLAY CHARIOTS OF FIRE AND OTHER HITS. It will only be available through a special T.V. offer. And, as an added bonus, a book called NIRVANAS CRAFT SECRETS will be offered. It will show you all of our special touches for those sea shell macrame plant hangers and spray painted macaroni paperweights and much much more.\nWe are also doing a tour of shopping malls and county fairgrounds to promote out new record and book of craft secrets.\nAlso in the planning is a video cassette demonstrating how to have a tranquil day at the beach collecting driftwood and sea shells, and how to make the memory last by constructing a wall hanging with what you have found. Well have tranquil New Age music, along with step by step instructions so you can relax while you work. Rainbow and unicorn stickers will also be included. Look for it in 92.\nWell thats all for now folks. See you soon.\nYours truely,\nKurdt, Chris, Dave", "Im so happy - cause today I found my friends\nTheyre in my head\nIm so ugly - thats okay cause so are you\nWe broke our mirrors\nSunday mornin - is
