that .44 easier\nI got a pack looking like multiple bags of Maltesers\nI went and got nicked upsuh, two ninas\nNow I got Intent to Supply on my previous\nI can’t have beef with these eedyats\nBack

believing\nBeef in the streets, I don’t reason\nBeef in the streets, get seasoned\nNiggas cant be my G and turn their back on OFB cause that one theres treason\nI was prison, on the wing fisting\nRight now Im home and I’m still drilling\nAll for my Gs them, Im my brothers keeper\nFeds said I can’t be with Headz cause they know that’s Freddy and Jason\nYou got a hundred man in your vids but when I slide through your block its vacant\nThem niggas soft it’s blatant\nThey dont want smoke, theyre vaping\nI got a .44 long, that’s new, and a old dot, that’s ancient\nRV, man, I’m way too pokey\nAnd I back guns and get smokey\nHeadz got the hammer like Thor\nThats bro, I guess I gotta be Loki\nMy team be shooting and scoring long time, should ha got a trophy\nLook, this beef tings deeper than rap\nCant let them do me like–\nBack out my ting won’t pet it\nAim for your chest then wet it\nCant tell me bout beef or Ps cause I mash work and I get it\nMan claim they got beef with the gang but see me on the roads and leg it\nWhen I caught man lacking in jail; no verbal, just set it\nRV Im a problem, and the other side know this\nIf I can’t line up a driver had to get round there and ten toes it\nGot a big stick like Moses\nFed gon tape up the whole strip\nFind out where youre posted\nBrain stuck on the wall like a Post-It\nFrom way back me and Rev captained T like Hoddle\nDip down a pussy on the opp block, turned that whole block brothel\nThe last time I put in a work in a weekday, Sunday I listened to some gospel\nThen on Monday I scored full throttle, that’s me in a bruck down Vauxhall\nMy class is A, still four an a half of the B in the bando\nFeds had me locked in the C, cant trust my bird get handled\nI got this bad B coming to the nizz for the D no need for a Tinsel or a Nandos\nBitches in the hood moving fruity but theres no need for a kiwi or mango\nSummertime my Gs keep the strip hot, no need for a Bigga or Snapple\nMe and front ride with the swam in the whip, no need for a flicky or rambo\nHow you gonna spend your own money on your grills but you don’t know how to fry like Nandos?\nHear big guns get handled\nPaigons see me ten toes like a

sentence\nNever had time for repentance\nBeen a bad boy from day\nI was doing lines in detention\nNo face, no case, no comment, fed cant ask me no questions\nI dont do this for attention\nNiggas get got in a sevens\nI got shells for the dots\nAnd I just put in two like western\nSo when you start adding those Ks make sure I dont get a mention\nSay what you want about RV, but no ones made me a victim\nChef man down with the Ramsey, I dont take knife from the kitchen\nI treat opps like AC cause I’m tryna drop that instant\nI treat opps like AC cause I’m tryna drop that instant\nI used to get round there with blades in my hand like a wolverine\nPull up, crash, them man dash, how can you call this beef?\nI don’t even call it beef\nI just got war with neeks\nNiggas keep talking grief\nPress

foreign\nOn time for my freshmans dinner\nAnd then I finish with a soft drink\nSlim and heads\nThat sounds like the trap and skengs\nAnd I came a long way from little old me\nJust coz back then we done it on peds\nNow I just pull up in foreign whips\nYou can miss me with the politics\nCoz I paid 60 racks for the watch and that\nNo way I borrowed this\nSo just keep it good\nAnd no way I could beef these kids\nThey dont keep it hood\nAnd I feel like the one with the twos that I done in the T\nJust repeating juggs\nIt was just me, mention slim, we talking Gs\nI know about work\nHow many times did I turn on the heat and fuck up a bird?\nExcellent stuff\nAnd the trap phone is peppering up\nIf it werent for the funds, glitz and glamour\nWould I be getting this love?\nIf it werent for

screaming money aint a thing thats a mindset\nI signed for peanuts to my label \nCause I come up from nothing, and now it just Gucci, cuff links\nThey said that the deal wont change you\nBut if you get stopped with fifty racks in cash then the jakes cant touch you\nI signed my deal on a Monday , Tuesday I blew some money \nWednesday I patterned up pops, Im feeling like Im blessed by God and mumsy \nShutdown my show on a Thursday, Friday I had a copped out from early \nUh, but the opps want clout more than they wanna hurt me\nIts still losses and winnings, but the fans wanna see these drillers\nThey dont want me living, they want me existin\nYou know how it gets in prison\nTwenty-four hours is a drive-by shootin, I call that social distance\nUh, and they wanna blame me for all the

link up with the oppers\nCount me out a relation spoilt \nI still say Hello to auntie \nMost at them old school hall parties\nOr sip sips of a Supermalt, but now if you link up we dish out smoke\nBut

metal on pedals, before we ever done it in rentals\nBack then it was kitchen utensils, real life we come a long way from pencils\nPut sweets in the skeng, but they kinda come more like Strepsils\nThe hustle goes right through my vessels\nI got the fiends moving like United, back in the 90s they coming for trebles\nI went and got myself indicted, I done a good finish and I made the net nestle\nI done it from kway like Hernán Crespo\nTT smelling like Dettol, still distribute balls like Deco\nI love my one level and a trackie, I couldnt care less about Kenzo\nHeavy Metal, tryna catch more than an AM with a Skengdo\nBut I still step with my shank, cah every little helps like Tesco\nHeavy metal\nGang gotta dish it all out, and thats when they will respect you\nWe go there apply all this pressure, they cannot be disrespectful\n, because they all know that its levels\nReal talk they know that its levels\nTimes that I cooked in that kettle and metal, I hit induction and settled those metals\nMy cutlery was a metal, thats why I love me some metal\nBad b come to the Niz for the D, moretime it aint nothing but leisure\nIt come like the D made of metal, and shorty digging for treasure\nI was in the jailhouse doing up Zanco, had no charger playing with cables\nThey aint even knew I was able, now Im getting phone calls about labels\nWe just cant compare these risks, live corn on my hip while Im live on the radio\n7 times out of 10 gang got it, if you want you can test that ratio\nI told my young one get this bread, but hell still smoke if I say so\nHow many new strips have I hit with 8 balls, Im still putting Dudley brothers on tables\nI was serving in the rain while I didnt have no raincoat\nI been married to Elizabeth and them man were unfaithful\nNow for my freedom Im grateful\nBut I still got opps, so if I go there and catch me one thats Finders Keepers like Kojo and Mabel\nMake sure the treys full, I leave something unstable\nShow man a real meaning of leanin, come like they just drank a whole crateful\nHeavy Metal\nGang gotta dish it all out, and thats when they will respect you\nWe go there apply all this pressure, they cannot be disrespectful\n,

burned that bridge\nMy friends kept phones and I had them pop on the wanted list\nHow we ever wonder ‘fore it works on them\nBut it used to be the ones we were wanted with\nI’mma fly \nThey tryna prove I’m not law abiding\nI’m just tryna pour and feed the family\nKobe Bryant\nThese niggas ain’t loyal they better off my cell\nBlood in the soil, it’s full of pythons\nWe can never let bygones be bygones\nToured them out in the summer\nFeelin’ like Roddy I ain’t tryna die young\nAnd the fast lane jumped in the Prada\nAnd it’s comin on nylon\nChucky and Dior runners\nCharge it to the come up\nI got lit now she wanna be loved but\nDo you love me for me?\nOr love me for the flick?\nThis shit confusin’ me\nI distract myself with the drip\nI’m blinded by jewelry\nI got enough Louis on me\nSo I

daggers\nOld school days, blood on my mums cooking knife, no hammers\nNow I bag up the light in cling, still rise up my rusty ting\nI had to switch up how I text, before the jakes come like whats

in \nBlue plastic bag full of munchies\nCouplе brown rizlas, scale and cling \nTurn room 106 to a bando\nHeading down at the dеsk when mans checking in \nAnd its approaching 12\nOne-legged Sam gets disability allowance \nNo deals after midnight\nCan make five bills by 1 if I link him and Howard \nHas your phone never rung all day\nGo in the bathroom and it rings in the shower \nTwo missed calls from a phone box\nAint had a sale in 22 hours\nMust have been bored if youve ever seen headsout\nMe I bring the Louis V store to the penthouse\nI was angry when shh got cheffed down\nLeft them in the corner shop by the food stretched out\nT house didnt do textiles\nI sent text out \nShe didnt wanna know way back when\nBut now she cooks me breakfast with her breast out \nSummer time with the football boots\nNo shin pads or socks, all the legs out \nNow feds at the scene, theyre asking questions\nLike whats all the mess bout? \nSeven pebs I gave to Fiona for the bando to get rent out \nI was posted in alley to the trenches\nNow I go uptown to bring the whole trench out\nI just need to get a parking permit\nCheeks my parcel, then Im in the town centre \nWhos that with the big issue magazine?\nLeaning like he just come off a bender \nMy favorite time of the year in the trap game is the last week in December \nCah everyone goes back for Christmas\nI just stay trapping till the new year enter\nThis deuce holds seven, this trey holds five\nAnd this 9 holds ten plus like 6 more \nI left my phone cranked, got bare missed calls\nNow my managers pissed, thought I was in court \nI cant speak on what happened last time\nIts a in-house ting, man might get upset \nI rent a room in this bando premises\nLandlord dont know the cats dem sublet \nYou ever have to hop that window bank in the garden, thats multitasking\nFeds at the door, Im on my second strike\nSo you know Im going straight to the can like sardines \nNew spot, Im tryna make it right\nIt can all go left in a heartbeat \nI still got my bottom joggers filled up with twenties\nAnd my rack filled up with charlie \nIts nothing but smoke that we got for them\nMust have run up a thirty in Scottish glens\nThats till he seen me in the Daily Mail and he went and called me by my government\nMy youngboy try go up for a week\nNow they got him in a monkey stretch \nTook the grub Aberdeen, so we could charge twelve for a Z\nAsk Fletch\nI aint waiting in town for the drop\nOr paying five bills to these new resellers \nBut if you got a size 9 in stock\nMan will cop and shop with these new plate tenners \nTwo-fifth for these Jordan 1s\nAnd a .44 long in this Gucci sweater \nBadman, she likes when I undress her\nAnd put my machine on her makeup dresser\nI gotta glove up when I touch that presser \nBro said he cant mix money and violence\nBecause that just make your name too pepper\nFlip me a likkles and brown, not brandy \nGet me a shotgun thats lanky \nYou know me, I just get too angry\nAnd fill the ding dong with the two-two gennas \nWhere Im from, its scary\nNiggas scary, they dont pull up\nThem dudes only slide round rarely\nAnd shoot at the sky, we gotta look up\nBitches like Do you follow back on the Gram?\nBitch, barely, Im stuck up\nSaying Ive changed cause I got a bit of money\nBitch, shut the fuck up \nIm a young black king that knows his worth\nI dont do hookups\nMe and bro in the

role?\nLuckily I wear these gloves, I could never leave my prints on those\nCant mix pleasure with business, Ive gotta leave this bitch on hold\nOne day I can twin these rambos, next day me and Tugg twin these poles\nLean out the ride tryna hold that steady, I aint gotta swing this pole\nPigs want the Gs on \nOne day Im fresh home, next day Im chinging and skeng those goals\nMe and RV on the opp block, thats Dwight Yorke and Andrew Cole\nI told RV just slap it in reverse, been tryna put man on a t-shirt\nTryna take mans blood home on this tonight cos finders keepers\nIll wrap both hands round a 4s and spin it like DJ Grevious\nRe-up on loads, lose weight and still aint gone down to a medium\nThey ask how I aint got more previous, must be a genius\nSkeng blow like balloons on helium, the whole gang far from lenient\nWent from auto spinners and leaners, to servery workers and cleaners\nThats gum from heaters, to using pipes as heaters\nLittle bro lost a boot, Cinderella\nLifestyle’s

Hazard like I play for Chelsea\nCame outta jail, got me a shank and a sim card\nScore points on the opps, then I just dab like I’m Lingard\nHad no beans on my canteen sheet, now I eat steak and lobster\nJust red up on budge, and bro did a yay like Drogba\nPut 6 in your back like Pogba\nReal life shit no soccer\nJump out do man proper\nStainless steel for the rambo, but you know that the shells are copper\nWave sticks like Harry Potter\nDrive through Wood Green with the Big Mac and I go BK for a whopper\nGot a Lyca sim in my Nokia, and I make sure the batterys full\nMy plug just gave me a brick, he already knows that its manageable\nI used to wipe dust off of scales, this time round Im bagging it all\nYou was selling sweets in the playground, and I had draws I was trapping in school\nRule number 1, fiends dont come to the crib\nTell em just wait where you are, or meet me under the bridge\nI do the trap ting properly, I shot white and I shot b\nMoving all of this weight, I had to tell my worker to spot me\nLittle bro lost a boot, Cinderella\nLifestyle’s like a movie, no Interstellar\nAnytime I get that drop, I be posted up like a selfie\nMe and Headz like Freddie and

lose \nThis lifestyle chose me, you know I didnt choose \nThe system just wanna see me in the news \nRacial profiling, they discriminate when they judge you\nIn the courthouse, see this long hair like
