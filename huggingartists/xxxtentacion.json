Here are a few examples\nEmmett Till, August 28th, 1955, Mississippi — pulled out of his house in the middle of the night, in front of his mother who had to watch her son be taken from her on the sidelines, for little to no reason at all worth murdering a fourteen-year-old boy. Castrated, mutilated, but also documented for the years to see\nKori Ali Muhammad, black-on-white. Philando Castile, white-on-black. Now these things never come to or remotely remain in the public eye. And the youth is never inspired to take a stand to make a difference. So I will speak for them. The youth, that is, the ones full of innocence. The ones inspired by the things around them, to matter\nI can go on forever about the fact that murder is murder whether youre black or white. You should always feel free to voice your opinion, but to act out on these irrational thoughts in every shape or form is disgusting. You cannot, as black or white, call yourself the supreme race when moved out of your comfort by the oppositions color, their skin color. That is no form of being or demonstrating being a supreme being\nIf you are a supremacist, be unmoved by the opposition. Remain unscathed in the comfort of your own home, in your own realm. Demonstrate care for the youths future, white or black, black or white. Are you willing to risk your childs future due to your own bigotry?

So, Ill offer this warning and set of instructions; if you are not open-minded before you listen to this album, open your mind. If you dont listen to the alternative sound and youve never been into the alternative sound and have not been open to trying different things; open your mind before you listen to this album. You can listen to it anywhere, preferably your room, your car, but it can be played anywhere. This album is far different, far more versatile, far more uplifting than the last.

Well call it a helping hand.\nDamn, I gotta get in my feelings I guess.\nFor those of you that I guess feel misguided or feel, what would the word be?\nA little bit not in tune with whats going on around you and you feel confused, you feel like youre just following whatever is right in front of you\nHeres what I call a helping hand, heres how Ill help you do it:\nWith whatever you apply your attention to is which direction your life will go in.\nSo say for instance you see money in your life and thats what you want more of.\nThe more you apply your attention towards money is the more it will appear.\nThe more you apply your attention towards bad things in your life, the more it will appear.\nThe more you apply your attention, such as the good things in your life, the more it will appear.\nPeople think that people such as DJ Khaled, or like people that are successful maybe people like Kanye.\nOr these bigger artist, they see them as crazy because of what they display and that they display it so simple, but its literally what it is.\nSo, the key to success would be more success. The more you apply your attention towards your success.\nThe more you apply your attention to the good things around you, the more you apply your attention to the things that you want in your life is the more it appears.\nAnd that, theres no other way to actually say that, so for those of you that feel like youve been thrown into some sort of disarray.\nWoah, did it pause? Oh, well no it didnt pause.\nYeah, for those of you that are kind of like lost in space in your mind, just understand that your attention is important.\nWhatever you, whatever you, how do I put it?\nWhat you want will appear if you surround yourself with it.\nSo if you want that brand new car, surround yourself with success, surround yourself with money so this car will eventually pop up.\nTheres no simpler way-holy shit.\nShouts out to Teflon Sean.\nYou need to make a, need to make a SoundCloud, Teflon.\nBut yeah, also, study the Golden Beetle.\nWith that being said, goodbye.", "Abso-lutely\nSo soft and so tragic, as a slaughterhouse\nYou press the knife against your heart\nAnd say that, I love you so much, you must kill me, now\nI love you- Beyond the pale \nEverythings black, no turning back \nBeyond the pale \nBeyond the pale \nRetribution falls for my love from the trees \nIn this house of glass, I cant break free, you cannot see, okay\nLove, it can be all I want, it can be all I need \nId much rather be alone , youd much rather watch me bleed", "Yeah, eenie meenie meenie miney mo\nEenie meenie meenie miney mo\nYeah, eenie meenie meenie miney mo \nEenie meenie meenie miney mo\nEenie meenie meenie miney mo \nEenie meenie meenie miney mo\nYeah\nYour bitch give head to shoulders knees and toes \nIm the realest nigga I suppose \nFloor it, thwart it, quart it, Stop to sort it\nBut we navigating to your mamas house \nBloods up in my duffel, bitch says Im a shovel\nCatch a opp just like I’m Randy Moss \nI pop em, toss em, cross em, forty, chop em\nLock em , leave his ass, Ima catch his ass \nEenie meenie meenie miney mo\nEenie meenie meenie miney mo\nEenie meenie meenie miney mo\nRunning back to never running back\nI get a running back to get my shotty back\nAnd if I bust a pussy in the Pontiac\nYou know she running back \nYou know she running back \nAnd I will probably hit it, kiss it, flip it \nRip or break a wrist I bet your bitch a bitch\nAnd if that bitch a bitch Im letting Louis kick em \nBitch Ill bust a bitch\nAnd then she a chair\nGet ya , couple bitch to whip it \n, throw a bitch a bone \nI know its in the load\nI got the bitch to go like That was your mother\nDude, that looks like a little too far back\nBlack, Ima just-", "Hola!

He fucked your girlfriend, gave her lots of drugs, and fuck her, and fuck her, right? You come home. First you took care of her for like three, four months. Take care of her for a while. She ain’t got nobody to take care of her. Clothes. Shoes. A house to stay in. A four-bedroom apartment. You feel me? Kittens. All types of crazy shit, you feel me, dropping bands. Right? You get out. The people you take care of. You get out. The day you get out, you see her, right? She kiss you on your lips, you feel me, feel up on you da da da. “I love you, I would never do anything to hurt you,” da da da. You go, you go to the, you go to the house. And your dog. Before she tell you. Before she tell you. Before he told her to tell you. Make sure you tell me the truth and I’ll forgive you. You tell her to tell you. You go home. Y’all fine, y’all smokin, y’all chillin’, da da da. You order pizza, you making sure everybody straight. You on the phone. Your dog tell you, your dog tell you that nigga fucked your bitch. Telling you he fucked your bitch. I will kill this bitch if she play with me. That’s the real deal. You feel me. On some shit like that. And I think any man would bruh. Any man would bruh.\nMan: I feel you but damn, bro.\nXXXTentacion: Yeah bro. Yeah bro. \nMan: It’s no use worrying about these things man. \nXXXTentacion: No, I know it’s not, bruh. \nMan: I understand where you’re coming from… \nXXXTentacion: Yeah. You come home. Your dogs robbing you. The niggas you took care of since they met you. And gave everybody face. Nobody dropped no money on your commissary. The only person that looked out for you was your mom. The only people that answer was really her, my mom, and my basically brother . And even then, she came to visitation, dog. Visitations telling me I could trust her, right? The first time it happened, I don’t mean to put your business out there, but I’m doing it to you since you like to put your business out there, you like to say shit about me. She came to my visitation and let me know, and I forgave her, you feel me. I had to scare it out of her. I had to sit there and scare it out of her. That’s why I’m tellin’ y’all brother. Let me do my thing, you feel me. I know how to get the truth out of her.\nSo. I’m in my . All the old heads, you know the cool ones been through this a thousand times. “Your bitch gone fucked somebody, fam, you gotta get over it. You need to forgive her and move on once you get the truth.” Once you get the truth, you feel me? But if you can’t get the truth just forget that shit. “It’s gonna happen,” they tellin’ me. I’m like, “Nah, not her bruh, she love me, she care about me, she know better, I’ma kill her, da da da, da.” You feel me? They was like, “What you gonna kill her for? You probably the type of nigga that kill your bitch and then kill yourself, ain’t it?” And I was like, “Yeah.” They was like, “That’s weak. You weak if you do that. You weak. A real man gonna forgive her, and then move on.” Once you get the truth, right?\nSo. I don’t like to be called weak. I don’t like to be called pussy. So you know what I did? I got out expecting these things. ’Cause you know what level of frequency my mind is on. I got out because I knew what was going to happen. So she did that to me, right? You know what I did? I forgave her. Pat on the back. Don’t lie to me. You feel me? She wasn’t with me at the time so I’ll give her that. She wasn’t with me. You feel me? But you just picturing. And I’ve seen it done, don’t get me wrong. And I fucked another nigga bitch while he was in jail. This bitch , I don’t know if you know her. . She used to hang out with , I fucked that shit . I ran through that shit and then I beat up . I beat up her boyfriend.\nWoman 1: I used to date .\nXXXTentacion: I beat him up. I beat that nigga up. Fuck that soft-ass nigga.\nWoman 1: You’re funny.\nXXXTentacion: I beat that soft nigga up. I slapped him. I palm-slapped him. \nSo did that to me, right? But because I was in, locked up, I’m like, “All right, OK, it’s cool.” But then, sure enough, I get out. So you know what I do, initially? ’Cause I used to fuck her up bruh. I used to fuck her up, bruh. You know what I did? I didn’t touch her. I didn’t touch her. I forgive her. I forgive her. I forgive her . I just wanted the truth. And bits and pieces kept coming out from somebody else that I’ve never heard, right? Bits and pieces, bits and pieces, bits and pieces. So I’ma say this.\nOh here go this other bitch. Hello? Twenty minutes away? All right. Just text me when you’re here.\nWoman 1: Where are you going? Where the fuck you going?\nXXXTentacion: That was just . She about to smoke me up. Y’all want some smoke? What’s his name and them supposed to still come, supposed to come. But yeah that bitch was supposed to smoke me up.\nBut yeah. She did that to me. And bruh. Shit keep comin’ out bruh. And then she’ll drop me bits and details, right? And then she tell me she don’t know what happened. Remember how she told you that she didn’t remember? When I was in that room, she says, I was like, “Tell me the truth bruh and I’ll let it go. Tell me the truth. Just tell me truth.” \nAnd then I asked her another question just to catch her in her lie. Just to catch her and make sure I know she lyin’. ’Cause now I know she lying about certain parts. And I’ma get it out of her. I’m not gonna hit her. But then I asked her, I was like, “Did sleep in that bed with you?” You know what she said before? “No.” “No.” slept in the bed with her. Now, I’m gonna tell you how I pieced together your lie. I’ma tell you in a second. I ain’t gonna hit you. I just want the truth. I want the truth so I can move on with my life.\nYeah, I pieced together one of her lies, but yeah, she slept in the bed with that nigga. She said they didn’t, but you know this bitch lying. You know this bitch lying. You know this bitch is lying. I’ma tell you everything. I’ma tell you every detail and how I finally got to piece this shit together. But , if you love or respect me, I just want the truth out of this girl, then she can leave.\nWoman 1: I can’t give y’all private time. This here. She gotta speak right now, ’cause that’s what we’re doing. Like, I’m sorry. We’re already like— \nXXXTentacion: Hell nah. \nWoman 1: Like, I feel you.\nXXXTentacion: \nWoman 1: Bro, like, I don’t know what you wanna do. Because I don’t even know you like that. Real shit. I wouldn’t disrespect you either. Out of respect not only for myself but because I wouldn’t do that to anybody. . You’re a woman so...\nUnidentified Woman: What are you asking me?\nWoman 1: I’m saying, like, what y’all wanna do.\nXXXTentacion: I’ll tell you. I’m going to leave. If you love me . I’ll leave in the morning. But if you love me, you make sure she’s straight bruh. Because as fucked up as—\nWoman 1: She can stay here!\nXXXTentacion: As much as I’ve told you. You know what’s funny as fuck, I still love this bitch bruh. It’s crazy as fuck. You’re gonna find someone. Just like you love your mom, you feel me? Just as much as you love your mom, you’re gonna find someone that make you feel equivalent. And just like you. And then you will feel how I feel. And I’m telling you. I’m telling you to your face—you’re not gonna jump off a cliff, I’m just crazy for that shit—but my nigga, you’re gonna go through the same shit. Somebody gonna hurt you this way, and you’re not gonna know how to deal with it. You’re not gonna know how to deal with it. ’Cause you’re not going to walk away, ’cause that’s your bitch. You’re not going to walk away. You’re not going to consistently hit them, because that shit, it fucked them up, you feel me?\nWoman 1: For me, it never gets to that fuckin’ point.\nMan: All right. \nWoman 1: I don’t take it \nMan: Yeah bro. I haven’t been through that bro. But did you hear what she said? I didn’t let—\nXXXTentacion: It didnt get to that point.\nMan: Exactly. Nah, look. If I see somebodys whos on some shit like you, Im with them, and then like theyre just for everybody. Then that just shows me, like, bro, I cant get too deep or, like, crazy with this person, you feel me? Because then, off rip, like, Ima have to be like always there, like, damn, shes for everybody, you feel me? And then when my back is turned, of course everybody’s gonna be for everybody so at the end of the day, you cant stop that.\nXXXTentacion: Who’s everybody? \nWoman 1: It’s different on both sides.\nMan: But listen though. At the end of the day. They do have people who know how other people move and still try to work it out, you feel me? At the end of the day you do not have to kill yourself. Love counselor or some shit. You feel me? And y’all put on all your differences. Have like a professional. \nXXXTentacion: She just need to tell me the truth.\nWoman 1: That’s one of the most annoying things, I can relate to that because that just happened to me and .\nXXXTentacion: Nigga wasn’t telling the truth.\nWoman 1: He held it, he held onto it. It wasn’t even the truth. It wasn’t even the truth. I don’t know what happened, but he heard from somebody that I cheated on him. During that, I wasn’t even with him. I was not with him. I don’t have to fuckin’ lie. \nXXXTentacion: That was the only reason why I gave her a pass on her whole situation with her ex. And I believe her. But she probably lie about that too.\nWoman 1: That’s what I’m saying . It’s annoying as fuck...\nXXXTentacion: Bruh, I’ma get myself—I’ma get arrested either way. Look, .\nWoman 1: I got over it. You can do the same but this shit?\nMan: You can get over things.\nXXXTentacion: I’ma get arrested. look, I’ma get arrested either way. Would you rather me get arrested happy, or miserable. ’Cause I will go in that shit and I will kill myself. And you know I’m capable of it. I will go in that shit and I will kill myself. So would you rather me be either happy, or miserable.\nMan: Why you are so obsessed with wanting to killing yourself?\nXXXTentacion: I’m not obsessed with wanting to kill myself.\nMan: Nah but you keep on screaming like you want to kill yourself.\nXXXTentacion: Yeah, ’cause I’ve reached a point my life bruh where there’s a lot of obstacles that are mental. You don’t know the pain bruh. You just don’t know.\nMan: Understand, but listen to me now. kill yourself bruh. That shit is like . If you feel that way you need to go a pastor and they’ll baptize you.\nWoman 1: Exactly!\nXXXTentacion: We’re different people.\nUnidentified Woman: If you want better for yourself, if you want the cycle to stop you have to go for something that will stop it. I’m not saying you’re gonna find that through a God, you could find that through any source ...\nXXXTentacion: What nobody’s understanding, I put my source of happiness in another person, which was a mistake initially, right? But she fell through on every occasion until now. Until I started fucking her up bruh. But I started fucking her up because she made one mistake. And from there, the whole cycle went down. Now she’s scared. That girl is scared for her life. Which I understand. ’Cause , you seen me. You know what I do to people. know, all of them boys knew. It’s on fucking New Times. I’m on New Times for stabbing, how many people they put in the news, they said three, it was eight. In Deerfield. She know that. She’s seen this shit. She’s seen when I came back from stabbing in Orlando. She seen when I came back. Had a brand new laptop. No tears on my face, no remorse. I just knew I was going to jail. She know. So she’s scared. She thinks I’m going to kill her. She doesn’t realize, once I hear the truth, bruh, I can make a real decision bruh. And I’m saying that to you, I’m saying that out loud. The sooner, I mean it bruh, something positive could come out of that. And I’m not forcing you to say something that—\nWoman 1: And that, that’s light right there. Something positive can come out of that. I don’t, I don’t, I don’t—please don’t get me wrong, I looked at you just now, and I seen something different. And I’m not saying that in a bad way. It’s a good way. I just seen fear in your eyes. That’s what I seen. But I feel something different. If there’s something that you’re not saying—bro.\nXXXTentacion: Just get this shit over with, bruh.\nWoman 1: You feel me?\nXXXTentacion: Look. \nWoman 1: Because I can’t—that’s it.\nUnidentified Woman: the truth. \nWoman 1: Well, see. That’s it. I don’t know. This is the thing. Either you believe that. And you leave it alone.\nXXXTentacion: It’s funny how bits and pieces come out, and every time something relevant come out, you got some new info. \nWoman 1: What else can happen? You feel me?\nXXXTentacion: All I can do at this point bruh. Nah. I got something that I’m going to say to her that’s going to make her think. I’m not going to put my hands on her, as I said, I respect y’all house. I just did something that was completely crazy as fuck. That is it for the night. Or, at all. I’m tired bruh. This shit pointless bruh.\nWoman 1: Yes.\nXXXTentacion: Nah, I mean everything bruh, I mean everything is pointless bruh. This shit all pointless.\nWoman 1: It—it may seem pointless—\nXXXTentacion: Nah, I’m not talking about life and shit, period. I’m just saying anything that has involved itself with me has been pointless. Therefore I’ma just go back bruh. I’ma go back in the morning bruh. I’ma pipe this shit up bruh. Take care of her please bruh. I’ma leave y’all with a little 500 bruh. I’ma get money and I’ma give it to her bruh. Just make sure she straight bruh. Pipe that shit up bruh.

I just need y’all to trust me. I don’t got nothing else to lose at this point, ’cause she done told me some other shit bruh that she did not tell me before so I know she’s lying. So all I can get now is the truth. I already heard enough. I’m already gonna tell her what I know.\nWoman 1: But like you just said at this point give you private time.\nXXXTentacion: I’ll go outside bruh. No, outside the front bruh. I need to talk to that girl bruh.

least wanna know that the kids perceived my message and were able to make something of themselves and able to take my message and use it and turn it into something positive and to to at least have a good life i at least if if im going to die or ever be a sacrifice i want to make sure that my life made at least 5 million kids happy or they found some sort of answers or resolved in my life
