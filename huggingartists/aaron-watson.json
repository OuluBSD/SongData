cigarette, he blew a breath of smoke that could smother\nHe said They always said these would kill me and they did then he laughed and he lit another\nHe said I hear that you write songs boy, play me one that I might know\nSo I sang him my latest greatest hit, a number one on music row\nHe stopped me before I could finish the verse, said I think Ive heard enough of that\nWhen you’ve heard one

gun\nThe pen is mightier than the sword if the words are forged from fire from the sun\nYet some do it for the fame, the fun, the money and all the glory\nYet some do it for their weary soul, wont rest until they tell their story\nYou gotta make ’em feel what you feel, help em dream a dream and make em wonder\nIts like catch lightning in a bottle, make ’em smell the rain and hear the thunder\nLet em taste the tears of joy or the bittersweet taste of sin\nFind the passion in a four letter word or a Sunday morning Amen\nAnd then he flicked his ashes and he pointed at my heart\nSaid

to heaven when I am next to you\nYou look just like an angel tangled in white satin sheets\nLying there with your hair all in a mess\nI swear you look your best all dressed up next to nothing\nNext to

ashamed\nI know I got game\nJust curious what youve got outside your frame\nLove drought\nCome fill up my aura\nStop textning, leave, go, Im alone welcome in\nLoose grip of your phone, T-shirt off lets begin\nI’m good on my own but you’re luxury, you make me feel\nGive me some of your love and youll have some of me\nOf me\nI pray, nothing gets in the way\nWe won’t loose a thing if we play\nNeed you in my bed\nI might not taste the same\nNot, not taste the same again\nStop textning, leave, go, IM alone welcome in\nLoose grip of your phone, T-shirt off lets begin\nIm good on my own but youre luxury, you make me feel\nGive me some of your love and youll have some of me"]}
